After more than two decades of a civil war that caused significant damage to the country’s social and economic infrastructure, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) was elected and recognized by the international community in 2012. With donors’ support, progress is being made in the FGS’s efforts to improve security, capacity development, and state building. However, significant challenges remain ahead to rebuild the economy and institutions and improve social conditions. The IMF resumed its relationship with Somalia in 2013 and has since been heavily involved in the provision 
of policy advice and technical assistance, particularly in the context of the 12-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) which was approved by the IMF Managing Director in May 2016. Despite a very difficult political environment and complex clan politics, the FGS continues to make significant efforts toward restoring its key economic and financial institutions and keeping the SMP on track.","February 27, 2017",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2017/02/27/Somalia-2016-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-44706,International Monetary Fund.

Since then, the situation has stabilized, and growth is estimated to have resumed modestly in 2016. Notwithstanding the substantial progress achieved by Greece, it still faces fundamental challenges: (i) a vulnerable structure of the public finances; (ii) significant tax evasion and an ineffective tax administration; (iii) impaired bank and private sector balance sheets; and (iv) pervasive structural obstacles to investment and growth.

In 1991, the government was toppled by armed opposition groups, leading to implosion of the central government and devolution of power to administrative regions. The Fund recognized the Federal Government of Somalia on April 12, 2013, paving the way for staff to provide policy advice and technical assistance. While Somalia has been welcomed back as an active member of the Fund, it remains ineligible for financial assistance pending the clearance of its longstanding arrears. The political and security situation remains challenging. Complex clan politics and high turnover in the members of the economic team have undermined policymaking. A new government took office on February 18, 2015, and presidential elections are planned for September 2016. Key policy issues: The Article IV discussions focused on immediate and medium-term actions for building institutions and policy frameworks for fiscal and financial management. Specifically, • Capacity building and governance. Concerted action is needed to build institutions and improve governance in order to support sustainable, inclusive growth, and poverty reduction. In particular, urgent efforts are required to set in place sound mechanisms and institutions to ensure that prospective natural resource wealth, notably hydrocarbons, is well managed. Considerable donor assistance is required for helping Somalia to meet these daunting challenges. • Fiscal. Decisive steps are necessary to build fiscal discipline, underpinned by realistic budgeting and effective implementation systems, including commitment controls. The 2015 budget needs to be revised in light of revenue shortfalls. An emergency revenue mobilization plan and an expenditure review are warranted. • Financial sector. Efforts are needed to develop the currently rudimentary financial system. Swift action is required so that remittances can be channeled through the international banking system. Currency reform should not be implemented until prerequisites are in place. Given the extent of dollarization and the absence of monetary policy instruments, the central bank is unable to conduct monetary policy. Past IMF advice: The latest Article IV consultation was on November 13, 1989, and focused on the low priority attached by the government in place then on the need for better controlling unproductive spending, and on the need for better economic and social services.","July 29, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Somalia-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-43136,International Monetary Fund.

Donor-financed large infrastructure projects, increased public spending, and a pick-up in credit to households have boosted real GDP growth to close to 4 percent in 2014 and to about 3 percent in 2015. Inflation remains low, underpinned by lower food and commodity prices. Steps are being taken to reduce the many hurdles to private growth that Kiribati faces, among which are high transportation and communication costs and an increasing impact of climate change. Fiscal policy. The fiscal outlook has improved, but further efforts are needed to ensure sustainability. The recurrent balance was in large surplus in 2014 and is expected to remain positive in 2015, reflecting high revenue from license fees, and notwithstanding a large increase in expenditures. But under the historic pace of spending the sovereign wealth fund (Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund—RERF) would be depleted in about 20 years. Ensuring sustainability requires containing nominal expenditure growth to around 1½ per annum over the next five years (after accommodating climate-change-related costs), with transparent and symmetric transfers and withdrawals from the RERF around this path. Structural reforms. There is a consensus among donors that significant progress has been achieved. The State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) Reform Act is being implemented in a satisfactory way, as illustrated by the recent successful privatization of the telecommunication company. Key outstanding issues include further reforming the energy and copra sectors and improving the investment climate.","July 29, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Kiribati-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-and-Staff-Report-43133,International Monetary Fund.

The recovery is strengthening, underpinned by lower oil prices and the ECB’sexpanded asset purchase program. But the medium-term outlook remains weak, weighed down by the legacies of insufficient demand, lagging productivity, and weak bank and corporate balance sheets.
Policies. A concerted, collective effort is needed to sustain the recovery, avoid overburdening monetary policy, and lift potential growth over the medium term, which would have positive spillovers for the rest of the world:
Demand support. Quantitative easing (QE) has boosted confidence and improved financial conditions. The ECB’s clear communication to stay the course on QE until inflation is on a sustained adjustment path will help anchor expectations. Countries should adhere to the SGP, but those with fiscal space should use it to support investment and structural reforms.
Balance sheet repair. High non-performing loans (NPLs) in some banks are eroding profitability and discouraging new lending. Complementary policies are needed to incentivize NPL resolution through strengthened prudential supervision, insolvency reforms, and development of distressed debt markets. Asset management companies (AMCs) could help banks to offload NPLs and assist with corporaterestructuring.Productivity-enhancing structural reforms. Labor and product market reformsshould be combined with faster implementation of the Services Directive, further improvements of insolvency regimes, and a greater push toward a single market in capital, transport, energy, and the digital economy. A capital markets union would help diversify funding sources and reduce reliance on bank lending.
Better economic governance. A more effective and simpler governance framework, including a move towards ""outcome-based"" benchmarking, could help advance  structural reforms, while the fiscal framework could be simplified and strengthened.

Economic activity strengthened somewhat in 2014 while the external current account deficit worsened primarily as a result of Baha Mar construction-related imports. The authorities continue to make substantial progress on fiscal consolidation with successful VAT implementation in January 2015 setting the stage for continued improvements in the fiscal position. Lower oil prices helped keep inflation anchored in 2014. Still, notwithstanding the capital flow management (CFM) regime, international reserves remain low. Key policy advice: Despite the U.S. recovery and the imminent opening of the Baha Mar resort, the growth outlook remains well below pre-global crisis levels, and strong and timely measures should be implemented to strengthen competitiveness and raise potential growth. In addition, rebuilding fiscal and external buffers will be essential for sustaining macroeconomic stability: • Reigniting strong and inclusive medium-term growth. Structural reforms are needed to address longstanding competiveness issues including labor market impediments to growth. Energy sector reforms could substantially lower energy costs, boost productivity and facilitate economic diversification in the medium term. A diversification strategy should explore the potential for increasing value added in the tourism sector, including through deepening linkages with agriculture. • Rebuilding fiscal and external buffers. Notwithstanding the CFM regime, the fixed exchange rate peg constrains monetary policy, leaving fiscal policy as the main instrument for macroeconomic stabilization. Steadfast implementation of the VAT and expenditure rationalization in the context of a medium-term budgetary framework, together with public enterprise reforms, would help rebuild fiscal buffers and support international reserves. • Preserving financial sector stability. The pre-crisis credit boom has left the banking system with an overhang of non-performing loans, which will likely continue to generate headwinds for the economy. Despite this, the banking system remains very well capitalized and liquid. Measures should be put in place to resolve the debt overhang while further strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework.","July 27, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/The-Bahamas-Staff-Report-for-the-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-43125,International Monetary Fund.

Building on initial positive results, policies now need to embark on a sustained effort to meet the unprecedented challenges Japan is facing: ending an entrenched deflationary mindset, raising growth, restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, and maintaining financial stability in the face of adverse demographics. Japan should be at the vanguard of structural reform. More vigorous efforts to raise labor supply and deregulate domestic markets, backed by further endeavors to raise wages and investment and designed to boost confidence and raise domestic demand, will be essential to lift growth, facilitate fiscal consolidation, and unburden monetary policy. A credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan is needed to remove uncertainty about the direction of policies that may be holding back domestic demand. The overarching goal should be to put debt on a downward path, through gradual but steady consolidation that does not derail growth and inflation momentum. It should be based on prudent economic assumptions and on concrete structural revenue and expenditure measures identified upfront. More explicit monetary guidance would enhance inflation dynamics. Actual and expected inflation remain well below the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) inflation target and monetary policy transmission remains weak. The BoJ needs to stand ready to undertake further easing and should provide stronger guidance to markets through enhanced communication. Absent deeper structural reforms, even with further easing, reaching two- percent inflation in a stable manner is likely to take longer than envisaged, suggesting that the BoJ should put greater emphasis on achieving the inflation target in a stable manner rather than within a specific time frame. The financial sector should be a greater catalyst for growth, and guard against risks from unconventional policies. The soundness of the financial system allows more risk taking and consolidation, while remaining resilient to the likely higher volatility of asset prices, exchange rates and interest rates, and lower liquidity in the JGB market as quantitative easing proceeds. While the 2014 external position was assessed to be broadly aligned with fundamentals, subsequent developments and incomplete policies raise the risk of negative spillovers. With the depreciation of the yen relative to its mid-2014 level, further monetary easing without bolder structural reforms and a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan could lead to sluggish domestic demand and overreliance on yen depreciation to pursue domestic policy objectives.","July 23, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Japan-Staff-Report-for-the-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-43107,International Monetary Fund.

Fiscal policy has been supportive of the recovery and the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective is appropriate, but fiscal framework legislation that would anchor policy is yet to be approved. The central bank’s use of an exchange rate floor as an additional instrument to achieve its inflation objective, in the context of the inflation- targeting framework, has helped stem deflationary pressures, but inflation is still well below target. The financial system is sound and resilient to shocks. The challenge for the authorities is to safeguard macroeconomic stability and create conditions for strong and sustainable growth. Policy recommendations. • Fiscal policy. Maintain a supportive fiscal stance this year, but embark on a modest and very gradual fiscal consolidation thereafter, consistent with the medium-term deficit objective. Embed this objective in a comprehensive framework to enhance its effectiveness in anchoring fiscal policy. Improve budget composition, with higher capital spending to address infrastructure needs offset by efficiency gains in current expenditure and improved revenue administration. • Monetary policy. Continue to focus on inflation targeting in policymaking and communication, and maintain supportive monetary conditions until deflation risks recede and inflation expectations become entrenched around the inflation target. Consider carefully the timing and mechanics of the eventual normalization of monetary policy. • Financial sector. Remain vigilant and be ready to address possible risks to financial stability. • Structural reforms.

in improved economic and social outcomes. Continued policy discipline and reforms are needed for 
the microstate to mitigate its geographical and population constraints and maintain momentum in 
developing a diversified and resilient economy.
Focus: With the fiscal stance anchored by the authorities’ debt reduction objective, macroeconomic 
discussions concentrated on the smooth functioning of monetary and exchange rate policies. On the 
structural agenda, the dialogue focused on policies to promote sustained and inclusive growth, 
particularly on the appropriate role for state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Review: The program is on track. The authorities met the end-December quantitative performance 
criteria except for narrowly exceeding the ceiling on reserve money. The structural agenda remains 
broadly on track despite some delays. Staff recommends completion of the second review under the 
Extended Arrangement and modification of the performance criteria for end-June and end-December 
2015, and supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for  the end-December 2014 performance 
criterion for reserve money.
Outlook and risks: With the external position having stabilized since the last review, fundamentals 
are strengthening. However, the economy remains highly vulnerable to global developments, including 
weakness in the key European markets, while domestic risks center on the role of the SOEs.
Recommendations: The authorities’ objective of reducing public debt below 50 percent of GDP by 2018 
remains an appropriate and attainable anchor for fiscal policy. The monetary policy framework 
should be further enhanced by increasing its forward orientation in the context of a flexible 
exchange rate. Structural measures should focus on fostering inclusiveness and private sector-led 
growth, while improving economic governance and the focus of SOEs.
Data: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Priority areas include improved GDP 
statistics, strengthening external sector statistics, and extending coverage of the international 
investment position.","July 22, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Seychelles-Staff-Report-for-the-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-Second-Review-Under-the-43111,International Monetary Fund.

As Singapore prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary in August, its economy continues to perform well. Despite the slow pace of the global recovery and a gradual decline in domestic credit growth and housing prices, projected economic growth of about 2.9 percent in 2015 is consistent with full employment and price stability. Growth is projected to slow down in the medium term, consistent with reduced reliance on foreign workers and rapid population aging. The authorities’ new growth model takes into account Singapore’s physical resource limits and aims to boost labor and land productivity. Risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside: Singapore’s highly open economy is exposed to external shocks, most notably slower global growth and the side effects from volatility in global financial markets. Domestic vulnerabilities, including elevated private indebtedness, can amplify the impact of external shocks. Policies. In January, in response to a decline in expected inflation and a more uncertain outlook for growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced the pace of appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) band. The more benign near?to medium-term inflation outlook warrants the relative easing of monetary policy. The monetary policy framework is robust and flexible but rising domestic leverage and heightened global interest rate and exchange rate volatility warrant heightened vigilance in assessing the balance of forces between the various channels of monetary policy. Singapore continues to maintain high regulatory and supervisory standards. Recent macroprudential measures have contributed to smoothing the cycle for credit and house prices. The budget’s focus on boosting productivity, equality of opportunity, and inclusiveness is laudable, while the fiscal impulse is opportune given cyclical conditions. Restructuring and population aging. Building on Singapore’s success and faced with high income inequality and the physical limits of a city state, the authorities have re-engineered the country’s growth model to boost productivity while reducing reliance on foreign workers. The restructuring entails lower steady state growth and a shift in the functional distribution of income toward labor. Incentives provided for firms to increase productivity-enhancing investments and for Singaporeans to upgrade their skills should help ensure a successful transition. But slower potential growth and a lower share of profits in income could affect those investments, and gains in productivity could be realized only slowly. Flexibility in the application of foreign worker policies and continued review of incentives are warranted. The authorities are recalibrating fiscal policies with associated inter?and intra- generational impacts in order to proactively deal with Singapore’s rapid population aging, enhance inclusiveness and reduce inequality, while remaining true to the principles of individual responsibility and sound public finances.","July 22, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Singapore-Staff-Report-for-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-43109,International Monetary Fund.

Guinea-Bissau has re-initiated progress since the assumption of office of the current inclusive government in mid-2014. The economy is now recovering after a decline in 2012 and marginal growth in 2013. Inflation remains low, and socio-political stability seems achievable. The coup d’état of April 2012 stalled implementation of the three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)- supported program approved by the Board in May 2010, and the arrangement lapsed subsequently. The Fund’s support under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) disbursement of 2014 and the authorities’ commitment to reforms have re-ignited donor confidence. Article IV Discussions. Policy discussions focused on measures to overcome fragility; fiscal consolidation and public financial management reforms; restoring financial stability; borrowing policies and long-term debt sustainability; private sector development and structural reforms to enhance inclusive growth prospects. The Proposed Program. The authorities’ development program, anchored on the Strategic Plan for 2014–18, aims to consolidate the fiscal position through better expenditure management and enhanced revenue mobilization, deepen institutional reform, mitigate vulnerabilities, and develop the private sector to support growth and employment. The program focuses on improving the policy framework by addressing governance and security issues, strengthening budgetary transparency as well as public investment and debt management, and improving compilation of statistics. Structural benchmarks focus on these issues while QPCs include a floor on revenues collection and a ceiling on net credit to government (the anchor of the program). Request for an Extended Credit Facility Arrangement. To support their medium-term economic reform program, the authorities request a three-year arrangement under the ECF in an amount equivalent to SDR 17.04 million (120 percent of quota).

Growth is recovering gradually from natural disasters and inflation remains subdued. The current account deficit is expected to narrow on lower international oil prices and a planned fiscal consolidation. The main external risk is the occurrence of another natural disaster in the presence of already high public debt and vulnerabilities in financial institutions. The main domestic risks center around a delay in rebuilding macroeconomic buffers, in particular through fiscal consolidation, reforms of public financial institutions and financial oversight. Improving financial resilience. A recent financial sector assessment program (FSAP) mission identified risks in some commercial banks and public financial institutions (PFIs). The role of PFIs needs to be refocused to reduce contingent liabilities for public finances and to support the development of private financial markets. Regulation and supervision of financial institutions needs to be improved to reduce the risk of an adverse feedback loop from banks and PFIs to the public finances in case of another external shock. Rebuilding macroeconomic buffers. A gradual fiscal consolidation is planned to reduce public debt to the target of 50 percent of GDP by 2020, mainly through improvements in revenue and a reduction in current expenditure. While there is no significant evidence of misalignment, and reserves are adequate by standard metrics, a stronger external position with higher reserves would provide greater resilience. Boosting growth. The authorities’ structural reform initiatives emphasize a revitalization of agriculture and food processing, tourism, and an enabling environment for business. Reforms to SOE governance are beginning to bear fruit, but the government should stay the course in planned privatizations and amendments to legislation to reduce the burden of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on the public finances. Improvements in financial infrastructure will improve the flow and allocation of credit.","July 20, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Samoa-2015-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-Executive-43096,International Monetary Fund.

The new government that came to power in June 2014 inherited serious fiscal and external payments problems, including arrears to the Fund and other creditors, and unresolved banking sector problems. Moreover, public debt remains at an unsustainable level of close to 100 percent of GDP, while economic activity has been weak with output still well below the level reached at the time of the 2008/09 global financial crisis. Main policy recommendations • Implement fiscal measures equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to tackle cash flow problems and achieve an underlying primary surplus of 3.0 percent of GDP by 2016 to address debt sustainability challenges. Underpin measures with structural fiscal reforms. • Use Citizenship by Investment Program revenues to pay down arrears and debt and fund bank resolution. The program should be managed in line with the high standards of governance and transparency set out in the law. • Move expeditiously as planned with the resolution of ABI Bank and support initiatives underway to strengthen the regional bank resolution framework, in particular, the passage of needed legislative reforms. • Improve competitiveness by moderating labor costs; increasing energy efficiency, including by better performance of the state-owned utility company; and improving the investment climate. Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic situation and risks, and its recommendations to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and strengthen the banking system. They were more optimistic about growth prospects for 2015 based on expectations for substantial FDI. They are opposed to increases in taxes and plan to focus fiscal efforts on cutting recurrent spending. On bank resolution, they wish to work closely with the Fund and World Bank to speedily address outstanding problems. They paid the arrears to the Fund and committed to timely servicing of Fund obligations. Data provision. Data provision is adequate for surveillance and post-program monitoring although significant areas for improvement remain, in particular on labor market statistics, measurement of arrears, financial information on state-owned enterprises, and national accounts by expenditure components.","July 17, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Antigua-and-Barbuda-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Second-Post-43087,International Monetary Fund.

Economic growth in  2014 is projected at 3.3 percent, adversely affected by electricity disruptions and  slower-than-expected implementation of the public investment program. Inflation has remained  subdued. Staffs’ baseline assumption is that real GDP growth will average around 4 percent per  annum over the medium term, provided reforms are implemented.  •    Implementation of the 2014 budget was challenging, particularly after mid-year. While revenues  were broadly on target, resources were inadequate to meet the higher- than-budgeted wage bill  resulting from an increase in teacher salaries in March and previously un-budgeted expenditures,  including on elections. Domestically-financed investment spending was severely constrained and  temporary arrears were incurred on salaries and external debt.  •    The key short-term challenge is to find a better balance between available resources and  expenditures so that arrears can be avoided. Spending plans need to be based on realistic  expectations of the resources likely to be available. The 2015 budget is premised on this principle  but the scope for domestically-financed investment is inadequate as obligatory spending on wages  and salaries and debt service absorbs most of domestic revenue.  •     For the medium-term the key challenges are to create fiscal space for infrastructure  investment and social spending, accelerate inclusive growth and employment generation, and reduce  poverty.

Mauritania’s economy has benefited from macroeconomic stability and high growth in the context of contained inflation, responsible macro-policies, high iron ore prices and scaled-up public investment. However, economic growth has not translated into broadly improved living standards and is being hit by a sharp decline in iron ore prices. Outlook and Risks. Although the outlook remains favorable, it hinges heavily on stabilizing iron ore prices and expanding mining capacity. Downside risks to the outlook dominate because iron ore prices may decline further in response to excess supply in the global market. Key Policy Recommendations. With high risk of debt distress and deteriorating terms of trade, Mauritania’s fiscal policy needs to remain focused on consolidation to support fiscal sustainability. Over the medium term, a fiscal framework with a full-fledged fiscal rule will help prevent the boom–bust cycles that ensue from volatility in natural resource revenue, and with strengthened governance in managing mining wealth. The central bank should take advantage of the low-inflation environment to strengthen monetary policy formulation, gradually liberalize the foreign exchange market, and introduce liquidity support and banking resolution frameworks. The implementation of the recent FSAP recommendations should be pursued to enhance the stability of the financial sector stability. Economic diversification and inclusive growth are the foremost medium-term challenges. The authorities should accelerate structural reforms needed to raise Mauritania’s potential growth, create jobs, and improve living standards for all Mauritanians. Article VIII.

For a number of years Egypt has suffered from low and  non-inclusive growth and from high unemployment. Since 2011 these          problems have been  compounded by large fiscal deficits and rising public debt and by external fragility evidenced by  loss of foreign exchange reserves. In 2014, Egypt adopted a new constitution and elected a new  president who was candid with the electorate on the need to reform the economy. The government has  developed a plan centered on structural reform and investment promotion to raise growth and create  jobs, and fiscal adjustment to bring the budget deficit and public debt under control. Crucially,  the authorities have already begun to implement fuel subsidy reform, raising prices by 40–80  percent in July 2014. They have also begun the reforms needed to raise tax revenue and to make  Egypt a more attractive destination for investment. There was agreement that the authorities’ objectives are ambitious but are broadly within reach  with steady policy implementation. The authorities aim to raise growth to 6 percent per annum,  reduce annual inflation to 7 percent, bring down the fiscal deficit to 8 percent of GDP and debt to 80–85 percent of GDP, and increase foreign exchange reserves to 3½  months of imports, all within the next five years. Staff considers these objectives appropriately  ambitious, although targeting a higher level of reserves would be prudent. It believes that the  authorities’ policies, if followed steadfastly, are broadly consistent with these objectives, but  noted that a number of policies—including the details of some fiscal measures and structural  measures to improve the business environment—are still being formulated. The authorities and the staff differed somewhat on the extent of vulnerabilities and risks. The  authorities are confident that they will be able to follow through on their policies and that  improved confidence will lead to a surge in foreign investment, a pickup in tourism, and strong  economic growth. Staff emphasized that the authorities’ policies would still leave significant  vulnerabilities, namely high public debt and large financing gaps, which would need to be covered  by greater adjustment or financing, or a combination of the two. Staff also pointed to the  difficulty of maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies over a long period, the risks of  dilution of structural reform efforts, and the uncertain regional security environment. To contain  these vulnerabilities and risks, staff recommended developing contingency measures in the budget,  taking steps to build up reserves buffers, and greater exchange rate flexibility to restore  competitiveness. However, staff also agreed that with steadfast commitment to reform, Egypt’s  prospects could be stronger than assumed in staff’s projections. In particular, the recovery in investment could exceed expectations.","February 11, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Arab-Republic-of-Egypt-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42692,International Monetary Fund.

The level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) remains high and public debt has risen sharply in recent years. Fiscal policy: Medium-term funding needs to roll over existing debt and to fund budget deficits are large. A new highway, budgeted to cost about one quarter of GDP, will cause deficits  to widen and add to public debt. The draft 2015 budget shows appropriate restraint on other  spending, but a long period of strong fiscal discipline will be needed to manage fiscal risks.  Laying out clear long-term plans for managing the public finances would boost credibility and  reduce risks to market access. Fundamental expenditure reform, especially of the pension system and  the public sector wage bill, would be an essential part of such plans.  Financial sector: The banking system’s liquidity appears comfortable; however, profitability is low  and lending spreads are high. Regulatory provisioning is set higher than that reported under  international accounting standards, but a wide range of provisioning levels across banks and weak  incentives to take losses remain concerns. A more transparent and comprehensive reporting  environment would be beneficial. Reforms to ensure better enforcement of contracts and collateral would help bring down structural  lending risk premia.  Structural reform: Higher levels of labor participation and employment are needed to boost  potential growth and safeguard the public finances. Ensuring that wages adjust in line with  productivity alongside reforms to achieve better employment outcomes and boost productivity would  enhance the economy’s ability to respond to macroeconomic shocks, and are even more important in a  country that lacks its own currency and with decreasing fiscal buffers.","February 4, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Montenegro-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42678,International Monetary Fund.

Weak economic growth has  contributed to persistent and increasing poverty with deteriorating social indicators. In a fragile  environment, the uncertainty linked to political instability, weak institutions, and weak  governance has eroded the foundation for solid economic growth, with short-term rent-seeking having  taken precedence over longer-term nation building.  Outlook and Risks: The authorities are at a crossroads. A well-prioritized medium-term economic  program that is implemented concertedly would increase growth and reduce poverty. This will require  resources in order to undertake essential investment in infrastructure, as well as to increase  social spending on education and health. However, there are downside risks, whereby a slow pace of  reform implementation would keep Madagascar on a path of economic stagnation and persistent  poverty.  Fiscal Policy: There is a need to increase fiscal space in order to raise the level and efficiency  of pro-poor/pro-growth spending while preserving debt sustainability. This will involve a  broadening of the tax base, supported by a comprehensive revenue mobilization strategy, improving  the composition and quality of budgetary spending, and reinforcing public financial management.  Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: To facilitate an active monetary policy and safeguard  macroeconomic stability, it will be important to increase central bank independence, strengthen its  oversight mechanisms, and recapitalize the central bank. A floating regime remains appropriate, but it will be important to ensure that the foreign exchange  market is liquid and reflects market conditions.  Structural Reforms: There is a need to strengthen the economic climate, including through improved  governance and social development policies that would send a clear signal, both within society and  to development partners, confirming the government’s commitment to reform.

Key domestic vulnerabilities in housing markets  and the household sector remain elevated but contained fro                    m a financial  stability perspective.  Policies for balanced and sustained recovery: An appropriate policy mix should help facilitate  rebalancing to generate a broader and more durable recovery, reduce domestic vulnerabilities, and  further strengthen financial system resilience: •     Macro policies: Monetary policy can remain accommodative for now given that inflation  expectations are well-anchored, stronger business investment is still a missing link, risks to an  export-led recovery are to the downside, and housing markets are expected to cool as U.S. interest  rates rise and with lower oil prices. Fiscal consolidation should proceed in light of longer-term  challenges at the provincial level, but federal authorities should consider adopting a neutral  stance going forward, using available fiscal resources for targeted measures to support growth.  Structural policies to improve productivity in the economy would increasingly need to complement  this policy mix. •    Housing sector and financial sector policies: Further macro-prudential policy action may be  needed to guard against risks to financial stability if household balance sheet vulnerabilities  resume rising. Reforms to limit government exposure to housing markets and encourage appropriate  risk retention by the private sector should continue. Improving complex coordination across federal  and provincial authorities in supervision and stress- testing of depository institutions and  strengthening macro-prudential and crisis management frameworks will reinforce the resilience of  Canada’s financial system.  Policy response to past advice: Since the 2013 Article IV Consultation mission, the authorities  have taken some further steps to limit taxpayer exposure to the housing sector and strengthen  mortgage insurance underwriting practices. Some work on FSAP recommendations has also started to  enhance stress testing, address data gaps, and towards establishing a cooperative capital markets  system. The authorities have also intensified their efforts towards addressing interprovincial trade barriers and export diversification.","January 30, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Canada-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42673,International Monetary Fund.

The government is committed to implementing the “Plan Sénégal Emergent” (PSE),  which contains valid diagnostics and policies to boost growth and accelerate poverty reduction. GDP  growth is projected to rise from less than 4 percent in recent years to 4.5 percent in 2014.  Inflation remains low. Growth can potentially reach 7 percent by 2019 if PSE- related reforms are  consistently and rapidly implemented. The authorities believe this growth rate will be achieved two  years earlier. The impact of Ebola on growth will be limited in 2014 but can become substantial in  2015 should the epidemic spread in the region.  Fiscal stance. The fiscal outlook has improved owing to stronger revenue performance and  expenditure control, and the overall deficit is expected to fall to about 5 percent of GDP in 2014.  The 2015 budget targets a further reduction in the deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP, less ambitious  than the 4.0 percent of GDP recommended by staff. However, the authorities expect to limit the  deficit close to the level recommended by staff by holding back appropriations for new public  investment projects until feasibility studies are ready. Staff and authorities agreed that  Ebola-related shocks could add 0.3 percent of GDP to the deficit in 2015. The authorities remain  committed to bringing the fiscal deficit in line with the WAEMU target of 3 percent of GDP in the  medium term.  Structural reforms. The PSE offers an achievable development strategy, including the right mix of  private investment to be crowded in by public investment in both human capital and infrastructure.  However, unlocking private investment, including FDI, requires speeding up reforms to the business  climate and improving public sector governance. Frontloading public investment without implementing  the necessary structural reforms may jeopardize fiscal targets and debt sustainability while  failing to raise growth from its sub-par trend.  Program implementation. Performance under the PSI-supported program has been satisfactory with  end-June 2014 program targets met except for a minor breach of the non- concessional borrowing  ceiling due to weak debt management. This borrowing does not materially affect debt sustainability,  and debt management weaknesses are being addressed.  Staff recommends completion of the eighth PSI review and proposes a waiver of nonobservance of the assessment criterion on non-concessional borrowing.","January 14, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Senegal-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Eighth-Review-Under-the-Policy-42578,International Monetary Fund.

Main policy issues •        A reduction in the fiscal deficit of 3½ percent of GDP is needed over the next three years  to place public debt on a sustainable path to maintain access to market financing on favorable  terms. This adjustment should be accompanied by well- targeted social spending to protect the most  vulnerable and continued progress in lessening inequality.  •        A broad strategy is also needed to reduce the growing imbalances in the pension system and  restore its sustainability for future generations. In this regard, a broad- based dialog across all  segments of Salvadoran society is needed to build support for a reform that should include an  increase in the retirement age and introduce a progressive taxation of benefits. Steps are also  needed to further strengthen public financial management to mitigate key fiscal risks, including by  enhancing expenditure monitoring and control (to avoid future spending arrears) and recording  contingent fiscal liabilities transparently in the fiscal accounts.  •        The authorities’ goal of raising potential growth to 3 percent while reducing inequality  will require substantial supply-side measures to enhance productivity and competitiveness. These  should aim to reduce red-tape, increase access to credit, upgrade infrastructure, provide access to  and lower the cost of energy, and diversifying the economy. The FOMILENIO II grant from the U.S.  provides a valuable opportunity to catalyze such growth-enhancing reforms.  •        Banking indicators appear sound, a product of prudent supervision and regulation.  Nonetheless, there is scope to further strengthen the institutional underpinnings for financial stability by upgrading the legal framework  for bank resolution and by creating an appropriate liquidity safety net for banks.","January 12, 2015",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/El-Salvador-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42594,International Monetary Fund.

Despite progress in implementing policies to address the  resulting imbalances, inflation remains high and growth sluggish. Macroeconomic adjustment has been  complicated by structural weaknesses, a heavy debt burden, U.S. sanctions, and volatile domestic  and regional political factors. The authorities embarked earlier this year on a stabilization  program supported by a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program runs through end-2014, and the  authorities have not yet decided if they want a new SMP; the mission for the third SMP review in  December will discuss the matter with them.  Developments, outlook, and risks. Economic performance this year has been mixed as growth has  remained subdued and inflation still high at about 40 percent. Growth is expected to rebound in  2015, but the outlook remains uncertain. The risks are largely tilted to the downside, although  prospects of a successful national dialogue could lead to resolution of domestic conflicts and  improved international relations.  Article IV. Discussions focused on policies to secure macroeconomic stability,  strengthen social  safety nets, and a move to sustainable and inclusive growth. Fiscal consolidation (through revenue  mobilization and expenditure rationalization, including a gradual phase-out of fuel subsidies)  should continue, accompanied by increased public investment and social spending. Tight monetary  policy and lower central bank financing of the government should help lower inflation. There is  also a need for steps to lower the large premium in the foreign exchange market. Stronger  supervision is needed to improve banks’ resilience. More should be done to improve the business  climate to boost growth.  Program performance: The program remains on track. The authorities continue to minimize  non-concessional borrowing and maintain satisfactory track record of payments to the Fund. They  recently devalued the official exchange rate by 3 percent to help address external imbalances,  which together with a large appreciation of the parallel market rate, has helped lower the premium. Going forward, priority should be given to further reducing inflation by continuing fiscal consolidation, tightening monetary policy,  and gradually closing the gap between the official and parallel exchange rates.  Debt relief. Relief requires reaching out to creditors, normalizing relations with international  financial institutions, and continuing to establish a track record of cooperation with the IMF on  policies and payments. The authorities’ agreement with South Sudan to extend the “zero option” by two years is a positive step.","December 30, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Sudan-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Second-Review-Under-the-Staff-42573,International Monetary Fund.

As a very  open economy, Singapore is particularly exposed to external risks related to a protracted period of  slower growth in advanced and emerging economies, a continued buildup and eventual unwinding of  excess capacity in China, an abrupt surge in financial market volatility as investors reassess  underlying risks, and geopolitical risks.  Medium- and long-term challenges. The authorities focus squarely on the implementation of their  medium-term economic restructuring plan. With the aim to boost the productivity of labor and land,  the plan could set the stage for a new era of sustainable growth. However, productivity  improvements may take some time to materialize. For example, the slowing inflow of foreign workers,  a key part of the reform agenda, could moderate potential growth and lower competitiveness in light  of the tight labor market. The social safety net is being strengthened in the context of a rapidly  aging population.  Policy assessment. Singapore continues to implement a strong set of macroeconomic and financial  sector policies. The moderately tight monetary policy remains appropriate but the fiscal stance is  looser than would be warranted by cyclical considerations. The 2014 budget focuses on noncyclical considerations, including support for companies’ efforts to  raise productivity and additional social spending on healthcare for the elderly. The authorities’  plan to raise social and infrastructure spending by 1-2 percent of GDP over the medium term should help reduce the large current account surplus.  Financial regulation and supervision is among the best globally and Singapore is a frontrunner in  implementing global regulatory reforms. Macroprudential policies have contributed to cool the  housing and car permit markets and good progress has been made in implementing key short•term FSAP  recommendations.","October 17, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Singapore-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42393,International Monetary Fund.

Economic performance has improved over the last year. The recovery is taking hold,  although domestic activity remains weak, in part constrained by weak banks and inefficient  state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Inflation has declined, the current account remains in large  surplus, and international reserves have increased. The authorities place a priority on preserving  macroeconomic stability, tackling banking sector vulnerabilities, and reforming SOEs, though  implementation has been gradual in some key areas. Outlook and risks. Growth is projected to recover gradually over the coming years, with the current  account returning to a deficit and inflation contained. On current policies, public debt is  projected to reach 60 percent of GDP. Risks include weaker trading partner growth, geopolitical  tensions, slow structural reforms, and delayed fiscal consolidation. Early conclusion to key trade negotiations would be growth-positive. Fiscal policy. Deficits have been sizable and rising public debt requires attention. A medium-term  growth-friendly consolidation is recommended, based on enhancing revenue and rationalizing  unproductive expenditures while preserving crucial social and capital spending. This would ensure  public debt sustainability with space to address contingent liabilities from banking sector and SOE  restructuring. Monetary and exchange rate policy. The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Greater  exchange rate flexibility would help buffer external shocks, facilitate improved reserve adequacy,  and help lay the groundwork for shifting toward using inflation as a nominal anchor over the medium  term. Banking sector reform. Several policy measures have been taken recently, but the overall gradual  approach will likely continue constraining credit growth and keep the system susceptible to shocks  and significant asset deterioration. A more expeditious recognition of nonperforming loans, bank  restructuring and orderly resolution would support robust credit creation and macro-financial  stability. State-owned enterprise reform. Progress is being made. Implementing restructuring plans and  accelerating equitization would help ensure more efficient resource allocation, strengthen banks,  and deliver higher future growth. Reform should also focus on strengthening corporate governance  and ensuring a level playing field.","October 16, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Vietnam-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42391,International Monetary Fund.

Key economic reform priorities are being realized. However, macroeconomic and  financial risks are building, and capacity constraints are slowing institutional reform.  Constitutional amendments are being considered ahead of the 2015 elections, and peace negotiations  are continuing despite religious and ethnic tensions.  Macroeconomic situation and outlook: Growth is accelerating, with average growth projected around  8¼ percent in the next few years, and inflation should remain broadly stable. After depreciating in  2013, the exchange rate has stabilized. The external current account has widened despite improved  export performance but rising capital account inflows should enable Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM)’s  international reserves to grow rapidly from their current low levels. Monetary aggregates are  growing at double-digit rates. The underlying fiscal deficit in 2013/14 is estimated at 3 percent  of GDP and is forecast to widen to around 5½ percent of GDP in 2014/15, but should decline below 5 percent of GDP in the medium term. However, off budget operations could increase the deficit.  Risks also arise from capacity constraints and thin fiscal and external buffers.  Medium- and long-term prospects: Economic prospects remain strong. Myanmar’s long-run growth  potential is estimated at around 7 percent, in line with peer countries’ experience, but sound  institutional and policy frameworks need to be built to realize this.  Key policy recommendations: Macroeconomic policy challenges are likely to intensify in the short  term. Monetary policy tools need to be more aggressively deployed, and mechanisms established to  transfer public sector foreign exchange earnings automatically to the CBM. The regulatory framework  for the banking sector needs to be urgently upgraded and supervision strengthened, particularly as  foreign banks will soon enter. Tax policy and administration should aim at simplifying the system  and preparing for the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT).  Technical assistance (TA): Capacity building will be crucial to achieve policy objectives. The IMF  continues to provide intensive TA in key areas, including in a wide range of CBM operations, tax  policy and administration, public financial management and statistics.","October 6, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Myanmar-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42387,International Monetary Fund.

Restrained fiscal and monetary policies have helped  maintain macroeconomic stability, although the financing mode of the continuing large-scale  investment through public enterprises could risk undermining macroeconomic stability. A cautious  policy stance will be critical in preserving the recent gains.  Focus of the consultation: The discussions centered on policies to sustain strong economic growth  and promote structural transformation. Issues covered included: (i) the policy mix to preserve  macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability; (ii) the public sector investment program and its  financing; and (iii) financial deepening, export competitiveness and the business climate.  Outlook and Risks: Growth is expected to remain strong, driven mainly by agriculture and services.  Inflation should continue to remain in single digits, in line with a tight monetary policy. Key  downside risks include insufficient financing for infrastructure investment in the Growth and  Transformation Plan (GTP), lower prices of main export commodities, and weather-related shocks,  particularly a drought.  Policy mix: Staff recommendations focused on sustaining a cautious policy stance, prioritization of  public investments and closer monitoring of state-owned enterprises to ensure prudent borrowing in  the context of a medium-term debt management strategy, enhancing export competitiveness, greater  resource mobilization and development of the financial sector, and a more prominent role for the  private sector. Structural improvements in the functioning of the money and foreign exchange market  and building foreign reserves to at least three months of imports were suggested to enhance  resiliency.

The new government  has started the process of devolution at a fast pace, introducing a reporting framework that allows  for monitoring progress and challenges. Macroeconomic stability in a market-friendly environment  continues attracting the interest of foreign investors. Kenya placed its first US$2 billion  Eurobond at favorable terms, with proceeds to be used to upgrade power generation and  transportation. Promising commercial prospects of oil discoveries have the potential of providing  significant foreign exchange and fiscal resources. Kenya is actively participating in the  integration of East Africa, showing progress in reducing delays from the port of Mombasa to Kampala  and Kigali. Kenyan banks export their successful business models through East Africa and other  countries in the region, while complying with upgraded prudential regulations. The Central Bank of  Kenya (CBK) maintains proactive financial inclusion policies that have been effective in  facilitating access to credit by small and medium enterprises. Thanks to legal reforms, the  Financial Action Task Force has removed Kenya from its watch list. Recent terrorist attacks and  threats have raised security concerns, especially in coastal areas bordering Somalia. Outlook and policies: Growth is projected to accelerate to 5.8 percent in 2014/15 on the back of  higher public and private investment and measures to improve the business environment. The 2014/15  budget aims at rebalancing recurrent and development spending. Medium-term fiscal policies intend  to bring down the debt burden consistent with the East African Community Monetary Union (EAMU)  Protocol convergence criteria. Inflation remains broadly in check, but rising food prices and rapid  credit growth require careful monitoring by the CBK. Focus: Discussions centered on the implementation of devolution, in particular on the enforcement  of accountability provisions. Some checks and balances are proving effective, such as the required  Treasury approval of guarantees for county borrowing. However, a more systematic framework is  needed. Staff and the authorities agreed that the scale of transfers to counties magnified  government’s cash management problems that need to be addressed with the help of the recently  introduced Treasury Single Account (TSA). This would also contribute to more effective monetary  operations. Discussions also focused on the design of the legal framework for natural resource  management aimed at ensuring consistency with public finance management provisions.","October 2, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Kenya-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-42379,International Monetary Fund.

Focus of consultation: The discussions focused on medium-term policy measures to preserve  macroeconomic stability while promoting inclusive growth, improve transparency and good governance  in the natural resources sector; and foster financial stability and development.

More recently, however, growth has  slowed due to the prolonged downturn in Europe and a sharp deterioration in domestic confidence. A  longer-term decline in the contribution of total factor productivity to growth may also have played  a role. Financial stability risks have increased with the rise in non-performing loans and fall in  bank profitability. The country remains vulnerable to external shocks, given its dependence on  tourism, remittances, and concessional financing. Over the longer term, Cabo Verde’s challenge as a  new middle-income country is to bolster productivity and diversify the sources of growth.  Fiscal consolidation remains critical to safeguard macroeconomic and debt sustainability. Budgetary  plans for 2014 and the medium term entail rising public debt, and are subject to downside risks to  revenue. The authorities have already decided on a package of expenditure containment measures for  2014–17. However, given the high albeit sustainable level of public debt, further measures are  needed to put public debt on a more robust downward path. Bolstering domestic revenue mobilization,  increasing the efficiency of public investment, and managing existing infrastructure better are  also central to sound public finances.  International reserves have recovered, which provided room to ease monetary policy in support of  the recovery. In the absence of imminent pressures on the balance of payments or on prices, and  with private sector credit growth having stalled, the central bank has cut the policy rate. At the  same time, given pressures on the banking system, continued vigilance regarding risks to financial  stability is warranted.  Structural reforms hold the key to bolstering competitiveness, creating jobs, and delivering  inclusive growth. Increasing labor market efficiency and reducing skill mismatches would be  particularly beneficial in this regard. Enhancing the efficiency of state-owned enterprises is also  essential to improve delivery of infrastructure services.

However, the fledgling economic recovery remained insufficient to make a dent  in unemployment and poverty, and fundamental reforms were postponed for fear of derailing the  National Dialogue that was central to the political transition. The macroeconomic situation weakened further since early 2014, with increased sabotage of oil  facilities leading to a decline in oil revenue and, therefore, a deterioration in the fiscal and  external positions and severe fuel and electricity shortages. To address the difficult economic  situation, the authorities have adopted a bold reform agenda to preserve macroeconomic stability  and set the stage for boosting growth, employment creation, and poverty alleviation. They requested  Fund support under an ECF arrangement with access of 150 percent of quota in consideration of the  strength of the reforms and large financing needs. Outlook and Risks: Growth and other macroeconomic indicators are projected to improve steadily over  the medium term as a result of the reform efforts and improvements in security. Institutional  capacity constraints and/or deterioration in security or the political environment could delay  reform implementation, in particular energy subsidy reforms. Such delays could destabilize the  economy and necessitate even stronger adjustments later on. Policy Discussions: Discussions focused mainly on sequencing and speed of reforms in view of the  large financing needs of the budget. Since the successful implementation of the RCF in 2012, there  has been an ongoing dialogue with the authorities and a broad agreement on priority reforms, with  differences of views on the timing and feasibility of the various reforms during the political  transition. After the recent progress achieved in advancing political transition, and the increased  economic challenges, the authorities have decided to move ahead with a strong reform program. The  program aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to more manageable levels and reorient public spending  from generalized subsidies to infrastructure investment and direct social transfers, with the  objective to generate growth and employment and better benefit the poor. The authorities also  agreed with staff on the need to improve fiscal performance by eliminating ghost workers and double dippers from the civil service payroll, and by increasing nonhydrocarbon revenue. Other agreed reforms aim at ensuring financial sector soundness and improving intermediation and the business environment to support growth and  job creation. Other Article IV Issues: An updated debt sustainability analysis indicates that the risk of debt  distress continues to be moderate. Plans to introduce fiscal federalism need to ensure appropriate  expenditure and debt-contracting policies and controls. A gradual increase in exchange rate  flexibility over the medium term would help protect competitiveness and reserves, and would support  growth and job creation.

However, continued  progress could be tested as the country faces a more challenging environment, due to increasing  social and political tensions and frequent strikes in the run-up to the 2015 elections. Moreover,  recent political developments reinforce uncertainties surrounding external budget support. Program: The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility  (ECF) on January 27, 2012, with a total access of SDR 30 million. The first, second, third, and  fourth reviews were completed on July 27, 2012, February 14, 2013, September 6, 2013, and February  28, 2014, respectively. For the fifth review, all end-March performance criteria were observed, but  fiscal revenues underperformed in the first quarter of 2014 requiring corrective fiscal measures  (about 1 percent of GDP on an annual basis). Satisfactory progress has been made on structural  reforms, albeit with some delays. Outlook and risks: The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is challenging. The principal near-term  risk is an intensification of election-related uncertainty, economic disruptions and violence,  which would affect investment and growth. Governance issues or delays in making measurable progress  in public financial management (PFM) reforms, and heightening of political tensions could curtail  donor support.

Saudi Arabia’s economy has grown very strongly in recent years, benefitting from high oil prices and output, strong private sector activity, and government spending. It has  played a systemic and stabilizing role in the global oil market. The economy has not been affected  by the recent global financial market volatility. The Saudi population is young, growing, and  increasingly well educated.  Outlook and risks. The near term economic outlook is positive. Oil production is expected to be  little changed from 2013, while non-oil growth will be underpinned by strong private sector  activity and government spending on large projects in transportation infrastructure and housing.  Inflation is expected to remain subdued. The main source of risk is the global oil market.  Macroeconomic policies. Fiscal buffers are strong at present, providing macroeconomic policies with  scope to respond to shocks. The current path of fiscal policy would, however, lead to a substantial  erosion of these buffers over the medium-term. Fiscal adjustment needs to start to preserve these  buffers and increase saving for intergenerational equity purposes. Monetary and macro-prudential  policy settings are appropriate at present. Reforms to the macroeconomic policy framework can help  strengthen macroeconomic management and create an environment conducive to private investment and  job creation.  Managing demographic pressures. A multi-pronged labor market reform program is increasing the  employment of nationals in the private sector and improving the functioning of the labor market. An  ambitious program to boost the supply of housing is also underway. Energy consumption is high, and  price increases are needed to support efforts to increase energy efficiency and develop public  transportation networks.  Economic diversification. Creating a more diversified economy is a challenge given Saudi Arabia’s  vast oil resources. The government is making considerable efforts to lay the groundwork for further  diversification by upgrading infrastructure, strengthening education and skills, boosting access to  finance for SMEs, and improving the business environment.

Macroeconomic performance has generally exceeded expectations. Real GDP grew 7.3 percent  for 2013, up from 6.3 percent in 2012. Inflation declined to below 5 percent, and the external current account balance has improved. Private credit growth has been  slow, however, a number of financial sector indicators have deteriorated.  Outlook and Risks. Growth is expected to remain robust at 7 percent and inflation to remain in the  mid-single digits. The external current account should improve marginally, allowing for further  accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. Near-term risks appear moderate, although there may be  some bumps in the road from market turbulence and climatic events. Medium-term risks relate to the  potential for tighter external liquidity, the challenge of further fiscal and debt consolidation  while maintaining high levels of investment in infrastructure and human capital, maintaining a  balanced monetary policy, and staying competitive in a shifting economic landscape.  Key Policy Recommendations.  •    Fiscal consolidation and debt reduction need to continue, but the burden of adjustment needs  to shift decisively to revenue generation. Debt targets could potentially be recast to achieve  deeper reduction over a longer period.  •    Monetary policy needs to maintain a balance between supporting growth and containing  inflation. A continued forward-looking approach is needed given long lags in monetary transmission.  •    Financial sector consolidation could lead to economies of scale, greater resilience, and more  effective supervision, but corporate governance needs to continue to improve, and careful  supervision in the post-consolidation period will be key.  •    Maintaining competitiveness and achieving a more sustainable external position will require a  mix of continued innovation, sustained investment in infrastructure and human capital, a  predictable business environment, and ideally a heavier emphasis on direct investment and equity  portfolio flows than debt.","September 18, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Sri-Lanka-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Second-Post-Program-41927,International Monetary Fund.

External risks arise from geopolitical tensions, while  Italy’s high public debt, large public financing needs, and elevated NPLs leave the economy  vulnerable to financial contagion and/or low growth and inflation. Without meaningful reforms,  potential growth is projected to remain low.  Deep structural changes are urgently needed to secure a recovery and unleash Italy’s growth  potential. Moving to a single labor contract with gradually increasing protection would reduce  duality. Judicial efficiency could be improved by promoting mediation and enhancing monitoring of  court performance. Greater efforts to combat corruption would strengthen the business environment.  Implementing reforms simultaneously could be self- reinforcing and generate significant growth  synergies.  A greater push to clean up banks’ bad loans is needed to support lending in the recovery. More  provisioning and write-offs; a private distressed debt market; and enhanced insolvency regime would  accelerate the reduction of NPLs. Improved corporate governance and deeper capital markets would  support growth and financial stability.  A broad strategy to revive the SME sector would complement efforts to strengthen bank balance  sheets. This strategy should promote restructuring support for viable, but distressed firms and a  quick exit for those that are non-viable. A new fiduciary loan contract and greater sharing of  credit information could support alternative financing for new endeavors.  Fiscal policy needs to strike a delicate balance between setting the debt ratio on a downward path  while helping the economy recover. To support growth, the priority should be to lower marginal tax  rates through spending savings and lower tax expenditures. But given the low growth and high  interest rate environment, stronger fiscal balances are needed to bring down debt faster.  Conditional on the recovery taking hold, a modest structural surplus next year would be  appropriate.  Policies at the European level could also support growth by easing further monetary conditions should inflation remain too low, and reducing financial fragmentation.","September 18, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Italy-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41925,International Monetary Fund.

Guatemala’s economy has performed solidly since the 2008–09 crisis. Output has converged  to potential, inflation is under control, and macroeconomic policies remain prudent. However, risks  to the outlook are tilted downwards, while buffers are modest and space for counter-cyclical  policies is thin. Long-term inclusive growth is constrained by low investment in physical and human  capital, institutional weaknesses, and lack of security. Near-term policies are broadly appropriate. With the output gap closed, the broadly neutral fiscal  stance is adequate. The monetary stance is slightly expansionary, but inflation is at the bottom of  the target range. The authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary policy if inflationary  pressures re-emerge. Fiscal sustainability should be enhanced over the medium term. Though the debt-to- GDP ratio  remains moderate, the ability to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies is limited, not least  by Guatemala’s high government debt-to-revenue ratio. Debt stabilization requires moderate  tightening of the budgetary stance over the medium term. The emphasis should be on revenue  mobilization, given the overall low level of spending. Consolidating gains from the 2012 tax  reform, which has so far proved disappointing, will be critical. Efforts to upgrade the monetary and exchange policy framework should continue. Anchoring low and  stable inflation will require measures to bolster monetary policy transmission, including by  expanding exchange rate flexibility. This should provide an additional shock absorber and reduce  incentives for dollarization. It would also establish the inflation target as the undisputed  primary objective of the central bank. Further strengthening of the financial system is necessary. The 2014 FSAP update found that  Guatemala has made significant progress in financial regulation and that the banking system appears  to be generally sound. However, efforts are still needed to improve consolidated supervision and  the regulation of off-shore banks. The time is also ripe for a phased move to Basel III standards. Structural reforms are vital to achieving long-term inclusive growth. Paving the way towards high,  inclusive growth will depend upon raising the low tax-to-GDP ratio to support priority public spending, thereby addressing critical social and developmental needs.","September 18, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Guatemala-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41930,International Monetary Fund.

The economy will remain vulnerable over the medium term, with sluggish real GDP growth, rising public debt and widening external current account deficits. International reserves could decline to uncomfortably low levels. The financial system would continue to be hampered by high NPLs and low capital buffers, especially at a systemic bank. Main fiscal risks include a court decision that could lead to a larger than expected compensation to the former owners of the nationalized companies, weaknesses in a systemic bank, and the cost of the new public bank. Focus of the Consultation. Discussions focused on measures that would place public debt on a sustainable path; address weaknesses in the financial system, particularly in a systemic bank; buttress external sector resilience; and enhance competitiveness and inclusive growth. Key policy advice. ? Improve the primary fiscal balance to about 4.5 percent of GDP starting in 2015. This could be achieved mainly by allowing spending on goods and services to rise only in line with inflation; containing the expansion in the wage bill; requiring public workers to contribute to their pensions; and by widening the tax base and strengthening revenue administration. Active debt management, including refinancing of expensive debt with low-earning deposits (essentially from PetroCaribe), would support these efforts. ? Address banking sector vulnerabilities through improving capital buffers. ? Improve public financial management (PFM) to contain low-quality spending, strengthen budget formulation, preparation, and execution, and improve the coverage and accuracy of budget documents. ? Further improve the business environment to attract more private investment, boost competitiveness, and enhance job-creating and inclusive growth. Implementation of staff advice. Implementation of recent staff advice is mixed. The breathing room provided by the debt restructuring was not used to improve the primary fiscal balance.

Focus of consultation: Discussions focused on mitigating the main risks to the macroeconomic  framework and, inter alia, policies to return to structural fiscal surpluses over the medium term,  and to support economic diversification and inclusive growth, the modernization of the monetary  policy framework, and financial stability. Key policy recommendations: •    Return to structural fiscal surpluses in line with the objective set forth in Angola’s  Sovereign Wealth Fund, by mobilizing additional nonoil tax revenue, improving the efficiency of  public investment, and reducing current spending, including by phasing out the costly and  regressive fuel subsidies—while mitigating the impact on the poor through well-targeted social  assistance. •    Adopt an improved medium-term fiscal framework, focusing on the structural fiscal balance to  limit the impact of the oil sector on the nonoil economy. •    Develop a coherent asset-liability management framework, including a well-designed stabilization fund to shield the budget from oil revenue fluctuations. •    Further improve public financial management systems to avoid, inter alia, a recurrence in the  future of domestic payments arrears. •    Continue improving the business climate to boost economic development, diversification, and  competitiveness. • In transitioning over the medium-term toward an inflation targeting regime, enhance the central  bank’s capacity to collect and analyze high-frequency economic data, and continue de-dollarizing  the economy. •    Further strengthen the financial system, by continuing to improve the transparency and  accountability of banks, and enhancing bank supervision. •    Manage public guarantees transparently and with a view to minimize fiscal costs, as envisaged  in the recently-approved law on public guarantees.","September 5, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Angola-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41892,International Monetary Fund.

Growth has been strong, inflation low, and fiscal buffers and international  reserves adequate. However, poverty and unemployment remain high, despite large government spending  financed from oil revenue. The business climate is among the most challenging and the private  credit-to-GDP ratio among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  Outlook and Risks. The economy is projected to expand by about 6 percent per annum between 2014 and  2019, as new oil fields come on stream and an ambitious public investment program is implemented to  diversify the economy and make growth more inclusive. Oil production is expected to peak in 2017.  The medium-term outlook for non-oil growth and poverty reduction hinges on progress addressing  deep-seated structural weaknesses and fiscal adjustment. Risks to the outlook relate to oil price  volatility and political instability.  Policies. Macroeconomic policies should focus on meeting the economy’s social and development needs  while mitigating risks to macroeconomic stability in the longer term. •    The growth of government spending should be arrested and the 2014 budget  should not be  exceeded. Amid spending pressures related to the 2015 Africa Games and the 2016 presidential  elections, new fiscal developments should be reflected in a supplementary budget in 2014 to enhance  transparency. •    In view of the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves, a gradual fiscal consolidation  should be targeted over the medium-term to safeguard fiscal and debt  sustainability. Ongoing  efforts to address implementation and absorptive capacity constraints need to be stepped up to  maximize the benefits from public investments. •    Consideration should be given to adopt the non-oil primary balance as the fiscal anchor. • The private sector’s supply response to public infrastructure spending should be maximized  through implementation of reforms to improve the business climate, support private investment, and  develop the financial sector. •    The pilot project for cash transfers should be well-targeted and monitored to reduce poverty. •    Compliance with reserves pooling requirements would insure the continued smooth operation of  the BEAC and the exchange rate peg, which both continue to serve the Republic of Congo well.","September 4, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Republic-of-Congo-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41888,International Monetary Fund.

Supply-side slowdowns in the energy  sector are ending, while available evidence suggests non-energy growth is robust and economic slack  is being used up. Non-energy growth should settle around a long-term 2–2½ percent per annum rate,  while new energy sector investment may begin to bear significant fruit over the medium term.  Headline inflation is trending down (in part for statistical reasons), while core inflation remains  moderate. Domestic risks are to the upside. The main medium-term external risk would be a sustained  decline in energy prices. With excess capacity in the labor market significantly diminished, the time is drawing near for  policy tightening. Although ad hoc measures will reduce the budget deficit this fiscal year, the  underlying baseline suggests a growing overall imbalance and unsustainable debt accumulation on  unchanged policies, although the authorities have announced their intention to pursue fiscal  consolidation. The CBTT will have to carefully consider how to tighten the monetary stance given  high excess bank liquidity. Sustainable growth requires re-configuring fiscal policy, although achieving this will be  challenging for the time being in view of national elections due in 2015. Ad hoc measures should be  replaced with policies that durably improve non energy-based revenues and spending. The proceeds  from extracting non-renewable resources should be saved and invested as a stepping stone to lasting  prosperity. Fuel subsidies need to be curtailed and social programs rationalized. Non-energy sector  tax bases should be broadened and tax expenditures limited. Greater flexibility is needed in the foreign exchange market. Despite sizable reserves, foreign  exchange shortages, which impose unnecessary economic costs, have recurred. There is no concrete  evidence of either a parallel market or arrears on foreign exchange, and the CBTT has recently sold  foreign exchange with the objective to clear the market, but a recurrence of the situation could  indicate the existence of an exchange restriction. The CBTT can address the problem through  increased flexibility in the foreign exchange system. Structural reforms are underway, but more are needed to foster a diversified economic base.  Financial sector reform is advancing, including expanding the CBTT’s regulatory perimeter to  systemically important non-bank financial institutions. Recent streamlining of regulations that  have hampered business activity is welcomed, but needs to be further advanced. Government  operations are increasingly hamstrung by a poorly functioning civil service. Perceptions of  corruption can be reduced by adopting a transparent procurement process. Programs that mask  underemployment should be replaced with more effective training.

But it remains large. Curaçao’s growth and job creation remain lackluster,  due to weak competitiveness, adverse sectoral trends (e.g., in the international financial center),  red tape, and rigid labor laws. Sint Maarten’s tourism-based economy is recovering but remains vulnerable to shocks and suffers from weak  administrative capacity—as underscored, for example, by weakening tax collection.  Risks: Both Curaçao and, especially, Sint Maarten are exposed to shifts in tourism demand. Curaçao  is vulnerable to the uncertain situation in Venezuela, its main trading partner. If long-discussed  flexibility- and competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms are not implemented, both countries’  capacity to absorb shocks may prove limited, and pressures on FX reserves and, ultimately, the peg  may intensify.  Policy recommendations: Fiscal policies should entrench recent gains to facilitate continued  external adjustment (especially in Curaçao) and build buffers against shocks. Curaçao should extend  the reform of its pension system to public sector workers, further streamline its administrative  apparatus, and address weak governance and finances in state companies. Sint Maarten needs to  increase revenues to support an expanding administration, including through stronger tax collection  and greater contribution from its profitable state companies. The common central bank must monitor  closely the deterioration in banks’ loan portfolios and refrain from direct financing of  non-financial companies.

Expansionary fiscal policies—largely to counteract the impact of the global slowdown and  the two successive natural disasters—led to a deterioration in fiscal balances, with public debt up  by about 10½ percent of GDP over this period. The fiscal deficit, however, is expected to narrow  this year, largely reflecting cuts in capital spending. In the financial sector, non performing  loans remain above prudential guidelines; provisioning and profitability are low; and supervision  remains weak.  Policy Challenges: Further fiscal consolidation—including by rebalancing government expenditure  toward growth and employment generating public sector projects—is required to ensure medium-term  sustained growth as well as keep public sector debt on a downward trajectory. In this regard,  improving the efficiency of revenue collection and reducing current spending—especially on the wage  bill, which is high relative to revenues—will be crucial to allow the government to maneuver fiscal  policy.

Growth remains rapid, but has moderated from the 7¼ percent recorded in 2013. Remittances and accommodative monetary and financial conditions remain the primary growth drivers, despite volatile capital flows, slowing activity in the region and severe natural disasters. Inflation has picked up to over 4 percent, while the current account remains in surplus. Local financial markets were moderately impacted by the Fed’s “taper talk and action,” weakening the peso and equity prices. Credit growth has quickened, especially to construction. Potential growth has risen to about 6?6¼ percent. However, persistent weakness in the business climate is a risk to sustained growth and hinders job creation. Foreign ownership restrictions, inadequate infrastructure and high doing-business costs have held back overall investment and employment. Along with frequent natural disasters, this has kept poverty elevated, thereby sustaining outward migration. Outlook and risks. Normalizing financial conditions are forecast to ease growth to 6?6½ percent over the medium term, while keeping inflation within the band and moderating the current account surplus. Abrupt changes in global financial conditions and a sharp growth slowdown in EMs are among the external growth risks. On the domestic front, excessive flow of real and financial resources to the property sector could increase volatility of asset prices and GDP growth over the longer run. Policy recommendations. A more restrictive policy stance is needed to preserve macro- financial stability, with rebalancing of the mix to allow higher public investment spending, while implementing reforms to sustain vibrant growth and make it more inclusive: • Absorbing liquidity and raising official interest rates would address second-round inflation effects and potential overheating and financial stability risks. Allowing the exchange rate to adjust more fully to structural inflows, while smoothing the effect of cyclical flows, would limit further sustained reserve buildup. • Addressing specific risks from real estate and large credit exposures requires further targeted measures and broadening the BSP’s mandate to include financial stability. This would help prevent diversion of systemic risk to shadow banking and strengthen tools to manage risks from deepening cross-border financial integration. • Raising the fiscal deficit from below 1½ percent of GDP in 2013 to 2 percent of GDP in 2014 to accommodate reconstruction spending should be accompanied by tighter monetary and financial conditions.

The   outlook for tourism is also improving. The reconstruction from a recent cyclone is expected to lead   to both a temporary boost to growth and additional financing needs.  Risks to the inflation outlook and the external position are low.    Fiscal Policy: The projected fiscal cost relating to the cyclone will be largely met by confirmed   funding mainly from donor agencies. In the near term, the authorities should focus on   reconstruction activities, while a medium-term fiscal strategy should aim at gradually stabilizing   and then reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio, in order to improve Tonga’s moderate risk of debt   distress. This will require careful execution of investments related to the 2019 South Pacific   Games.    Monetary Policy: The deleveraging cycle of the Tongan banks appears to be ending, and thus National   Reserve Bank of Tonga should prepare to gradually withdraw liquidity and tighten monetary   conditions once the current signs of a recovery of credit growth are confirmed. The authorities   plan to lower the cost of credit through supportive credit policies, including by commercializing   the Tonga Development Bank. The successful implementation of such plan requires sound safeguards,   including a robust governance structure and firm risk management and accountability frameworks.    Structural Policy: Structural reforms to facilitate the functioning of credit markets need to be   implemented with renewed vigor. The authorities’ intention to gradually phase out existing ad hoc   tax incentives is well placed. The promotion of foreign direct investments should focus on   business-enabling structural reforms, while the use of tax incentives should  be minimized and well targeted.","August 6, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Tonga-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41816,International Monetary Fund.

This year, the economy is slowing down, in large part because of weaker domestic and  external demand, and regional tensions. Inflation is expected to accelerate temporarily due to the  devaluation of the tenge (February 2014). Enhancing the policy architecture and promoting a  business environment unencumbered by the state remain key challenges for Kazakhstan to become a  dynamic emerging market economy and ensure durable and balanced long-term growth. The recent  reappointment of Prime Minister Massimov was accompanied by the authorities’ commitment to speeding  up structural reforms. In this context, the government is strengthening its links with the  multilateral development banks (MDBs). The May 29 signing of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), with Russia and Belarus, is not expected to have  near-term economic effects; medium-term effects will depend on how the Union’s rules and  regulations will be implemented.  Focus of consultation and key recommendations: Amid uncertain external and domestic environments,  the consultation focused on policy measures to mitigate shocks and achieve the authorities’ short-  and medium-term objectives, in particular: (i) restoring confidence and stability in the post-devaluation environment; (ii) resolving the  nonperforming loans (NPL) problem, in line with the recent FSAP recommendations; (iii) bolstering the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, as recommended last year; and (iv) accelerating structural reforms, including the implementation of industrialization and  diversification policies carefully and transparently.  Previous consultation: During the 2013 Article IV Consultation, Directors encouraged the  authorities to take advantage of the positive outlook to strengthen the macroeconomic policy  architecture, including by (i) showing greater determination to addressing the high level of NPLs;  (ii) following through on the planned introduction of a new policy interest rate to enhance the  transmission mechanism of monetary policy; and (iii) revamping the medium-term fiscal framework through improved coverage and transparency. Since  then, the authorities have been more resolute in dealing with the NPL problem.

Inflation has risen, a consumption tax increase has been   implemented, and there are signs of a transition to private-led growth. However, structural reforms   have progressed slowly and a medium-term fiscal plan beyond 2015 is still to be articulated.   Uncertainty is therefore high whether the recovery and exit from deflation will become                 self sustained under current policies.  More forceful growth reforms are needed to overcome structural headwinds to raising growth and   ending deflation The next round of structural reforms should lift labor supply, reduce labor market   duality, enhance risk capital provision, and accelerate agricultural and services sector   deregulation. Corporate governance reforms already underway could help reduce firms’ preference for   large cash holdings.  A concrete medium-term fiscal reform plan is urgently needed. Given very high levels of public   debt, implementation of the second consumption tax increase is critical to establish a track record   of fiscal discipline. Adoption of a concrete medium-term fiscal consolidation plan  beyond 2015 would build confidence in the sustainability of public finances and allow more   flexibility to respond to downside risks. Plans to lower the corporate tax rate have growth   benefits, but should proceed in combination with measures to offset revenue losses and be   consistent with plans to restore fiscal sustainability.  Monetary policy is appropriately accommodative. With inflation and inflation expectations   increasing, no further easing is needed at this point. In case downside risks to the inflation   outlook materialize, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should act swiftly through further and/or longer-   dated asset purchases. Communication should focus on achieving 2 percent inflation in a stable   manner aided by a more transparent presentation of the BoJ’s forecast and underlying assumptions.  The financial sector remains stable. Portfolio rebalancing by financial institutions and investors     is desirable but also raises new risks, including from greater overseas engagement. In regional   banks, limited growth opportunities and low net interest margins could further undermine core   profitability and weaken capital buffers. Supervisors should continue to be proactive in monitoring   these risks.  Japan’s external position is assessed as broadly in balance—compared to moderately undervalued last   year—because of structural changes in the external sector, including from the offshoring of   production and sustained high energy imports, which have become more apparent.  Launching all three arrows will create benefits for the region and the global economy. Spillovers   via the trade channel and capital flows are expected to increase in coming years with uncertain net   effects—higher exports and capital outflows—in the short term. As long as Japan continues to   proceed with its reforms, incomes will rise and fiscal risks decline, which will be  positive for the global economy.","July 31, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Japan-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41800,International Monetary Fund.

The refugee influx has reached   one quarter of the population, fueling already high unemployment and poverty. The political impasse   from the presidential elections—following months of negotiations over a new government—adds to the   uncertainty. The economy is meanwhile suffering from a broad-based deterioration, with subdued   growth and widening fiscal imbalances. Public debt is on the rise. Progress on structural reforms   has been limited. On the positive side, deposit inflows have held up and foreign exchange reserves   are sizeable; and security conditions have significantly improved, lifting tourism prospects.  Key challenges: There is an urgent need for fiscal adjustment to achieve a sustainable debt   reduction, and structural reforms to boost growth and address social inequities.  Key policy recommendations:  •        Fiscal policy. The immediate priority is to stop the fiscal deterioration and return to   primary surpluses, to avoid a possible loss of market confidence and put debt on a sustainable   path. The consolidation strategy should minimize the impact of a planned salary increase for the   public sector; include broad-based and non- distortionary revenue measures; and rebalance   expenditure away from electricity transfers toward capital and social spending, to promote   inclusive growth. Passing a budget for 2014 would help anchor confidence. Fiscal management should   be strengthened and anchored in a medium-term perspective.  •        Monetary policy. The Banque du Liban (BdL) should continue to maintain high foreign   exchange reserves as a buffer and signal of commitment to macro-financial stability. It should   gradually withdraw from T-bill auctions, and adopt a strategy to improve its balance sheet over   time.  •        Financial sector. Capital buffers should be strengthened, and the loan classification and   restructuring rules and the AML/CFT regime further enhanced.  •        Structural reforms. Reforms in the electricity sector and the labor market are imperative   to address current competitiveness pressures, lay the foundations for higher-productivity growth,   and improve social conditions.  •        Refugee crisis. Lebanon cannot shoulder the costs of the massive inflow of Syrian refugees   alone, and international budget support is needed. Strong government commitment to adjustment and   reforms—along with a concerted policy framework to deal with the refugee crisis—would bolster   credibility and help mobilize support.","July 31, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Lebanon-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41801,International Monetary Fund.

After three decades of remarkable growth, the economy has been slowing. Much of the slowdown has been structural, reflecting the natural convergence process and waning dividends from  past reforms; weak global growth has also contributed. Moreover, since the global financial crisis,  growth has relied too much on investment and credit, which is not sustainable and has created  rising vulnerabilities. Growth was 7.7 percent in 2013, and is expected to slow to around 7½  percent this year and decline further over the medium term. Focus. The pattern of growth since the global financial crisis is not sustainable and has resulted  in rising vulnerabilities. The discussions focused on assessing the risks posed by the continued build-up of vulnerabilities; reforms to unleash new, sustainable engines of growth and reduce  vulnerabilities; and how to best manage aggregate demand in this context, as growth is slowing yet  risks are still rising. A key takeaway is that to secure a safer development path, accommodative  policies need to be carefully unwound, accompanied by decisive implementation of the announced  reform agenda to promote rebalancing. The result will be somewhat slower but safer growth in the  near term, with the significant long-run benefit of securing more inclusive, environment-friendly,  and sustainable growth. Risks. Credit and ‘shadow banking,’ local government finances, and the corporate sector—  particularly real estate—are the key, and interlinked, areas of rising vulnerability. In the near  term, the risk of a hard landing is still considered low as the government has the capacity to  combat potential shocks. However, without a change in the pattern of growth, the hard-landing risk  continues to rise and is assessed to be medium-likely over the medium term.  Reform agenda. The authorities have announced a comprehensive and ambitious blueprint of reforms.  Successful implementation should achieve the desired transformation of the economy, but will also  be challenging.  Demand management. Reining in credit growth, local government borrowing, and investment will  address the risks, but also slow growth. Macro support should be calibrated to allow needed  adjustments to take place, while preventing growth from slowing too much. Scenarios and spillovers. With faster adjustment and reform implementation, growth will be somewhat  lower in the near term, with moderate spillovers for trading partners. However, in the medium term,  income and consumption will both be higher—a result that is good for China and good for the global  economy.","July 30, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Peoples-Republic-of-China-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41799,International Monetary Fund.

Headwinds that  previously held back the economy—relating notably to credit conditions and  confidence—have eased. Nonetheless, sustaining strong growth will depend on a  recovery in productivity growth and further demand rebalancing. The housing market  brings risks of financial vulnerabilities. Sterling is moderately overvalued.  The overall policy mix is appropriate, but policy settings might need to be adjusted  quickly. Effective monetary conditions are very supportive, compensating for ongoing  fiscal consolidation:  ? Accommodative monetary policy is appropriate for now, given weak inflation  pressures, but policy might need to be adjusted quickly if inflation takes off. Interest  rate increases may also need to be considered if macroprudential tools are  insufficient to deal with financial stability risks from the housing market.  ? The authorities have recently implemented macroprudential measures, including  limiting the share of high loan-to-income mortgages lenders can issue, establishing  them as the primary defense against housing-related risks. They should stand ready  to tighten these limits should current settings prove ineffective in reining in those  risks.  ? A lasting solution to house price pressures requires measures to address insufficient  supply. Significant planning reforms have been undertaken, but political consensus is  needed to make further progress in this area.  ? High deficits and rising debt mean that fiscal consolidation needs to continue. The  pace and composition of deficit reduction over the near term is appropriate. Further  reducing the deficit over the medium term will be challenging; both revenue and  expenditure measures should be considered, keeping in mind both equity and  efficiency.  ? The financial sector is more robust, the new financial architecture is settling in, and  significant changes have been made to banks’ liquidity backstops to adapt to  changing needs. Implementing macroprudential policy will be a test of the new  architecture.

Discussions took place for the first time since the handover of Macao SAR from Portugal to   China in 1999. Prudent macroeconomic management has underpinned rapid development in the territory,   which is now the world’s largest gaming center. As a small, open and tourism-dependent economy,   Macao SAR is currently also benefiting from loose global monetary conditions and a Mainland-related   boom.    Outlook and risks. Growth should stay strong over the next few years at 8–10 percent buoyed by   gaming exports and investment, with inflation remaining around 5–5½ percent. However, the economy   is vulnerable to external shocks, in particular a slowdown in tourism, due to shocks in the   Mainland or Hong Kong SAR or other setbacks to the global recovery. The buoyant property market   could also correct if demand fundamentals shift or interest rates rise abruptly with the withdrawal   of unconventional monetary policy abroad.    Macroeconomic policies. The policy stance is appropriate, with scope for further tightening of   macroprudential policies should property prices continue to rise sharply. If downside risks   materialize, targeted fiscal stimulus should be used to buttress growth. In the event of a severe   property downturn, some countervailing measures could be cautiously unwound. The currency board is   the best arrangement for Macao SAR.    Financial stability. Important progress has been made in strengthening financial stability in line   with the 2011 FSAP recommendations. Prudential measures should focus on managing potential credit   and liquidity risks from a gaming slowdown and the property sector, as well as spillovers from   shocks in the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR.    Longer term challenges. Looking further ahead, Macao SAR’s public finances face a moderation in   gaming revenues juxtaposed against spending needs from population aging. A sovereign wealth fund to   manage part of the territory’s fiscal reserves and medium-term budgeting could therefore be useful.

The 2014 Article IV Consultation focused on five broad themes to strengthen the recovery and improve the long-term outlook: raising productivity growth and labor force  participation, confronting poverty, keeping public debt on a sustained downward path, smoothly  managing the exit from zero policy rates, and securing a safer financial system.  Main policy issues. •    Policies are needed to boost longer-term potential output through investments in  infrastructure, raising educational outcomes, improving the tax structure, and developing and  expanding a skilled labor force (including through immigration reform, job training, and providing  childcare assistance for working families). •     Forging agreement on a credible, medium-term consolidation plan should be a high priority and  include steps to lower the growth of health care costs, reform social security, and increase  revenues. In the absence of such a comprehensive agreement, efforts should still focus on  identifying more modest opportunities to relax the near- term budget envelope, paid for with future  fiscal savings. •    An enduring consequence of the past recession has been a jump in the number of families living  in poverty. Improved employment prospects and economic growth will be essential to reverse this  upward movement. An expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and an increase in the minimum wage  should also be part of the solution. •    The goal for monetary policy is to manage the exit from zero interest rates in a manner that  allows the economy to converge to full employment with stable prices while avoiding financial  instability and negative spillovers to the global economy. This is a complex undertaking. To  facilitate it, steps could be taken to expand the Fed’s communications toolkit so as to provide  greater clarity on how the Federal Open Market Committee assesses progress toward its longer-run  goals. •     Continued regulatory oversight is needed to counter the emergence of financial imbalances,  particularly those that may be growing outside of the banking system. Policies should also be  deployed to keep mortgage credit accessible and attract more private capital into housing finance  while minimizing risks to taxpayers.  •     The U.S. external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.","July 23, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/United-States-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41777,International Monetary Fund.

Growth modestly recovered, and   international reserves rebounded. Swaziland’s challenges, however, remain significant, in view of   its high vulnerability to exogenous shocks and its sluggish growth performance, while facing   significant social and development challenges with high unemployment and the prevalence of   HIV/AIDS. Swaziland now stands at a critical juncture to strengthen its resilience to exogenous   shocks, address its weak growth performance, and meet critical social and development needs.  Outlook and risks: Under the status-quo policies, the outlook is for continued sluggish growth and   increasing fiscal and external imbalances, reflecting low private investment, elevated government   spending, and prospective decline in SACU revenues. Risks are associated with the high volatility   of the SACU revenues, possible negative spillovers from South Africa (including higher policy rate   and lower growth), and uncertain prospects for preferential trade agreements with the U.S. and EU.  Strengthening Resilience to Shocks: Over the medium term, international reserves should be targeted   at five to seven months of imports, and public debt be kept below 30 percent of GDP. This calls for   a prudent fiscal policy stance, with fiscal deficit below 2 percent of GDP.  Raising growth: It is essential to enhance the efficiency of the public sector and promote private   sector-led growth through structural reforms including improving business climate and accelerating   land reforms.  Maintaining financial stability: Financial soundness indicators are generally strong. The strong   growth of the nonbank financial sector in recent years calls for strengthening of supervision and   regulation for the sector.  Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on macroeconomic policy   and structural reform priorities.

Room for further monetary easing has narrowed but space remains if domestic demand flounders, so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored. On fiscal, given the strong public finances, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate unimpeded and there is space for stimuli in the event of a major downturn. The commitment to close the structural fiscal deficit by 2018 is appropriate and should be phased in a way that avoids undue drag on the recovery.

Growth estimates for 2013 and projections   for 2014 were revised to 6.6 and 6.8 percent, respectively, reflecting weather and weaker terms of   trade. Inflation is around zero, partly due to subsidized food prices. The revised 2013 current   account deficit rose to 7 percent of GDP, with a drawdown of imputed reserves. The 2013 fiscal   deficit increased to 3.5 percent of GDP, reflecting weaker revenues and spending for subsidies,   partly offset by higher grants.    In line with 2011 Article IV recommendations, the authorities maintained a prudent fiscal stance,   despite numerous shocks, and implemented structural reforms that have improved the resilience of   agriculture, especially cotton. Social transfers have been bolstered to ensure the benefits of   growth are better distributed. An updated external stability analysis shows that the exchange rate   is broadly in line with fundamentals, and an updated joint debt sustainability analysis maintains a   “moderate” risk of debt distress.    Program performance has been satisfactory. The authorities are requesting a waiver for a   non-observance in the performance criterion for net domestic financing at end-December 2013, with   most other quantitative targets met and all structural benchmarks for end-January and end-March   met. Program targets differ mainly due to higher budget support projections. The 3 percent fiscal   deficit target for the medium term macroeconomic framework remains unchanged, although with a   higher share of current spending.    Policy discussions focused on composition and quality of spending, transfers to public enterprises,   and natural resource revenues. The authorities recently submitted a supplemental budget that   increases the share of current spending for a higher wage bill and more social and public   enterprise transfers, but remains within program targets as a result of spending offsets and higher   budget support. The authorities are proposing an audit of large public enterprises to estimate   needs for the medium term, and inform reforms to reduce transfer needs. The National Assembly did   not approve a new mining taxation code by  end-2013 as expected, rather, the draft code was sent back to the authorities for further  consideration of investors’ concerns.","July 21, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Burkina-Faso-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-First-Review-Under-the-Three-41765,International Monetary Fund.

Germany fundamentals are sound: balance sheets are generally healthy, unemployment is at a historic low, and the fiscal position is strong. ?

Germany could do more to increase its growth, thus strengthening its role as an engine of euro area recovery. Policy recommendations: ? Germany has the fiscal space to finance an increase in needed public investment, particularly in the transport infrastructure. Unlike public consumption, this would durably raise German output and have measurable growth spillovers on the rest of the euro area. ? Further reforms in services sector regulation would boost competition and productivity. ? Greater clarity about the future energy sector regulatory framework would encourage private investment in the energy infrastructure and beyond and strengthen the outlook. ?

Macroeconomic situation and outlook: Nepal’s macroeconomic situation remains broadly favorable.  Growth is projected to recover in 2013/14 owing to good monsoons, robust growth in services, and  increased public spending. Inflation is moderating, in line with developments in India. High  remittance inflows are supporting a strong external position, as well as high reserve money growth.  Risks to the outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, involving slower-than-expected growth in  countries hosting Nepali workers and domestic financial sector risks. Medium term prospects: While remittances are expected to continue to support the external position,  the outlook for growth depends on improving the environment for private investment. This requires a  decisive boost in public capital spending, and structural reforms in key areas. Financial sector: Despite progress, significant vulnerabilities remain. The recent assessment under  the FSAP, Nepal’s first, raised concerns about asset quality and interconnectedness, as well as  financial sector infrastructure—including the legal framework—and supervision and crisis  preparedness. At the same time, a largely unsupervised cooperatives sector is growing rapidly. Key policy recommendations: Monetary policy should aim at controlling the volatility and level of  excess reserves in the financial system, implying a modest tightening of monetary conditions. The  exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee provides a useful nominal anchor for the economy, and the  real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Capital spending needs to be boosted to  provide key infrastructure, and reforms implemented to support private investment, which will help  generate sustained economic growth and employment opportunities. In the financial sector, further  reforms to bolster regulation and supervision, and improve financial infrastructure are needed to  reduce risk and increase access to finance.","July 18, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Nepal-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41761,International Monetary Fund.

Cameroon’s macroeconomic outlook and risks have deteriorated slightly since the Article IV consultation in 2013. Economic activity has remained strong and inflation subdued,  but the fiscal position has worsened; public debt has been rising at a less sustainable pace;  government deposits have dwindled; and payment delays have continued. The anticipated growth path  may not suffice to reach upper-middle-income country status by 2035.  Focus of the consultation and risks. The overarching policy issue remains unchanged: how to set  Cameroon on a higher growth path, while mitigating low but growing risks to macroeconomic  stability. Spillovers from regional insecurity have become the main exogenous risk; endogenous  risks stem from rising contingent liabilities and credit concentration. Past policy advice remains  relevant.  Key policy recommendations:  •    Strengthen cash management and expenditure controls to prevent a further accumulation of  payment deferrals. •     Close the financing gap in 2014, and adopt a downward path for the non-oil primary deficit to  rebuild fiscal space and preserve macroeconomic stability. •    Improve non-oil revenue by broadening the tax base and streamlining tax exemptions. •    Reprioritize public expenditure by reducing fuel subsidies gradually; provide targeted  compensation measures for the most vulnerable. •    Increase the selectivity of investment projects and adopt a rigorous screening of the  financing terms to ensure debt sustainability. •    Pursue the resolution of three small distressed banks and support the strengthening of  regional bank and microfinance supervision. •    Promote higher and more inclusive growth through better targeted educational and social spending, a propitious business climate, and deeper regional integration.","July 17, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Cameroon-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41759,International Monetary Fund.

However, as in many other small middle-income  countries (SMICs) in the region, trend growth has softened in recent years, reflecting the decline  in the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) to growth which calls for policies to reduce  structural bottlenecks in the economy. Current conditions and outlook: Botswana’s economy remains broadly internally and externally  balanced and the authorities’ near-term macroeconomic policy mix is appropriate. Output growth is  expected to slowdown in 2014 reflecting partly weaknesses in the non-mineral sector, while  inflation is expected to remain within the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) medium-term objective range of  3-6 percent. Fiscal policy: Staff supports the FY2014/15 budget, which reins in unproductive current spending,  while protecting growth-promoting capital spending. Achieving medium-term fiscal consolidation  objectives adopted in the budget, would require articulating concrete measures to reduce the wage  bill relative to GDP and broaden the revenue base. Financial sector development: Botswana’s banking system is well-capitalized and profitable with  relatively low nonperforming loans. Although from a low base, credit growth to households continues  to expand at a high rate, which poses potential vulnerabilities for the financial sector. Thus,  staff recommends that macro prudential measures be considered to temper the rate of growth of  household borrowing. In this context, staff welcomes the government’s emphasis on enhancing greater  financial deepening and inclusion, while preserving the stability of the financial system. Reinvigorating growth: Returning to an era of strong growth and accelerating Botswana’s convergence  to higher income levels would require policies to reinvigorate TFP growth. These include improving  the quality of public spending, notably in public investment projects and education to ensure the  transformation of diamond wealth into sustainable assets. The authorities’ efforts to improve the  country’s competitiveness, including through reducing the regulatory burden on firms, is also  welcomed. Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on the macroeconomic  policy stance and structural reform policy priorities. Consistent with staff’s advice, the FY  2014/15 budget outlined a framework to reduce the burden of loss- making state-owned enterprises on  fiscal resources and propel them toward commercial viability. Furthermore, the budget includes  medium-term projections of government accounts, as recommended by staff during past consultations.  However, progress towards reducing the wage bill relative to GDP remains modest.","July 15, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Botswana-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41749,International Monetary Fund.

Real GDP growth is projected to converge to potential (about 4½ percent) in 2014, with inflation remaining within the 2–4 percent target range. The medium-term  outlook is favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside. Colombia’s important and growing ties  with the global economy expose the economy to external risks.

The significant fiscal consolidation envisaged by the authorities will help stabilize Kiribati’s  sovereign wealth fund (the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, or RERF) in real per capita terms.  This stabilization effort would also require that fishing license fees remain close to recent  exceptionally high levels, with windfall incomes relative to the conservative budgeted baseline  saved. In the event of weaker fishing license fee revenues, a more ambitious adjustment in the  non-fishing budget would be needed.  The small private sector share in the economy due to remoteness and weaknesses in business climate  constrains growth and puts strain on public finances. Continuing the fiscal and structural reform  program is essential. Climate change brings additional risks and fiscal costs.  Main Recommendations: •    Continue fiscal reforms designed to deliver fiscal consolidation and improved public financial  management. Seek to maintain fishing license fees above the current conservative budget baseline,  with windfalls saved to strengthen RERF balances. If fishing license fee windfalls cannot be  sustained, explore other options to further strengthen fiscal balances. •    Continue reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). •    Facilitate growth through improving the business climate and infrastructure, including through  streamlining government services.","May 27, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Kiribati-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41583,International Monetary Fund.

Over the past decade, Afghanistan has made enormous progress in reconstruction,  development and lifting per capita income. Security and political uncertainties, and weak  institutions have constrained growth and weighed on social outcomes. With significant reform  efforts and donor support, Afghanistan has maintained macroeconomic stability, implemented  important structural reforms, and built policy buffers, but significant vulnerabilities remain. The  IMF has been supporting Afghanistan through technical assistance and a three-year Extended Credit  Facility (ECF) arrangement. Reviews under the ECF arrangement have been delayed.  Outlook and risks. 2014 is a crucial year in the political and security transitions and the run-up  to the “transformation decade” (2015–24). Assuming smooth political and security transitions,  continued reform and donor financing, the outlook should be positive. Large security and  development expenditure needs and a limited domestic revenue capacity mean that Afghanistan will  remain dependent on donor financing for an extended period. Macroeconomic stability, structural  reforms, and political and security stability are needed to ensure inclusive growth. Risks, mostly  on the downside, are related to adverse domestic or regional security developments, political  instability, inadequate implementation of economic policies, and donor fatigue.  Policy recommendations. The authorities’ economic strategy (maintaining macroeconomic stability,  strengthening the financial sector, improving economic governance, and moving toward fiscal  sustainability) remains appropriate and needs strengthened implementation. Sustained implementation  of this strategy will safeguard growth and build buffers to help manage shocks. Policies should  continue to aim at strengthening revenue collection, managing money growth to control inflation  while preserving exchange rate flexibility, strengthening bank supervision, and quickly enacting  anti-money laundering (AML), countering financing of terrorism (CFT), banking, central bank, and value-added tax legislation.","May 21, 2014",http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Islamic-Republic-of-Afghanistan-Staff-Report-for-the-2014-Article-IV-Consultation-41571,International Monetary Fund.
