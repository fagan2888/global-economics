The program remains fully financed All financing needs are covered for the next 12 months based on external and domestic operations. The authorities have successfully re-profiled about US$400 million in 2015, extending the average maturity of domestic debt from 3.3 to 4.3 years. The domestic financial system, especially pension funds, currently possess ample liquidity to support the financing plans. The authorities remain open to the possibility of tapping international capital markets to undertake liability management operations to smooth debt service. Their extended investment plan will require about US$750 million for 2016–17 in external financing which they plan to obtain mainly from multilateral institutions, with most new debt contracted to be allocated to infrastructure and social spending (Table 4).

Summary Table of Projected External Borrowing Program Sources: Ministry of Finance, Honduras mm dg Y PP V V Page 29 Capacity to repay the fund remains adequate and the balance of risks is manageable Honduras’ capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate. Potential access under the program would have only a modest effect on external debt (29 percent of GDP at end-2015), and the risk of debt distress is considered moderate according to the latest debt sustainability analysis. The debt sustainability analysis shows improved prospects relative to the previous review (Annex I). The medium-term fiscal projections show a declining path in the public debt over GDP ratio, a significant improvement relative to the recent past. These projections are consistent with the parameters of the FRL and reflect the stronger macroeconomic policies underpinned by structural reforms that have been adopted. While the risk of external debt distress remains as moderate, proper implementation of fiscal and monetary reforms will be key to move the risk assessment to a low distress rating. The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment.
