Inflation (YOY percent change) Economic activity appears to have recovered in 2015, while inflation has trended down. Following a 0.2 percent contraction in 2014, including in the aftermath of the December 2013 floods, real GDP growth is estimated at 1.6 percent in 2015, led by recovering tourism inflows and a rebound in construction. Tourist arrivals increased by 6.6 percent (y/y) between 2014 and 2015, despite the relative competitiveness of St. Vincent and the Grenadines deteriorating since late 2014 due to a strengthening US dollar (Annex II). Headline inflation has declined because of falling fuel and food prices. Core inflation is 2.1 percent. Headline Food Core Fuel v o b F l Lower oil prices led to a narrowing of the current account deficit. The deficit moderated from 29.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 24.8 percent of GDP in 2015 Based on indicators through end-2015, imports contracted by over 8 percent (y-o-y) between 2015 and 2014, due to the value of oil imports dropping by 48 percent. Non-oil imports increased by 3 percent. t O v o Loans VCT ECCU Non-Performing Loans/Total Provisions for Loan Losses/Non- St.Vincent and the Grenadines vs. ECCU Financial Soundness Indicators (2012-2015) The commercial banking sector appears to remain solid, enabling a modest uptick in credit to the private sector that has been supportive of economic recovery. Commercial banks’ financial soundness indicators remained relatively stable at end-2015. Banks’ performance improved compared with the rest of the region, with rising profitability, decreasing levels of reported NPLs, better provisioning for the remaining NPLs and a capital adequacy ratio well above the regulatory requirement. The net interest rate margin has increased, as some banks pursued new lending activities and the ECCB dropped the deposit interest floor from 3 to 2 percent. As a result, and following a modest contraction in 2014, real credit to the private sector has grown by 1.7 percent in 2015, led by higher personal loans. This reduced the market share of credit unions, which had risen following the global financial crisis. Banks’ profitability, measured as return on assets (ROA), remains low, including with historically high excess reserves since growth in private deposits has outpaced that of credit to the private sector.
