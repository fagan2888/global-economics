Progress on structural issues has been mixed . The “open skies” framework—allowing for easier entry into the civil aviation market—is in place and delivering increased flights at lower costs (April 2014 structural benchmark), and preparatory work for overhauling bankruptcy processes is in motion. However, three structural benchmarks—on competition, inspection, and regulatory reforms—did not advance as expected. This reflects the government change and changes in senior officials at key ministries and agencies rather than differences of views or changes in commitments. The draft inspection law was submitted to parliament in October (March 2014 structural benchmark). The authorities expect to submit a packet for streamlining regulations by March 2015 (June 2014 structural benchmark). Further reforms agreed during discussions will aim at improving the business environment. The program envisages: (i) completion of the last phase of the Regulatory Guillotine program in order to lighten the regulatory burden on the private sector, and introduction of impact assessments for new regulations; (ii) strengthening reporting by companies to level the playing field and reduce the shadow economy; (iii) simplifying bankruptcy procedures in order to improve financial intermediation (June 2015 structural benchmark); (iv) further reforms in the energy sector to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the sector; and (v) strengthening institutional administration within the government, particularly regarding accounting and reporting (December 2014 structural benchmark). These reforms will help address critical weaknesses in Armenia’s business environment and, as a result, support growth.
