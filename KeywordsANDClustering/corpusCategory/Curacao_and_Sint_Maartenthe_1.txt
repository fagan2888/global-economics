Economic performance remains weak in both countries. For several years now, both countries have experienced lackluster growth, trailing behind regional peers. Curaçao experienced modest growth in 2015 of 0.1 percent, reflecting a turnaround from the contraction of 1.1 percent in 2014. Growth in Curaçao mainly reflected an increase in investment (both public and private), driven largely by the construction of the new hospital and the upgrade of road infrastructure. Meanwhile, the economy of Sint Maarten expanded by 0.5 percent in 2015, a slowdown compared to the 1.5 percent recorded in 2014. The expansion in Sint Maarten’s GDP mainly reflected an increase in stay- over tourist arrivals, though at a slower pace than in 2014. With the exception of the recent expansion project at the Princess Juliana International Airport, there was no major private investment in 2015, underscoring the need to boost investor confidence. Unemployment in both countries remains relatively high at 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, respectively. However, youth unemployment is estimated to be significantly higher, in the region of 30 percent for Curaçao and 25 percent for Sint Maarten. Production approach GDP statistics are not available.

Curaçao and Sint Maarten vis-à-vis Regional Peers (2015) Page 13 Inflation remains subdued, reflecting low pressure from international commodity prices. Following a period of moderate inflation during 2010 – 14, averaging 2.2 percent in Curaçao and 2.8 percent in Sint Maarten, inflation in Curaçao stood at -0.5 percent in 2015 and 0.3 percent in Sint Maarten, largely reflecting lower international oil prices. However, core inflation in Curaçao, which excludes food and energy, decelerated only modestly from 1.3 percent in 2014 to 1.1 percent in 2015. The Union’s current account deficit improved in 2015, for the fifth consecutive year, but remains in double-digits. The Union’s current account deficit narrowed to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2015 from 11.5 percent in 2014, reflecting a significant improvement in Sint Maarten’s external position, which was mostly offset by the deterioration in Curaçao. Sint Maarten recorded a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2015, relative to a deficit of 10.5 percent in 2014, primarily reflecting lower oil prices and higher tourism arrivals. In contrast, Curaçao’s current account deficit widened to 15.3 percent of GDP in 2015 from 11.9 percent in 2014, largely due to lower refining and transportation exports, and lower bunkering activities with the decline in oil prices. These were only partly offset by lower oil imports associated with the decline in oil prices. Curaçao and Sint Maarten were both fully compliant with their fiscal rules in 2015. Both countries complied with the rules-based fiscal framework, which comprises an “interest burden rule” (a cap on the interest payments to revenue ratio), and a “golden rule” of borrowing only for investment. Nonetheless, the public debt of the Union increased from 30.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 41.5 percent of GDP in 2015—partly but not entirely reflecting pre-financing—and fiscal performance for the two countries diverged noticeably. a. Curaçao ’s fiscal position deteriorated in 2015 with its primary balance widening to 1.7 percent of GDP from 0.7 percent in 2014. This reflected an increase in capital expenditure, with the construction of a new hospital, and budgetary transfers to cover Core inflation for Sint Maarten is not available.

Curaçao: Operations of the Government (in percent of GDP) Page 14 operational deficits of the SEHOS hospital and the national health insurance fund. The tax-to-GDP ratio moderately recovered to 25.7 percent in 2015, ending a four- year downward trend, due to improved tax compliance and increases in property tax rates. With interest payments at around 1 percent of GDP (or around 3½ percent of total government revenue), the overall fiscal deficit was 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015. The government issued three long term loans during 2014-15, totaling NAf 526 million (or 9.3 percent of 2015 GDP) to pre-finance the new hospital, resulting in a rapid buildup in public debt to 44.3 percent of GDP at end 2015 (compared with 34.6 percent in 2010). b. In contrast, Sint Maarten’s underlying fiscal position improved in 2015 with lower spending and higher tax revenues. The primary deficit narrowed to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015, from 3.9 percent in 2014, largely due to a decrease in capital spending and lower wage bill (which declined to 10.1 percent of GDP from 10.6 percent in 2014). Tax revenues increased to 20.3 percent of GDP from 19.7 percent in 2014, largely reflecting higher taxes on income and profits. The debt ratio declined to 36.5 percent in 2015 from 37.1 percent at end 2014. Credit growth remained weak despite ample liquidity in the banking system. Despite robust deposit growth, which has led to further accumulation of bank reserves to well above the regulatory requirement, private sector credit remains weak. This in part reflects a deterioration of asset quality (¶9), which has dampened banks risk appetites. Meanwhile, as credit demand remained subdued with long term investment decisions deterred by macroeconomic uncertainties, bank lending to private sector remained flat in 2015. Since 2014 (when the bank level credit ceilings were lifted) the central bank has relied solely on the auctioning of Certificates of Deposits to mop up excess liquidity, by offering more attractive rates and various maturities. Page 15 Despite a recent deterioration in asset quality and profitability, the banking sector appears to be generally stable, supported by adequate capital buffers. The nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans ratio remains elevated at 11.3 percent in 2015, as bank asset quality deteriorated during the recent economic downturn. This, along with a lower net interest margin and increased competition among banks, has negatively affected bank profitability. Banks’ capital buffers, however, appears to be adequate with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.6 percent in 2015, above the 10 percent regulatory requirement. Some local banks have recently reported a loss of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs), which calls for a proactive policy response by the authorities (¶34). The commercial banks undertook some adjustments in 2014 to lower their NPL ratios and increase their loan-loss provisioning, and in 2015 to increase their capital buffers, as precautionary measures to cover their credit risk and increase their ability to withstand possible macroeconomic shocks. pp Y Y Page 16
