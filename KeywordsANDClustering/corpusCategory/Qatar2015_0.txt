Qatar is implementing an ambitious diversification strategy, while retaining its systemic role in the global natural gas market. Qatar accounts for one-third of global LNG trade and has emerged as an important global financial investor, labor importer, and donor. The authorities are executing a $200 billion infrastructure program to advance economic diversification and prepare for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Qatar ranks favorably in social and governance indicators in the GCC region. The policy framework is being strengthened in the areas of fiscal policy and institutions, financial regulation, macroprudential policies, and debt market development, consistent with IMF advice (Annex I). Brent Oil Price Assumptions, 2012–20 (US$ per barrel) The steep fall in oil prices provided a new context for this year’s Article IV consultation. Having fluctuated in a narrow range of about $100-120 a barrel during the last several years, the Brent oil price benchmark unexpectedly fell to about $60 a barrel over the past six months. Futures markets suggest that a significant part of this decline is likely to persist over the medium term. Qatar is being affected since more than 90 percent of its budget revenues and exports are tied to activities of the hydrocarbon sector. Crucially, the price of Qatar’s LNG is linked to the price of crude oil. WEO Apr 2014 WEO Jan 2015 Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook.
