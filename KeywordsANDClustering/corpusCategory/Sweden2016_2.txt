Sustaining solid growth while containing macrofinancial vulnerabilities requires well targeted policy efforts. The expansionary monetary stance needs to be maintained to avoid prolonged low inflation that would prevent monetary policy regaining space to cushion shocks, and, if needed, some room remains to ease monetary policy. Fiscal policy should emphasize addressing migrant integration and housing challenges while moving to the new surplus target in the medium term, and it will need to play a larger than usual role in cushioning the economy in case of adverse shocks. Further macroprudential steps are needed to contain vulnerabilities associated with a likely continued rise in household indebtedness, which adds to the urgency of fixing the legal framework to enable more timely adoption of macroprudential measures as risks evolve. Expanded education should be complemented by temporary and targeted flexibility in entry-level wages to help migrants and others gain employment and over time become contributors to Swedenâ€™s strong social model.
