The financial sector, which is competitive with a significant presence of foreign banks, faces a number of structural problems. Foreign banks account for 66 percent of the banking system assets. (Text Figure 4). Financial depth has increased significantly over the past decade but the degree of financial intermediation, measured by the loansâ€™ term structure and their diversification across sectors, remains limited. The banks credit portfolio serves mainly some large and medium sized businesses involved in retail trade, public works, and transportation (Text Figure 5 and 6). Text Figure 4.

Large infrastructure projects have been receiving an increasing share of the banking credit, substituting for other economic activities such as manufacturing and transportation. This has been facilitated by a rapid increase in BCEAO financing (Text Figures 7 and 8) Text Figure 8. Togo: BCEAO Funding to Other Depository Institutions (In percent of total assets) Text Figure 7.
