Program risks have increased, mainly due to growing pressure on current spending and risks of domestic social unrest (Table 8). Political uncertainty in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2015, increasingly unreliable electricity and telecommunications access, and growing social pressure on recurrent spending constitute new or enhanced risks to program implementation in the near term. The constructed alternative scenario of a weather shock combined with a lack of additional donor support should yield similar results as these types of shocks. Ongoing risks of weather shocks, commodity price volatility, capacity constraints and low returns to investment remain unchanged. Spillover from regional security issues constitutes a less serious risk than in the past. Another emergent risk is that the National Assembly appears to be taking a less prudent role in tax policy, both with regard to the mining taxation code and revenue projections underlying the budget.
