An upturn is under way as the economy is enjoying the benefits of the euro depreciation and lower energy prices . The anticipation of the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE) significantly lowered interest rates and term spreads, weakened the euro, and, together with the drop in energy prices, helped overcome the unexpected slowdown of mid-2014 (Figure 1). By the end of last year and into the first quarter of this year, investment picked up again while consumption was supported by above-trend real disposable income growth. The latter benefited from robust real wage growth, a strong labor market, and the positive demand effects of the pension reform implemented last year (higher pensions for some mothers, and earlier statutory retirement for some categories of workers). The regained domestic demand momentum boosted imports, while the weaker euro during the second half of the year helped strengthen export performance in spite of a slowdown in emerging markets. The oil price drop brought inflation temporarily close to zero, contributing to lift real wage growth to a twenty-year high. Core inflation is low and stable at around 1 percent, while real compensation per employee increased by 1.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 2). Employment kept growing strongly—though the trend in total hours worked has been less dynamic—and the unemployment rate hit another post-reunification low at 4.7 percent, while Germany became the second largest migration destination in the world after the U.S. last year. Recent collective agreements and ongoing wage negotiations suggest continued significant real wage growth this year. The new minimum wage, introduced on January 1, 2015 and implemented over two years, has had no visible impact on total employment so far. The current account surplus continued to grow in 2014, reaching 7.6 percent of GDP. The narrowing of the oil and gas trade deficit was the main contributor to the expansion in the surplus (Figure 3), which was the largest in the world in USD terms. The surplus vis-à-vis euro area economies (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain) with high borrowing spreads during the 2010-11 sovereign debt crisis was stable after declining substantially during the crisis.

Page 13 saving-investment balances, non-financial corporations and the general government increased their surpluses in 2014 relative to 2013. In fact, the surplus of non-financial corporations, at 2.2 percent of GDP, reached its highest level since reunification. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate was roughly stable in 2014, but has since depreciated by 6 percent from its 2014 average primarily because of nominal depreciation vis-à-vis the dollar and the renminbi. The net international investment position (NIIP) continued to grow in 2014, reflecting stronger direct and portfolio investment positions. Yet, monetary and financial institutions cut back their net foreign lending position, continuing a trend observed since 2009. Fiscal policy was mildly contractionary in 2014, while it is expected to turn mildly expansionary in 2015. The government presented a balanced federal budget for 2015, one year ahead of schedule (Figure 4). The general government surplus rose to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014—a structural improvement of 0.3 percent relative to 2013—owing to lower-than-expected interest payments and one-off revenue items. A negative interest rate–growth rate differential pushed the debt ratio further down, to 74.7 percent of GDP. The structural fiscal position for 2015 is expected to remain comfortably within the boundaries set by the constitutional debt brake rule at the federal level and the European Medium-Term Objective (MTO) at the general government level (maximum structural deficits of 0.35 percent and 0.5 percent of GDP, respectively). Credit growth remains tepid despite record-low interest rates. The yield on 10-year bunds, after reaching a trough of 0.1 percent in mid-April, recently rebounded sharply as market volatility suddenly jumped—possibly reflecting lower market liquidity—but remains very low from a historical perspective, with negative yields extending up to the 3-year maturity. Already historically low bank lending rates have fallen further with the anticipation of QE (Figure 5), while stock prices have accelerated sharply. So far, however, credit growth has remained subdued, especially in the corporate sector, where companies can finance a large share of their investment needs from retained earnings and cash reserves, resulting in low credit demand. A more dynamic housing market (especially in some “hot spots”) over the past few years has been accompanied by tepid aggregate mortgage lending growth, although there are signs of acceleration in recent months. The Single Supervisory Mechanism’s (SSM) Comprehensive Assessment revealed only minor shortcomings in loan classification or provisioning but showed relatively low capital quality and leverage ratios in the large-bank segment of the banking sector. As expected, the higher provisioning needs identified by the asset quality review were concentrated in shipping finance and commercial real estate portfolios. All assessed banks, except a relatively small one, passed the stress tests. This very positive outcome was partially due to the fact that some types of capital that are being phased out under the new European regulation were still counted as eligible for the exercise. Furthermore, while banks’ leverage ratio is currently not subject to EU-wide regulation, SSM disclosures showed that many of the largest German banks had leverage ratios close to or below 4 percent (Figure 6), a level emerging as the new regulatory minimum in a growing number of European countries (Netherlands, Switzerland, U.K.). According to stress test results published by the European Banking Authority, a total of five German banks would have had a capital shortfall in the adverse scenario under a fully loaded (as opposed to phase-in) common equity Tier 1 metric.
