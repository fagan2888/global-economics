A sharp oil price drop materialized toward the end of 2014. Oil prices have recovered somewhat in 2015, but remain about 40 percent lower than their peak in mid-2014. However, the impact of the oil price drop on the real economy has been limited so far. The Norwegian economy grew steadily in 2014 despite the fall in oil prices. The mainland economy grew at 2.2 percent—about the same rate as in the previous year. Weaker investment demand was offset by stronger government consumption with private consumption roughly unchanged (Figure 1). Mainland GDP continued to grow at 0.5 percent (q/q) in the first quarter of 2015, supported by moderate growth in private consumption. Labor-force survey unemployment stayed low in 2014, but it has recently edged up to 4.2 percent (Figure 2). Registered unemployment shows a lower and more stable trend, however.

CPI inflation excluding tax changes and energy products (CPI- ATE) averaged 2.3 percent during the first five months of 2015. While inflation in domestically produced consumer goods has been edging down, imported consumer goods recorded strong price growth in early 2015, partly reflecting the recent exchange rate depreciation. Inflation expectations remain well anchored (Figure 3), and nominal wage growth slowed to 3.1 percent last year.

The exchange rate has depreciated significantly with the decline in oil prices. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) is about 13 percent below its 10-year historical average, reflecting the recent depreciation (Figure 4). External Balance Assessments (EBA) suggest that exchange rate is now slightly undervalued (Box 1). At the same time, the depreciation of the krone has offset some of the deterioration in unit labor cost (ULC) competitiveness over recent years. The current account surplus narrowed in 2014, driven mostly by declining oil and gas prices in the latter part of the year. However, the deficits on services and non-oil goods trade also widened modestly (Figure 4).

House prices briefly leveled out in late 2013 but started to rise again, growing at 7 percent in nominal terms in the first quarter of 2015. House price developments vary considerably across regions, with the Oslo area recording relatively more robust price growth while the Stavanger area where petroleum activity is concentrated showing more subdued growth. Household debt continues to rise, reaching about 220 percent of disposable income (Figure 5). The 2014 fiscal outturn entailed a positive fiscal impulse. However, the expansionary fiscal stance was within the fiscal policy rule that targets a structural non-oil deficit equal to 4 percent of Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) assets. Debt sustainability is not an important consideration (Annex I); gross public debt is about 30 percent of GDP and net financial assets are about 250 percent of GDP. The budget is well insulated from oil and gas prices through the fiscal rule. However, GPFG assets have been growing much faster than mainland GDP, and a transfer of even a constant share of its assets implies a trend toward a positive fiscal impulse. Moreover, because the GPFG is invested abroad, the decline in the krone exchange rate results in a large increase in the size of the fund relative to GDP.

Page 11 Banks’ profitability has been solid and banks have strengthened their capital ratios, but reliance on wholesale funding continues. Roughly 60 percent of funding is wholesale funding, more than half of it in foreign currency. This makes banks vulnerable to turbulence in global financial markets.
