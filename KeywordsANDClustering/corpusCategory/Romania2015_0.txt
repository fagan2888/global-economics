Romania has in large part reduced internal and external imbalances . This has been achieved through impressive fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary and financial policies, broadly in line with the 2012 Article IV recommendations (Annex I) and the 2011 and 2013 precautionary Stand-By Arrangements (SBA). However, a negative output gap persists, inflation is well below target and income convergence with the EU has been slow. Weak infrastructure has emerged as a bottleneck for a higher growth trajectory, reflecting ineffective public spending and weak medium-term planning, delayed EU funds absorption and slow SOE reforms. At the same time, Romania remains vulnerable to global and euro area shocks, given its relatively high level of external debt. While fiscal and foreign exchange reserves provide a buffer and non-performing loans were reduced substantially, private balance sheets need to be strengthened further. The reform momentum, however, has slowed amid elevated political uncertainty General elections in December 2012 resulted in a period of political stability that lasted until February 2014 when the ruling social democratic-liberal alliance broke down. Since then, two new cabinets were formed with changes in key economic ministries that have complicated policy continuity. The surprising win by the centre-right President Iohannis in the December presidential elections has raised near-term political uncertainty as the opposition is striving to form a new government through changing the parliamentary majority. The political uncertainty has affected the implementation of structural reforms, in particular as regards SOEs and gas price deregulation, which has delayed the completion of the third review under the SBA (scheduled originally for June 2014). Nonetheless, some progress has been made toward tackling corruption as evidenced by the 2015 Correction and Verification Mechanism for Romania that pointed out progress in a number of governance areas.
