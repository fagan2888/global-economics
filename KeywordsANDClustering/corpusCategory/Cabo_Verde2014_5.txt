Policy discussions focused on four key challenges facing Cabo Verde today. First, with public debt already at high levels, can fiscal policy still play a major role in supporting long-term growth? Second, given monetary policyâ€™s primary objective of safeguarding the peg, is there scope to loosen the monetary policy stance in support of the recovery? Third, how has the downturn affected financial stability? And fourth, what can be done to increase competitiveness and improve the long-term outlook for growth? These issues are central to ensuring macroeconomic and debt sustainability in the near term, and for helping Cabo Verde shift to a productivity-led growth strategy over the medium term.
