Growth remained low in 2015 as the external environment remained challenging and domestic demand lackluster. Real GDP growth stagnated at 1.5 percent in 2015, slightly below the 1.9 percent experienced in 2014. Solid performance in fisheries and agriculture contributed to growth, as did tourism, but construction and services contracted, and private sector credit stagnated due to weak demand and the corporate debt hangover from the real estate boom of previous years which ended abruptly with the growth slowdown. Headline inflation remained muted owing to lower food and energy prices, averaging 0.1 percent for 2015. The current account deficit contracted in 2015, and international reserve cover improved. The current account deficit shrank markedly to an estimated 4¼ percent of GDP, reflecting lower imports due to the slowdown in public and foreign direct investment, the recovery in tourism and continued strong remittances, with reserve coverage of 5.8 months of prospective imports. Tourism receipts increased by 3.3 percent and the number of tourists by 5½ percent in 2015, reflecting price competition and gains from the decline in tourism in North Africa. The recovery showed signs of taking off in the first six months of 2016. Real GDP grew by 5.9 and 3.6 percent respectively in the first and second quarter on account of tourism, agriculture, and public services. Tourist arrivals grew by 16 percent. Domestic demand showed signs of recovery as remittances remained strong and private sector credit inched up, reflecting the gradual reduction of corporate non-performing loans (NPLs). Policy implementation was broadly in line with Fund staff advice (Text Table 1). The authorities agreed that external debt should be curbed by reducing public investment while being mindful of growth. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue their structural reform program but advised a slightly more gradual approach, especially in the fiscal area where capacity constraints could be a significant challenge. In line with Fund advice, the BCV reduced the minimum reserve requirement to encourage credit growth and embarked on an accommodative monetary policy stance. Furthermore, a new labor code increasing labor market flexibility and lowering the cost of staff layoffs was submitted to parliament in late 2015 and entered into force in October 2016. Growth in tourism in 2015 was 4.4 percent globally, led by Europe with 5 percent, while SSA saw zero growth, and tourism in North Africa declined by 8 percent (World Tourism Organization, 2015).
