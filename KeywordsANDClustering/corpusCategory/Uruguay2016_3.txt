While the authorities avoided an overly contractionary policy stance in 2016, the room for countercyclical policies is limited . The fiscal package to reduce the general government’s deficit in 2017 is, by itself, projected to be procyclical, as output remains below potential. But delaying the structural fiscal consolidation could undercut the downward trajectory of net debt, jeopardize Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors, and potentially force an even more pro-cyclical tightening down the line. Given the weak economy and announced fiscal plans, the current monetary policy stance seems appropriate. However, with inflation still well above the upper-end of the target range, the authorities should stand ready to further tighten the monetary stance in 2017 as needed to safeguard the incipient reduction in inflation. A key challenge is to solidify the economic and social achievements of the past decade Several key prerequisites are in place for boosting diversified and inclusive growth over the medium term, including a trusted public sector and a high degree of social stability. In other areas, however, more progress is needed. The government has started addressing gaps in transportation infrastructure. Skills formation needs to be fostered through education reform. And the provision of credit for private sector investment could be enhanced. In addition, while the current fiscal plans are sustainable, there is less clarity beyond the government term. Longer-term anchors would strengthen the credibility of economic policies, with positive effects on confidence, investment and growth.
