Significant economic adjustment and policy reforms have been achieved since the crisis, with policies since the last Article IV being largely in line with past staff advice (Annex 4). However, further efforts are needed to complete the repair process. In particular, monetary policy should remain on hold until inflationary pressures are clearer and to help offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation, which is needed to help rebuild buffers. Such a mix of tight fiscal and loose monetary should also assist external adjustment. Mortgage-related macroprudential policies may need to tighten if the recent moderation of housing-related risks does not continue, financial sector supervision and regulation should remain conservative and intrusive, and the structural reform agenda should be completed.
