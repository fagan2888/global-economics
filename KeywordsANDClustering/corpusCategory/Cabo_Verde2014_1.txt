Over the last two decades, Cabo Verde has made impressive strides in economic and social development. Rapid economic growth, driven in large part by an expansion in tourism and public investment, helped the country graduate to middle-income country status in 2007. It has also dramatically reduced poverty—from 49 percent in 1989 to 25 percent in 2011—and raised living standards, such that achievement of all Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is within reach. Now, to sustain its progress over the medium term, Cabo Verde must identify new drivers of growth. The large-scale Public Investment Program (PIP) is beginning to wind down, and tourism may grow less rapidly as limits to market share are reached. In addition, with total factor productivity in Cabo Verde having fallen over the last decade, structural reforms that boost competitiveness are critical to support job-creating and inclusive growth (Appendix). At the same time, fiscal consolidation remains essential to ensure debt sustainability. During the last few years, the combination of weaker revenue performance and higher capital expenditure has driven up public debt to 98 percent of GDP at end-2013—a rise of 40 percentage points since 2008. Even though debt financing has been highly concessional, there are risks to debt sustainability if progress on fiscal consolidation stalls.
