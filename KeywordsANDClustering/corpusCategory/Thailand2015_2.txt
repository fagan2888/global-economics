Quarterly GDP Growth (Percent change) Growth. While political instability has affected growth, a tentative recovery has started in recent months. Following the intensification of political unrest starting in November 2013, the economy contracted sharply in the first quarter of 2014. The end of large-scale street protests following the military coup in May 2014 has contributed to an improvement in private sector confidence and a modest recovery. The economy grew by 1.5 percent (yoy) in the second half, with real GDP growth averaging 0.7 percent for the year. With flat final domestic demand and exports and a switch from large inventory accumulation in 2013 to a drawdown in 2014, it was a dramatic import compression (-4.8 percent) that allowed positive GDP growth for the year (Figure 1).

Core inflation has been stable since April 2014, moving within a very narrow range (Figure 2). However, energy prices declined precipitously starting in the second half of last year, even though the pass-through of lower global oil prices has been offset to a considerable extent by ongoing energy price reform (see ¶17). Food price inflation also slowed dramatically. As a result, headline CPI inflation fell sharply in the last few months and turned negative (-0.4 percent) in January 2015.

In recent months, the baht/USD exchange rate has been relatively stable in the face of considerable volatility in global financial markets, while the nominal and real effective exchange rates have appreciated noticeably. The current account balance improved significantly to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2014 from a deficit of 0.6 percent in 2013. The main reason is the sharp drop in the price of oil, which more than offset the impact of declines in the prices of Thailand’s export commodities, notably rice and rubber. Import compression was another contributing factor, with real net exports increasing despite a lackluster export performance and a fall in tourist arrivals as a result of the political situation. A financial account deficit roughly offset the current account surplus, and international reserves declined by US$10 billion to US$157 billion over the course of 2014, primarily due to valuation changes.
