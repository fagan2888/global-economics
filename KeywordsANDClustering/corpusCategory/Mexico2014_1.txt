Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 3.5 percent in 2015. Export demand from the US is expected to remain strong, underpinning the recovery of manufacturing production and related services. Construction activity should continue to strengthen, supported by the expansion of public investment in infrastructure and changes in Infonavit’s lending policies. Business investment is expected to recover as spare capacity diminishes and business sentiment improves after the recent approval of secondary legislation for the energy and telecommunications reforms (Box 3). Consumption growth would be supported by strengthening labor demand as activity picks up. The negative output gap—estimated by staff at around 1 percent as of mid-2014—is expected to close gradually over the next year. Headline inflation should decline toward the 3-percent target in 2015 as tax-related base effects dissipate, food prices return to normal, and fuel price adjustments moderate.
