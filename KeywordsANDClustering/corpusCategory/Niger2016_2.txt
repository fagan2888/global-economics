Growth increased in 2016, but barely above population growth (Table 1). Economic growth is estimated to have risen to 4.6 percent in 2016 (below the earlier projection of 5.2 percent), compared with 3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a good agricultural season and an expansion of crop irrigation that boosted agricultural production by nearly 8 percent. However, the resumption of oil production was slower than expected and government spending was constrained by lower revenue, in addition to adverse security developments, and the economic slowdown in neighboring countries affecting the services sector. Inflation remains well below the West African Economic Monetary Union’s (WAEMU) “three percent” convergence criterion (Table 2). Reflecting the good 2016-17 harvest and the government’s food security programs that play a stabilizing role, domestic food prices declined and thus consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2015 and through October 2016 at around 1 percent annualized. Weak oil prices further contributed to price stability (Figure 2). The overall fiscal balance improved in the first half of 2016, with all end-June performance criteria (PC) met. But deepening revenue shortfalls at end-September 2016 have forced a scaling back in expenditures (Tables 2 and 3). Revenues underperformed in 2016, Text Figure 2. Niger, Revenue Mobilization at end-September 2016 (in billions of CFAF) reflecting weaknesses in tax and customs administrations but also difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunication sectors, as well as lower trade flows with Nigeria (30 percent decline in total trade compared to end-September 2015) driven mostly by security threats, lower commodity prices and regional spillovers. While revenue underperformance was minor up to end-June 2016 (total revenue was short of the program target by 0.3 percent of GDP), by end-September 2016, the shortfall had widened to 2 percent of GDP, with revenues 14.5 percent below the level of end-September 2015 (Text Figure 2). Page 16 Revenue mobilization also suffered from weak non-agriculture activities in 2015 and lower-than- expected recovery in 2016, partly due to the impact of the 2016 elections and lower consumer confidence. The shortfall in corporate taxes was estimated at CFAF 20.5 billion in 2016 because advances paid in 2015 were higher than assessed taxes in 2016, permitting more deductions than projected. In addition, the depreciation of the Naira induced a diversion to the domestic parallel market of refined petroleum products. This diversion and depreciation contributed also to the overall decline of exports and re-exports to Nigeria, and to higher imports from Nigeria. As a result, at end-September 2016, VAT collections fell short by CFAF 30 billion, the special tax on petroleum products by CFAF 5.4 billion, and customs taxes by CFAF 26.2 billion. At end-June, domestically financed spending was under-executed relative to program targets, resulting in a basic balance in line with the program target. The government also cleared all end-2014 arrears. But at end-September, security and social spending pressures led to a deterioration of fiscal outcomes. End-September outcomes suggested the need for a downward revision of the end-2016 revenue target to reflect a projected shortfall estimated at CFAF 114.5 billion (2.6 percent of GDP). To offset it, the government took strong measures to contain spending by freezing planned non-priority- expenditures (including CFAF 48.2 billion in current spending), while safeguarding salaries, debt service payments, and security spending. The increase in the basic balance deficit was limited to CFAF 24.3 billion and to be financed domestically by CFAF 14.3 billion and by a slightly slower pace of reduction of domestic arrears. Broad money in the nine months through September 2016 increased by 9 percent, which is in line with estimates of economic activity (Table 4). Official net foreign assets decreased by 20 percent compared to end 2015, as the external budget support envisaged for the second half of the year will only be disbursed at the end of the year. Credit to the private sector also increased by 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, a deceleration relative to the previous year. Credit to the government increased by CFAF 98 billion from end 2015 as the government, faced with lower foreign support, turned to domestic financing. The current account deficit is projected to decrease from 18.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 15.4 percent in 2016 (Table 5). This reflects a reduction in imports that more than offsets the fall in goods exports due to low international prices for uranium and petroleum products, and the economic slowdown in Nigeria. At end-2015, gross official reserves remained at a comfortable level of 4.6 months of import of goods and services projected for 2016. The authorities are investigating the scale of the oil parallel market, while working on innovative measures to differentiate oil products destined to export and to the domestic market. Spending cuts were mostly related to office supplies, mission travel, maintenance, renovations, and infrastructure projects in some major cities. Page 17
