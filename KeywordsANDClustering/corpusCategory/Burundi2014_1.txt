over the medium term on the back of solid agricultural and construction activity, including the implementation of large hydroelectric projects. Further integration with the EAC is expected to spur investment in the tourism, wholesale and retail sectors, as well as in finance and telecommunications. Headline inflation is expected to decline to around 7 percent by end-2014 and should stabilize over the medium term in line with lower projected international food and fuel prices. Major floods that occurred earlier in the year and which damaged major transport routes, could contribute to an uptick in inflation in the months ahead. The fiscal position is expected to improve but remains subject to downside risks. The current account is expected to narrow to about 17 percent of GDP in 2014 as coffee exports rebound and would improve over the medium-term reflecting higher exports and moderate growth in imports following earlier surges associated with humanitarian efforts (Text Table 2).

Risks to the outlook remain elevated. A deterioration of the political and security situation, a further decline in donor support, a worsening in the terms of trade, or a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies could cause a slowdown in growth, reform implementation, and social unrest. While multilateral donors continue to provide budget support, albeit with stronger conditionality, bilateral donors continue to engage through project grants and performance-based sectoral budget support (Annex I). The authorities agreed with staff’s views on the outlook and noted that should these risks materialize, there would be limited fiscal space for countercyclical policies. However, they noted that greater exchange rate flexibility would be essential to respond to external shocks. MEFP ¶ 3
