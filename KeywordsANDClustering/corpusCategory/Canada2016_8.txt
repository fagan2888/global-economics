The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. The BOC should stand ready to cut the policy rate if downside risks materialize and the economy falters. However, with the policy rate at 0.5 percent, the room for additional cuts is limited (Figure 7). It would be appropriate to seek recourse to unconventional monetary policy measures in the event that the economy slows significantly and deflationary risks emerge, but clear communication would be critical. Staff welcomes the BOC’s recently updated framework for unconventional monetary policy, which includes forward guidance, large-scale asset purchases, negative interest rates, and funding for credit (Annex IV). The BOC is not committed to any specific order in which these policy measures will be used. Staff agrees that the efficacy of each measure will depend on the economic and financial context and, in some cases, the measures could be mutually reinforcing when used in combination. In the event unconventional monetary policy measures are put to use, the BOC should communicate clearly its diagnosis of the problem and the merits as well as the transmission channels of the measures it plans to pursue. Monetary policy is a blunt tool to address housing market vulnerabilities and macroprudential policy should remain the first line of defense in safeguarding financial stability. The costs of using monetary policy for financial stability objectives, or “leaning against the wind”, outweigh the benefits, except in circumstances where credit growth is exceptionally high for an extended period. Hence, macroprudential policy should generally be the first port of call to address financial stability risks, and this has indeed been the case in Canada. That being said, the BOC sees a role for monetary policy in financial stability and staff agrees that its risk management approach to monetary policy appropriately takes into account financial stability considerations within its flexible inflation targeting framework.
