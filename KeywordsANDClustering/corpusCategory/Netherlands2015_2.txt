An interrelated set of policies has given rise over the years to an overly leveraged Dutch economy . The tax system has a bias toward debt rather than equity for both households and firms. The high pension savings of most workers promotes security in old age, but the associated high contributions together with the high labor tax wedge can leave younger households cash-constrained. These constraints, together with the tax incentives for home ownership and mortgage debt and the absence of a well-functioning private rental market, promote premature home ownership and high household leverage. This in turn leaves the real economy vulnerable to shocks. There are also issues with the need for frequent changes in contribution, benefit accrual, and indexation in the pension system and tax and other incentives to reclassify employment relationships as self-employment. The government has taken important steps to address the inefficiencies in the housing market, support indebted households, address financial sector problems, and implement pension and labor reforms. However, there is more to be done, and because of the interrelated nature of the policies and their economic impact, there is merit in pursuing the reforms in tandem.
