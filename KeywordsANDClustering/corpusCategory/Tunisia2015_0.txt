AMID HIGH VULNERABILITIES The expected rebound in economic activity has not materialized. After averaging 4.5 percent during 2000–10, real GDP contracted by 1.9 percent in 2011, the year of the revolution. Since then, it has picked up, reaching 2.3 percent in 2014, fueled by a recovery in services, but still well below potential. However, the growth momentum waned in early 2015, with GDP growth averaging 1.2 percent (y- o-y) for the first semester as activity in the manufacturing, tourism, and mining sectors slowed significantly. Strike activity, work stoppages in the mining industry, and a decline in tourism arrivals (already 30 percent down following the Bardo attack) explains this performance.

The overall unemployment rate has improved, but remains high. After rising from 13 percent in 2010 to 18.9 percent in 2011, the unemployment rate improved to 15.2 percent in Q2- 2015, amid new public sector jobs and declining participation rates. Unemployment is even higher for women (22.2 percent), graduates (30 percent), and youth (35 percent). Inflation has been contained. After a peak of 6.6 percent in June 2013, headline inflation declined to 4.8 percent y-o-y by end-December 2014, as food price decline compensated for increases in administered energy prices. After increasing at the beginning of 2015, inflation rates have again been falling, reaching 4.2 percent in August following lower food and beverage prices. Core inflation followed a similar trend.

Weak tourism receipts, buoying imports (especially energy and capital goods imports), and declining oil and phosphate exports widened the current account deficit to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2014, its highest level since the 1980s. In the first half of 2015, exceptional olive oil exports and declining energy imports helped compensate the drop in tourism receipts, thereby narrowing the current account deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP in H1 2015 (relative to 5.3 percent of GDP in H1 2014). Foreign direct investments, mostly concentrated in the energy sector, have increased but are still at low levels. Official support and international market access—including the January 2015 issuance of a 10-year Eurobond ($1 billion at 5.875 percent), which for the first time since 2007 was completed without a third country guarantee—have helped keep Tunisia’s reserve levels above four months of imports, but below 100 percent of the Fund’s composite metric (Annex I).

Sovereign and CDS Spreads and Stock Index (In basis points, unless otherwise indicated) Financial markets have held up well. After peaking in mid-2012 at over 400bps, sovereign spreads narrowed significantly to 230bps following the completion of the political transition, although they widened again to 300bps following the Sousse attack. The Tunisian stock exchange—marred in the past by weak performance of public banks shares—has held up well amid limited turnover, even after coming down from record highs in the aftermath of the Sousse attack.

Following a significant deterioration during 2010–12, the fiscal stance improved, but at the expense of budget composition. The structural fiscal deficit—i.e., the deficit corrected for cyclical fluctuations and excluding banking recapitalization costs—improved from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2014. This improvement came with strong revenue collection and a higher wage bill—which increased by 37 percent over the past three years, reaching 12.7 percent of GDP in 2014—while public investment declined from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to a record low 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014. Public debt is on the rise, reaching 50 percent of GDP in 2014 (from 41 percent of GDP in 2010). The CBT maintained a prudent monetary policy stance, by gradually increasing its policy rate to 4.75 percent in June 2014 (from 3.5 percent in 2012). However, low deposit mobilization— caused by weak economic activity and deposit drawdown by cash-strapped mining companies impacted by work stoppages—are keeping several Tunisian banks (mostly public) structurally Page 17 illiquid. As a result, banks have been increasingly dependent on direct CBT refinancing that amounted to TD 5.6 billion by end-July, despite the February 2015 elimination of required reserves on consumer loans. Dinar liquidity is further constrained by continued CBT interventions in the foreign exchange market. Private sector credit picked up in 2014, but has recently slowed down to 7.3 percent at end-June 2015, in line with weaker economic activity.

The fragility of the banking system remains a concern. At end-March 2015, banking sector capital adequacy ratios stood at 9.5 percent (3.5 percent for public banks and 12.7 percent for private), below the regulatory requirement of 10 percent and with one public bank deemed insolvent. The overall NPL ratio is high—reaching 15.8 percent of total loans in March 2015 (approximately 21 percent of total loans after including bank subsidiaries)—and three banks (of which one public) are in violation of the liquidity ratio. At the same time, the provisioning rate improved from 46 percent in December 2012 to 56.6 percent in March 2015 following the implementation of new prudential regulations in 2013. Given the burden of NPLs on net banking income, the profitability of the banking sector is low—particularly for public banks—but has improved in 2014, mainly due to an increase in commission fees and the reduction in provisioning.
