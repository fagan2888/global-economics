Competitiveness is weak and the REER overvalued (Annex I) . High real wage growth amid slow productivity rise has eroded the gains from the 2009 devaluation, and the real exchange rate remains significantly misaligned (by 14–16 percent). Economy-wide unit labor costs and the ULC-based REER have exceeded their high 2008 levels. Staff estimates indicate that even if fiscal policy gaps were closed while maintaining the current exchange rate level, the need for a significant devaluation would persist. Large gross financing needs pose substantial risks. Debt rollover risks are high with external debt above 75 percent of GDP and a gross external financing requirement of 37 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 4). The rollover risks are mitigated to some extent by the fact that a large portion Page 9 of the debt represents significant inter-company lending and transfer pricing operations. The NBU’s international reserves are low against several common metrics (Annex I).
