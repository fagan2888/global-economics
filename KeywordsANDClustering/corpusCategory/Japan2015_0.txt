In late 2012, Japan launched “Abenomics,” an economic revival plan to exit from decades-long deflation, low growth, and rising public debt. The three-pronged strategy of aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms promised to be a clear break from previous incremental efforts. So far, the pace of real GDP growth has remained similar to the post-bubble period at about 1 percent, and deflation risks remain. This is partly due to external shocks, including slower global growth and the collapse in commodity prices. In addition, the negative impact of the consumption tax rate hike in 2014 was bigger than expected as nominal wage growth fell short of inflation despite very tight labor market conditions. However, structural impediments have also played a role, including rigid wage dynamics due to labor market duality and the deeply entrenched deflationary mindset, while the effects of the sharp yen depreciation on exports and domestic investment have been weaker than expected due to a trend increase in production offshoring and headwinds from population aging. Abenomics needs to be reloaded so that policy shortcomings do not become a drag on growth and inflation. With the exception of corporate governance and some progress on female labor force participation, structural reforms have not yet been in areas that could provide the biggest bang for the buck (Annex I). While there are concerns that structural reforms may be deflationary in the short term as they expand supply, a comprehensive package should bring forward demand and contribute to wage and price pressures. Fiscal policy needs to provide clear direction to reduce uncertainty for the private sector. And monetary policy should provide stronger guidance to markets.
