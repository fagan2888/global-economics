Rising U.S. interest rates. A gradual, anticipated rise in U.S. interest rates should not unduly dampen domestic demand; and the steepening of the U.S. yield curve following the presidential election has not affected confidence thus far, Hong Kong SAR interbank rates and major trading partner bilateral exchange rates have been broadly stable. Following Fed rate hikes, consumption typically grows at an orderly but slower pace. However, an unanticipated tightening of stance could have a bigger-than-usual adverse impact on consumption and domestic demand given the high level of household debt and low income growth. The leverage and debt service ratio of nonfinancial corporates in Hong Kong SAR has also been rising since 2010, and prolonged low interest rates may have encouraged them to take on excessive foreign exchange risk, with external debt by nonfinancial corporations rising from 30 percent of GDP in 2010 to 80 percent in 2015. U.S. rate hikes Page 24 combined with U.S. dollar appreciation could result in significant losses, increasing default risks. The rising cost of refinancing and rolling over corporate debt could also inhibit investment. European banks, Brexit or emerging market growth uncertainties could also tighten financial conditions. Market volatility has remained contained post-Brexit and lower than in previous stress episodes. Share prices of the major U.K. banks which have a large market presence in Hong Kong SAR quickly returned to pre-Brexit levels. However, high connectedness with the U.K. financial sector (with liabilities to the United Kingdom of 111 percent of GDP) means that shocks impinging on the U.K. financial system or on European banks could have large spillovers to Hong Kong SAR. Second-round effects could emerge from funding strains at bank group level, foreign exchange mismatch or from credit risks in locally incorporated banksâ€™ overseas loan books.
