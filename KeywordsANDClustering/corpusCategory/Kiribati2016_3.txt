Accommodating Kiribati’s considerable public spending needs in a fiscally sustainable way requires embedding policies in a medium-term fiscal framework. While the government’s balance sheet is currently strong owing to large RERF assets and relatively low public debt, available fiscal space is limited by the projected decline in fishing revenue and Kiribati’s continued high risk of debt distress. To support implementation of the authorities’ development plan in a fiscally sustainable way, this fiscal framework should include: (i) committing to a balanced structural budget over the medium term; (ii) strengthening the RERF as an anchor for long run fiscal sustainability by formulating a rule-based withdrawal mechanism; and (iii) maintaining an appropriately-sized cash reserve buffer to cope with revenue volatility and external shocks. Committing to a balanced structural budget over the medium term. Steps are needed to ensure fiscal sustainability in the face of a projected moderation of annual fishing license fees to the A$100 million range over the medium term. On current policies, staff’s baseline projections envisage a widening of the recurrent deficit to around 10 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting in a gradual depletion of the RERF (Box 2). A more sustainable outturn would be achieved by targeting a structurally balanced budget over the medium term, based on assumed fishing license fees of A$100 million (text table below). This would require fiscal adjustment of around 4½ percentage points of GDP in 2017 rising to 8½ percentage points by 2021 compared to the baseline scenario. The adjustment could comprise efforts to boost revenue collection (e.g., by phasing out VAT exemptions to restore tax revenue collection to the 2015 level) and steps to limit recurrent spending growth to under 1.5 percent per year. Staff advise to cap nominal spending on copra subsidies at the 2016 level and refrain from any increase in subsidies and grants beyond the 2016 budget commitment. Wage increases should also be set within the current wage policy framework which allows for a “wage drift” from the automatic promotion process without additional increases in salaries. The recommended structural budgeting approach would insulate spending from potential volatility in fishing license fees. In the event of a temporary surge in fees, the resulting fiscal surplus should be saved in the RERF, while any shortfall in fees relative to the A$100 million baseline could be met by transfers to the budget from the reserve buffer. As additional information is accumulated on license fee trends, the A$100 million baseline can be gradually adjusted, while preserving a structural balance to ensure fiscal sustainability. This projection is consistent with projected 2016 receipts and with the expected reversal of recently favorable climatic conditions. While the impact of the different factors contributing to strong fishing license revenue performance cannot be clearly delineated, the recent strong El Niño effect is believed to have attracted tuna to Kiribati’s warmer waters, contributing to higher catch volumes and greater demand for Vessel Days. Since the peak at end-2015, the sea surface temperatures in Kiribati waters have started to rapidly cool. Forecasts of the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle are highly uncertain due to historical irregularity, but the opposite phases of El Niño (implying warmer than normal surface water temperatures for Kiribati) and La Niña (cooler waters) occur on average every two to seven years. Prolonged peak episodes may last for years. Page 13 Medium-term Fiscal Projections (% of GDP) Formulating a target-level for the RERF and a rule-based withdrawal mechanism. After strengthening the RERF, the structural balance target discussed above could be adjusted over the longer term to allow moderate annual financing from the RERF. This process should be rule- based and transparent, to simplify budget planning and to ensure that the RERF is maintained as an endowment fund that can provide the population with a permanent and stable stream of income. The sustainable level of the RERF drawdown depends on the government’s wealth management target (see Box 2 for a scenario analysis of the RERF). If the goal is to preserve the real value of the fund after reaching a certain level, the withdrawal rate should be limited to around 1–2 percent of the overall balance, assuming an average return rate on the fund of 3– 201620172018201920202021Baseline Scenario Revenue63.058.157.256.956.556.1Tax revenue14.814.314.314.314.414.2Nontax revenue48.243.842.942.642.141.9Current expenditure66.965.664.965.966.466.4Wages and salaries27.727.026.426.225.925.6Subsidies and Grants18.417.917.417.216.916.6Other current expenditure19.919.819.820.120.220.5Debt servicing0.50.30.31.11.51.4Contingency and maintenance0.40.60.91.41.92.4Recurrent fiscal balance with budget support-0.5-4.3-5.7-7.1-8.1-8.5RERF balance (A$, million)865.6880.0890.9897.6901.7904.5 Adjustment Scenario: Balanced Budget Revenue63.059.658.958.958.858.8Tax revenue14.815.916.016.316.617.0Nontax revenue48.243.842.942.642.141.9Current expenditure 1/66.962.561.061.261.060.2Wages and salaries27.726.726.025.525.024.5Subsidies and Grants18.417.717.217.016.716.4Other current expenditure19.917.116.616.315.915.6Debt servicing0.50.30.31.11.51.4Contingency and maintenance0.40.60.91.41.92.4Recurrent fiscal balance with budget support-0.50.3-0.1-0.4-0.40.4RERF balance (A$, million)865.6891.0916.0941.1967.0995.61/ The 2016 current expenditure includes a one-off payoff to the Ministry of Health of A$2.2 million.Source: staff calculations. Medium-term Fiscal Projections (% of GDP) Page 14 5 percent and a long run inflation rate of 2.5 percent. The withdrawal could also be indexed to nominal GDP based on the projected long run average growth rate and the targeted return rate of the fund—under this approach the withdraw would be a more stable source of public financing, but it could also make the RERF balance more volatile depending on the return of the fund. In either case the drawdown from the RERF could be gradually adjusted if needed to preserve the real value of the fund in the event of shortfalls in investment returns. Maintaining the real value of the fund over the long run would also be consistent with the authorities’ policy to ensure a more equitable distribution of the income from the RERF between generations while protecting the capital growth of the fund Limiting the complementary cash reserve buffer to three months of recurrent expenditure. The sizeable cash reserves from the 2014–15 fishing license revenue in excess of this amount should be transferred to the RERF as soon as possible. On the basis of the 2016 level of current expenditure, this would leave a cash reserves buffer of roughly A$40 million (40 percent of the projected fishing revenue) against future temporary revenue shortfalls and external shocks. The policy of drawdowns from the cash buffer should be transparent and also ensure its replenishment when revenue exceeds expectations. Any fiscal surplus after replenishing the cash reserve buffer should be transferred to the RERF to expand its principal base. The VAT introduced in 2014 was a key element in fiscal reforms to reverse a decline in the non-fishing revenue since 2008. Implementation of the VAT has been broadly successful in diversifying the revenue base, but there remains scope for further improvement. The revenue outcomes in 2014–15 were in line with expectations and the new tax also had positive spillover effects on other revenue collection through improved record keeping and tax compliance. However, the VAT implementation was partially hampered by reintroduced SOE exemptions in late 2015, which was estimated to have reduced VAT collection by around 15 percent in 2016. As such, staff urge the authorities to phase out the SOE exemptions to ensure the credibility of the tax system and maintain a level playing field for public and private entities. Further training of tax office staff, greater utilization of improved IT systems and increased emphasis on tax payer assistance would also improve the overall performance of revenue collection. Kiribati remains at high risk of debt distress despite of the RERF assets. As the RERF serves as a vehicle for intergenerational saving, it is not viewed as buffer against debt distress risk. In this regard, containing the risk of debt distress will require ensuring fiscal sustainability and securing grants to finance the country’s large development needs. Government borrowing through concessional loans should be closely monitored to safeguard long run debt sustainability. The projected RERF return rate reflects the more conservative investment strategy of the fund after its restructuring. Information was from the World Bank Treasury who has been providing technical assistance to the RERF reform. Page 15 Box 2. Kiribati: Fishing Revenue and the Impact on the RERF The RERF forms the primary savings vehicle for the Kiribati people. It was initially capitalized with revenue from phosphate mining royalties until deposits were exhausted in 1979 and continued to grow through its investment returns and modest drawdowns. However, acceleration in drawdowns to finance a sharp increase in current expenditure since the turn of the millennium and periods of negative investment returns in early 2000s and during the global financial crisis significantly eroded the fund’s capital base until recently. Future growth of the fund will depend heavily on fishing revenue. Staff’s simulations indicate that in the baseline scenario, due to the projected decline in fishing revenue to around A$100 million dollars leading to a widening deficit that needs to be financed by RERF drawdowns, the RERF nominal balance will decline gradually to below A$800 million dollars by 2030. If a balanced structural budget can be achieved over the medium term, the RERF balance will reach A$1 billion by 2021 thanks to the accumulation of investment returns. If the authorities set the target to preserve the real value of the fund at the A$1 billion level, this would allow a 1.5 percent annual withdrawal equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2021. On the other hand, if fishing revenue declines to A$60 million (average level since 2001), the current pace of spending would be unsustainable, leading to a depletion of the RERF in about 15 years. Preservation of the RERF’s real value would still imply some erosion in its value in per capita terms. Tolerance to this cost would ultimately depend on the authorities’ policy preferences for intergenerational income distribution and would need to be weighed against investment needs for economic and social development. At the current low-yield environment, a real per capita target would limit any drawdowns from the RERF given the projected long-run annual rate of population growth of 1.5–2 percent. Any new investment expenditure plans should also be carefully framed within a stronger PFM framework. Given limited resources, priorities of public investment should be placed on functions that yield high economic and social returns, namely, infrastructure investment, regulatory framework and business facilitation services. Scaling up of infrastructure spending through the budget should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Consideration should also be given to enhancing the monitoring and reporting of fishing revenue and further improving the monitoring and auditing of SOE and joint-venture liabilities. Authorities’ Views The authorities welcomed staff’s analysis on the medium term fiscal position and noted that the government had implicitly targeted a balanced budget historically. While the new government was still formulating its medium term fiscal framework, they saw drawings from the dg Page 16 RERF as a last resort and then only for development, rather than recurrent, purposes. They welcomed staff’s recommendation for a rule-based withdrawal mechanism for the RERF and would consider it in the context of the government’s fiscal and development strategy. The authorities also expressed their intent to transfer the current cash reserves in excess of three months of recurrent spending to the RERF, a process that had been temporarily delayed given a change in wealth managers, in line with staff recommendations.
