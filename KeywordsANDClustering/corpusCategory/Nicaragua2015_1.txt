Economic activity accelerated to 4.7 percent in 2014 from 4.5 percent in 2013 owing to robust external demand that more than compensated for the negative contribution of private investment (Table 1 and Figure 1). On the supply side, growth has been broad based with the largest contributions coming from commerce and agriculture. Strong growth has been facilitated by a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector. Despite a small and positive output gap, inflation pressures remained subdued owing to developments in commodity prices. Notwithsta nding strong economic activity, the unemployment rate increased to 6.8 percent in 2014 from 5.7 percent in 2013, due in part to a decline in employment in the free trade zones (FTZ). Public finances remained broadly sound, but the fiscal position weakened in 2014 . The central government deficit widened to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 from 0.4 percent in 2013 (Table 2 and Figure 2). This was largely due to a decline in grants funded by the oil collaboration scheme with Venezuela that had been used to fund a wage bonus. The deficit of the consolidated public sector widened from 1.3 percent in 2013 to 2 percent in 2014, owing to the deterioration of the operating balance of the social security institute (INSS) and the central bank (Table 3). Nevertheless, the public debt ratio declined to about 41 percent of GDP in 2014 from 43 percent in 2013. The external position improved in 2014 . The current account deficit for 2014 is estimated at 7.1 percent of GDP, 4 percent of GDP lower than in 2013 (Table 7, Figure 3). The reduction is explained by an increase in exports and a smaller oil bill. The current account deficit was financed by FDI and other investment, particularly from Venezuela. As a result, gross international reserves reached US$2.1 billion at end-2014, with coverage reaching 4.1 months of non- imports. The wage bonus (“ bono solidario ”) is a wage supplement provided to public employees mostly at the low er end of the pay structure; it w as absorbed into the budget in 2014. Non-maquila i mports exclude imports used in the assembly, processing, or manufacturing of goods and services in Nicaragua’s FTZ. Page 11 The current account balance is close to its norm and the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals (Appendix I— External Assessment) The improvement in the current account balance in 2014 closed the gap with the estimated current account norm (-6.9 percent of GDP). Consequently, there is no significant evidence of misalignment of the REER (1.2 percent overvaluation as of end-2014). Macroeconomic risks at end-2014 have decreased somewhat compared with end-2013 driven by an improvement in the external position . Credit risks, however, have increased due to household financial conditions (indicated by higher unemployment), rapid credit growth, and higher share of foreign exchange liabilities in total liabilities. Meanwhile, inward spillover risks decreased, reflecting an improvement in the buffers against external shocks (as indicated by improved reserve coverage). Portfolio investment and FDI to GDP remained stable, but lower nominal effective exchange rate volatility suggests a lower risk appetite compared with end-2013. Poverty has fallen sharply and there has been progress in gender equality, but education attainment remains a drag on growth (Table 11). The 2014 household survey reveals that 29.6 percent of the population live in poverty (42.5 percent in 2009), and 8.3 percent in extreme poverty (14.6 percent in 2009). Per capita consumption increased by 33 percent, helped by a fall in the average household size and a rise in per capita remittances. Nicaragua has made inroads in improving gender equality. For instance, the proportion of seats held by women in the National Assembly has doubled in the last five years. However, despite some improvement in primary school completion rates (from 74 percent in 2005 to 80.4 percent in 2010), surveys of private firms suggest that labor skills remain a significant bottleneck to growth. A private think-tank that has carried out annual su rveys of households in the 2009–13 period estimates more modest declines in poverty; from 44.7 percent in 2009 to 40.5 percent in 2013 and w ith even less of an impact in extreme poverty among rural households as these are exposed to commodity price shocks.

Page 12 Economic developments in 2015 have been broadly positive Growth and inflation are moderating owing to the effects of a drought and the decline in commodity prices . The Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) decelerated to 3.5 percent (yoy) in January-September compared with 4.9 percent during the same period in 2014, with the strongest contributions coming from commerce and services and construction, which continue to be supported by rapid credit growth. By contrast, the main drags are agriculture (irregular rain cycle) and manufacturing (particularly from FTZ). Real GDP grew by 3.9 percent in the first half of the year. Inflation declined to 3 percent (yoy) in October, almost 4 percentage points below inflation a year ago, owing mostly to declines in food and transportation costs. Core inflation remains stable at around 6½ percent (yoy). The fiscal position through August 2015 improved relative to the same period in 2014 This is explained largely by a better performance at the central government level, with revenue growing faster than expenditure, aided in part by the decision to transfer some electricity-related savings onto the budget. In 2015, the stronger performance of the central government has compensated for the deterioration in the fiscal balance of SOEs arising from higher capital spending in the water and sewage (ENACAL) and the electricity generation (ENEL) companies. In October, the government enacted a revised budget that aimed at spending additional tax revenues and loan resources. The current account deficit deteriorated in the first half of 2015 as the country faced a less favorable external environment . The current account deficit widened to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2015H1 from 3.1 percent in 2014H1. This reflects the lackluster performance of exports as a result of the softening of commodities prices and the expiration of the preferential trade agreement with the United States in late 2014. CARUNA provided loans during 2011–13 to allow distributors to keep tariffs for residential consumers at their 2005 levels, w ith repayment occurring when electricity costs fell below a reference level. This began to occur in 2014, due to falling oil prices. Under a law passed in 2015, how ever, only 30 percent of these savings are now directed towards repayment of CARUNA, while 47 percent w ill be passed on to the consumer and 23 percent brought onto the budget to finance poverty-reducing expenditure. Tariff Preference Level (TPL) under the CAFTA-DR free trade agreement allow ed apparel made of certain cotton and synthetic fiber to enter the U.S. duty free if assembled in Nicaragua’s free trade zones, regardless of the origin of the fabrics.

Page 13 The financial sector appears to remain robust despite still high credit growth (Text Table and Table 8). As of August 2015, capital adequacy ratios (13.3 percent) were above the 10 percent regulatory level, and the NPL ratios, including restructured and reprogrammed loans, remained below 3 percent. Private sector credit growth has slowed but remains high (20 percent), in particular for consumer and commercial credit, and continues to exceed the growth rate of deposits
