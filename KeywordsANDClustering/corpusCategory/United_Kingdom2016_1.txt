The economy continued to grow steadily in 2015, with the output gap almost closed. However, near- term uncertainty has risen substantially due to various factors—most notably the forthcoming referendum—and appears to have slowed growth somewhat this year. Under staff’s baseline scenario, which assumes that the UK remains in the EU, growth is projected to recover later this year as referendum-related effects fade. Growth is then expected to average near its estimated potential rate of about 2.2 percent over the medium term. Inflation is projected to rise gradually back to the 2 percent target as effects from past commodity price falls dissipate and as wages rise in response to tighter labor markets. However, this relatively benign baseline scenario is subject to major risks, including those related to the referendum, productivity growth, the buoyant housing market and household debt, and the large current account deficit.
