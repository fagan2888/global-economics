The program is on track (MEFP ¶5-6 and MEFP Tables 1, 3a, and 3b): All performance criteria and most indicative targets were met. The authorities are seeking a waiver of applicability for the end-April ceilings on the general government’s primary fiscal balance and primary expenditure, for which data are not yet available. Staff expects these PCs to have been met. The December 2015 indicative target on contracting non-energy guarantees was missed by a very small margin (0.03 percent of GDP). Going forward, the authorities are proposing to remove this IT, as non-energy guarantees are now fully captured in their fiscal framework. The IT on the accumulation of new central government domestic arrears was missed by a small margin (0.09 percent of GDP) in December 2015. However, the authorities will repay all accumulated arrears by mid-2016, except for those on court decisions regarding layoffs and expropriations which will be settled in accordance with a special Council of Ministers (CoM) decision. As a remedial measure, the authorities are improving public investment management and seeking rapid implementation of multi-year commitment limits. Most structural benchmarks (SBs) were implemented, albeit one with a delay. Of the six SBs, three were met on time. Of the remaining three, one was implemented with a delay (as a prior action), and one is proposed to be rescheduled. The need to build support and allow sufficient time for consultations with stakeholders delayed amendments to the Budget Law, but these were submitted to Parliament in early May 2016, as a prior action. The roll-out of the new treasury IT system (AGFIS) to 15 budget institutions has been delayed to end-May 2016, to allow time to train new users of the system. The need to fine-tune the implementation plan to restructure the tax agency’s headquarters delayed its adoption to May.
