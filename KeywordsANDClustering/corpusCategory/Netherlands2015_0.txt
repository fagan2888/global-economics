A moderate recovery is underway after a double-dip recession that ended in early 2014. Growth is expected to rise from 1.0 percent in 2014 to about 2 percent in 2015 and 2016. GDP growth slowed sharply in 2015:Q2 as natural gas production and exports have been cut because of seismic events in the gas production region. This reduced growth by half a percentage point in 2015. Domestic demand continues to strengthen at a moderate pace. Unemployment is falling slowly. The unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in September 2015 from its February 2014 peak of 9.5 percent based on the national definition. However, unemployment still remains well above the 5–7 percent range of 2003–07, and it is much higher for 15–25 year olds and slightly higher than average among women and the 45–65 year old group. The unemployment rate on the Eurostat definition has been running about 1½ below the national definition and stood at 6.8 percent in September 2015.

Page 9 Inflation is low, but positive. Core inflation was 1.4 percent in October 2015, while headline CPI inflation was held to 0.7 percent by falling energy prices. Inflation in services is higher at just under 2 percent. Credit has continued to decline, but surveys point to a turnaround in demand for credit . ECB quantitative easing has increased liquidity, but it has not yet spurred lending. Credit has continued to decline, although credit to households appears to have bottomed out in early 2015. Weak demand for credit appears to be a more important factor than either liquidity or capital constraints. However, this may be turning around; lending surveys have been reporting increased demand from households and large enterprises since early 2014, while the most recent lending survey reported stable rather than declining credit demand from SMEs for the first time since early 2009. The Dutch banking system is emerging from its restructuring. Dutch banks continue to adjust to tightening capital and liquidity requirements. Banks’ capital levels are well above minimum requirements, and comfortably on track to meet the Basel III requirements. Also, the Dutch government sold a 20 percent stake in ABN-AMRO that it had taken on in the course of the global financial crisis. The schedule for sale of the remaining shares hasn’t been set. House prices have started to recover. However, they remain well below peak levels. Prices have risen by more than 5 percent since the 2013 trough, but they are still 17 percent below their 2008 peak in 2015:Q3. More than a quarter of Dutch households have mortgage debt in excess of the house value, primarily among younger households. The recovery in housing prices is uneven.
