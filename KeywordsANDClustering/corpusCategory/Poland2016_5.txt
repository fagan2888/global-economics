Fiscal consolidation continued in 2015. The general government deficit narrowed to 2.6 percent (a cyclical primary adjustment of 0.3 percent of GDP), benefitting from a sustained economic recovery, lower government consumption of goods and services, and an increase in social contributions. Public debt increased modestly to 51.3 percent of GDP at end-2015. However, as the output gap closed in 2016, the fiscal stance has become procyclical. Staff estimates that implementation of election promises will increase the deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2016 (a cyclical primary relaxation of 0.2 percent of GDP). Specifically, the government’s new child benefits program, beginning in April 2016, is expected to cost about 1 percent of GDP annually, financed in part by a tax on bank assets and a retail tax (¼ percent of GDP) and one-off mobile frequencies auction revenues (0.4 percent of GDP). The authorities’ Convergence Program update envisages an increase in the fiscal deficit to just under 3 percent in 2017, with subsequent consolidation to 1.3 percent of GDP by 2019 (Text-Table 2). This is largely based on the assumption that, on the back of strong nominal GDP growth, revenue will outpace moderate increases in social benefits and wages and salaries, which authorities intend to keep constant in real terms. The program also assumes sizable revenue gains from tax administration improvements, estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP by 2017 and increasing to 1 percent of GDP by 2019. In staff’s view, on unchanged policies, the 2017 fiscal deficit will increase to 3.1 percent of GDP, postponing the fiscal consolidation further and adding to demand at a time when growth is above potential. Moreover, there are additional risks to the 2017 fiscal stance that are not included in staff’s baseline. In particular, in addition to already announced measures, the government intends to reverse the 2013 retirement age increases, which could cost an additional 0.5 percent of GDP per year, and to increase the Constitutional Court- mandated personal income tax (PIT) tax-free allowance, which if introduced gradually could initially cost 0.2 percent of GDP per year, increasing to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2019. Without A tax on assets of credit institutions, lending companies, and insurance undertakings took effect on February 1, 2016. The tax on banks will be levied on the total value of assets (less PLN 4 billion, own funds, and purchased sovereign debt) at a monthly rate of 0.0366 percent. State-owned banks (relevant for BGK with legal status of state enterprise) and banks under recovery proceedings, in receivership, in liquidation, or those who filed for bankruptcy are excluded from the tax (NBP, Financial Stability Report, February, 2016). A retail tax is still under discussion. Page 26 offsetting measures, this would also imply breaching the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) threshold by a wide margin. Text-Table 2. Poland: Convergence Program Update (Percent of GDP) Sources: Ministry of Finance and IMF staff calculations. Over the medium term, staff projects a less ambitious deficit reduction on current policies. Assuming a more conservative budgeting of tax administration gains, less optimistic growth assumptions, and a higher wage bill to reflect continuing upward pressure from accelerating private sector wages and the absence of specific measures to maintain public sector wages constant in real terms, staff projects that the deficit would decline to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2020, 1.3 percentage points of GDP above the government’s medium-term objective (MTO) of 1 percent of GDP structural deficit. General government debt is projected to increase until 2018, then decline over subsequent years (Annex II). Fiscal policy should take advantage of strong growth to resume consolidation already in 2017. The government’s MTO of 1 percent of GDP structural deficit remains an appropriate fiscal anchor—allowing for sufficient buffers in the event external risks materialize, while also creating fiscal space to address looming demographic challenges. Relative to 2017, measures of around 2 percent of GDP would be required to reach this objective. Taking advantage of favorable economic conditions, consolidation starting in 2017 at an annual pace of around 0.5 percent of GDP would reach the MTO by 2020 (Text-Table 3). The deficit reduction should be underpinned by credible growth-friendly measures to help support market confidence and maintain budget financing on favorable terms.

Poland: Authorities’ Medium-Term Target and Staff Baseline (Percent of GDP) Source: Ministry of Finance and IMF staff calculations. Staff noted that measures underlying the 2016 budget are of poor quality and pose risks to the 2017 fiscal outcome. The 2016 budget is partly financed through one-off revenues and distortionary sectoral taxes, which should be gradually replaced with higher- quality and growth-friendly measures to avoid adverse effects on trade and credit expansion. For 2017, to keep the deficit below 3 percent, specific measures should be identified. Staff recommended maintaining the 2011 VAT increase, scheduled to expire in 2017, and rationalizing discretionary government consumption (which is sizable at around 6 percent of GDP) through the ongoing expenditure review. To support the medium-term consolidation, staff recommended a menu of possible measures: (i) closing ⅓ of the VAT policy gap by reducing preferential rates and exemptions; (ii) closing ½ of the efficiency gap in health spending, including by shifting towards ambulatory and primary care; (iii) gradually closing ⅓ of the VAT compliance gap through tax administration improvements; and (iv) gradually phasing out preferential pension regimes of miners and farmers (Text-Table 4). In this respect, staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration, but cautioned that any revenue gains should be budgeted conservatively, particularly in the short run. Until higher revenues materialize, the 2011 VAT increase should be maintained. Staff urged the authorities to reconsider the proposed reduction in the retirement age. Reversing the gradual increase in the retirement age, to 67 for both men and women (by 2020 and 2040, respectively, from 65 and 60 in 2013), as currently intended, could further reduce the pension replacement rate, increasing the risk of old-age poverty and potentially further weakening public finances, thus undermining the social and financial sustainability of the pension system (Box 3). Moreover, it would reduce labor force participation at a time when potential growth is already being threatened by unfavorable demographic trends. Authorities’ views The authorities underscored their commitment to keep the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2017 and to resume consolidation in 2018 to put public debt on a firm downward path. They indicated that no new spending measures would be implemented without first identifying financing through revenue measures or expenditure cuts. In this context, See European Commission Country Report Poland 2016.

They noted that the large share of discretionary government consumption in the budget affords flexibility to cut expenditure over time. They specified a number of initiatives to improve tax administration, including by introducing a clause against tax avoidance (General Anti-Avoidance Rule), reducing the limit on cash transactions between companies, and introducing an integrated IT system to track VAT invoices. They indicated that increasing the PIT tax-free allowance could be introduced as part of a more comprehensive income tax reform, with lost revenues from the higher allowance offset by a more progressive tax regime. The authorities were more optimistic on the timing and magnitude of expected revenue gains from tax administration improvements, as well as on the medium-term macroeconomic assumptions underlying their fiscal projections. They concurred that the proposed reduction in the retirement age could reduce the pension replacement rate, but noted that adjusting parametric conditions for entitlement to retirement would mitigate this impact.

Poland: Fiscal Implications of Demographic Changes Poland’s population is expected to decline and age dramatically over the next 45 years. According to Eurostat projections, the population is expected to decline by 30 percent between 2015 and 2060 following a sharp drop in fertility rates. The old-age dependency ratio is expected to almost triple. Under unchanged policies and given expected demographic trends, average pension replacement rates would need to decline significantly in the long term to sustain the solvency of the defined contribution pension system. According to the European Commission, average replacement rates in Poland are projected to decline by about 25 percentage points to below 30 percent by 2060, despite pension reforms implemented in 2013 to gradually increase the retirement age for both men and women to 67 from 65 and 60, respectively. The projected average replacement rate will be one of the lowest in the EU, increasing the risk of old-age poverty. Maintaining a reasonable replacement rate, in the absence of other parametric changes, will require significant additional fiscal outlays. Keeping the average replacement rate at the 2013 level of 53 percent would increase pension expenditure by nearly 8½ percent of GDP per year by 2060. If the replacement rate is maintained at 40 percent—the minimum recommended by the International Labor Organization—pension expenditure would increase by about 4½ percent of GDP per year by 2060. Reversing the gradual increase in the retirement age could exacerbate the social and fiscal impact of population aging. The replacement rate could drop even further to less than 25 percent. Maintaining the replacement rate at 40 percent, in the absence of other parametric changes, would increase pension expenditure by about 6½ percent of GDP per year by 2060. _________________________________________ The analysis was performed by David Amaglobeli and Wei Shi of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.
