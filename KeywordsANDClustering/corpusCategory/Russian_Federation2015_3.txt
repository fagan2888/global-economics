The difficult economic conditions require a prudent macroeconomic policy response, especially in view of the elevated external risks. Thus, the discussions focused on (i) providing a limited fiscal stimulus in the context of needed medium-term fiscal consolidation; (ii) bringing inflation down to target over the medium term while avoiding overly tight conditions in the short term; (iii) ensuring financial stability; and (iv) advancing structural reforms that can leverage the more competitive exchange rate to rebalance growth.
