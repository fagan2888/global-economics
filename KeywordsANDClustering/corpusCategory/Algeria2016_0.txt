The collapse in oil prices points to the urgent need to reshape Algeria’s growth model Following a devastating civil war in the 1990s, Algeria experienced over a decade of relatively steady growth and social stability. Thanks to rapidly increasing oil prices, it was able to accumulate large fiscal savings and international reserves while paying off most of its debt. However, Algeria did not take advantage of over a decade of high oil prices to overcome the structural shortcomings in its growth model, as the economy remained overly dependent on hydrocarbons and public spending. From 2002 (when oil prices started to rise) until 2014 (when they started to fall), hydrocarbons on average accounted for 98 percent of exports, 69 percent of fiscal revenues, and 36 percent of GDP. Government spending swelled as the authorities granted wage increases and provided employment, social housing, and subsidies—most recently in the wake of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, the public sector remains a dominant actor in the economy through many and often large public enterprises, including in the energy and banking sectors. Indeed, public banks account for 87 percent of total banking assets. With the fall in oil prices, Algeria needs to confront an old challenge with new urgency: how to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons and find new sources of growth that will create jobs for a youthful and fast-growing population.
