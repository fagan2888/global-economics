quality and timeliness of monetary, fiscal, and price data are broadly adequate, although coverage could be improved. Fiscal accounts cover only the central government. Limited data on the public enterprises are available, but qualitative information suggests that some of the largest enterprises are operating at a loss and represent a potential fiscal risk. Data on national accounts, balance of payments, and social indicators also suffer from weaknesses in coverage and consistency. Fund technical assistance, including from the IMF’s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center, is being provided to strengthen statistical data systems. Recent improvements include a launch of a new, updated CPI (Box 4) and publication in the IMF Balance of Payments Statistics yearbook 2013 of Afghanistan’s official balance of payments compiled by the central bank.
