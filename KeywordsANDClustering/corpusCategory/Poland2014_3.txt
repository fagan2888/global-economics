The largely foreign-owned banking system is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid with declining reliance on external funding (Figures 6 and 7). Capital to risk-weighted assets has remained strong, reaching 15.6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2014 (Tier 1 ratio at 14.1 percent), in large part due to retained earnings. Profits have held up and liquidity indicators have remained robust. Reliance on parent funding has declined, on-balance sheet open foreign currency positions have narrowed, and regulatory changes to curb foreign currency credit growth have led to a halt in foreign currency mortgage lending. Nonetheless, a loan-to-deposit ratio above 110 percent and reliance on swaps to fund the legacy stock of foreign currency mortgages could expose the sector to liquidity risks (Table 3). Page 9 Credit expansion is strengthening. Both corporate and consumer credit are expanding, reflecting an increase in demand. In addition, for consumer loans, regulatory changes that eased documentation requirements for small loans and replaced caps on the debt-service-to-income threshold (instead allowing banks to use their internal models) likely helped support the expansion of credit. For small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the de minimis program on government credit guarantees was expanded to cover investment financing. NPLs, at around 8.5 percent of loans, have begun to inch down but appear notably sticky and are still elevated in the corporate sector.
