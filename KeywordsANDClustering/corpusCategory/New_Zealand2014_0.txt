Economic developments. The economic expansion is becoming increasingly embedded and broad-based, with growth exceeding 3 percent in the second half of 2013, somewhat stronger than expected. The drivers include supportive financial conditions, record high export commodity prices, resurgent construction activity related to the Canterbury post-earthquake rebuild and general housing shortages, and a substantial increase in net immigration (text figures). Business and consumer confidence indicators have risen to the highest levels since the global financial crisis. The labor market continues to strengthen with the unemployment rate falling to 6 percent (Figure 1). Strong terms of trade have narrowed the 2013 current account deficit to 3¼ percent of GDP and have contributed to the elevated New Zealand dollar, which continues to hold back growth in the non-agricultural tradeable goods sector. With the high exchange rate damping tradable price inflation, headline inflation has remained below the mid-point of the target band (Figure 2). Nominal wage inflation has so far remained subdued.

Monetary policy. After keeping the policy rate at 2½ percent for almost three years, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) began tightening monetary policy in March 2014 and has raised the policy rate to 3 percent. This makes New Zealand one of the first advanced economies to hike interest rates. The Reserve Bank also indicates that it expects to increase the policy rate steadily over the next two years. Fiscal developments. Supported by healthy output growth the government’s aim of reducing the budget deficit is going according to plan. The deficit is currently projected to decline almost ½ percent of GDOP to less than ½ percent of GDP this year due to restraint in expenditure growth. The plan would reduce public debt from its peak of 26 percent of GDP in 2013 to about After the fiscal stimulus in the aftermath of the financial crisis and two large earthquakes that increased net debt by 15 percent of GDP the government initiated a multiyear plan to improve the structural balance by 6 percent of GDP over the medium term.
