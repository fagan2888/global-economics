The ruling party recently won legislative elections, which gives the authorities a strong mandate to pursue growth-oriented policies. The long-delayed legislative elections held in July 2013 were peaceful, and the ruling party secured two-thirds of the seats. In a sign of policy continuity, the prime minister and most of the cabinet were reappointed. The electoral victory gives the authorities the mandate to pursue policies that, in the view of the public, would enhance economic growth and make it more inclusive. Thus, the authorities’ main policy challenges are to maintain fiscal sustainability, step up investment while maintaining debt sustainability, and meet the public’s strong expectations of sharing the fruits from higher economic growth. Macroeconomic performance has improved from fifteen years of crisis (Figure 1 and Text Table 1). Real economic growth accelerated from almost 4½ in 2010-11 to 5.9 percent in 2012, reflecting dynamism in agriculture, mining, construction, and public works. The recent pace of economic growth reflects in part a recovery from the protracted political, social and economic crisis from the early 1990s through mid-2000s. Togo’s GDP per capita declined by about 17 percent during 1997-2002, and the recovery that started in earnest in 2009 has not yet fully made up for the lost ground. Poverty remains high, at about 60 percent of the population, and growth has not been inclusive, as income distribution worsened during 2006-11. Inflation eased to an average 2.6 percent in 2012, on account of rising staple food production and declining import prices following a pick-up in 2011 due to adjustments in energy prices. The current account deficit widened in 2011-12 to 11.8 percent of GDP, primarily as a result of higher imports of fuels and goods for public and private investment. Text Table 1.

Goals Halve Halt/reverse Page 7 Most of the staff advice in the context of the 2011 Article IV consultation remains relevant today (Box 1). Wide ranging structural reforms and fiscal conservatism were implemented up until the HIPC completion point in December 2010. Revenue and public financial management (PFM) reforms have slowed and debt management has weakened since then. The financial sector strategy was approved but its implementation remains limited. Only two out of four banks have been privatized and actions are needed to tackle vulnerabilities in other banks. Reforms in the mining, telecommunications, and energy sectors have progressed slowly under resistance from vested interests. More recently, the Ministry of Economy and Finance approved a public financial management (PFM) reform plan and its implementation has started to bear fruits. Box 1. Main Recommendations from the 2011 Article IV Consultations Staff emphasized the following areas as key to maintain macroeconomic stability, sustain growth, and reduce poverty in the medium term:  Adopt and implement the financial sector development strategy and speed up bank privatization.  Strengthen public financial management.  Improve debt management capacity and adopt a financing strategy relying on highly concessional loans and grants.  Reform the phosphate, telecommunication and energy sectors, where state-owned enterprises dominate. The World Bank plays a key support role in this area. Improve the business environment and boost investment in physical and human capital  ____________________ Since mid-2011, authorities took some steps to reform these sectors. In mining, Togo became a full member of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the authorities are now trying to identify a consortium that could develop the new deposits of carbonated phosphates. In the telecom sector, a new Telecommunication Act was approved, opening the sector to more competition. In the electricity sector, a new Managing Director of the state-owned distribution company was selected following a competitive process in December 2011. Economic growth is expected to soften to around 5½ in 2013. Even though growth has been supported by the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction sectors, economic activity was somewhat affected by irregular rains in mid-2013, lackluster transit trade (in part due to resumption of normal activity in other regional ports), and political uncertainties earlier in the year (Figure 2). The current account deficit would improve slightly to 10.6 percent of GDP, because of lower global import prices. In the medium term, growth is expected to rebound to about 6 percent a year (Figure 3), under the impulse of regional growth and trade, more public and private investments in infrastructure, FDI in mining, and the impact of earlier reform in cash crop markets. The primary domestic fiscal balance would become positive to anchor reductions in the debt burden, and the overall fiscal balance would gradually be reduced to limit new debt accumulation. However, mainly reflecting imports of investments and intermediate goods, the current account deficit is projected to remain high, only narrowing to 9.2 percent of GDP by 2016. Page 8 Figure 2.

Local and presidential elections in 2014 and 2015, respectively, could generate policy slippages; entrenched interests may resist reforms; and limited capacity may slow policy implementation. Without prompt corrective action to address emerging weaknesses in the financial sector, macroeconomic stability could be undermined. Continued policy inaction in the energy sector could negatively affect growth and the budget, while ill-conceived public-private partnerships could entail fiscal liabilities. Given its openness, the economy is vulnerable to shocks in export demand due to growth slowdown among its trading partners.
