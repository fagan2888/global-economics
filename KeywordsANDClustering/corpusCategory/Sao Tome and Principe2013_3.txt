Discussions centered on the need to maintain fiscal prudence in the run-up to the 2014 local and parliamentary elections, and to formulate an appropriate policy response to more uncertain oil prospects. There was agreement that fiscal rectitude should be maintained and the fiscal policy stance tightened gradually over the medium term given the high risk of debt distress and more limited availability of non-debt-creating financing in the absence of oil. The authorities stressed that efforts to strengthen monetary liquidity management and supervisory and regulatory oversight over the financial sector would be stepped up, and that the central bank would work with commercial banks to increase the systemâ€™s efficiency, profitability, and resilience.
