Exports and investment drove a strong recovery in 2014 and indicators suggest solid momentum into 2015. Property prices are bouncing back sharply despite low credit growth, driven in part by international investment. Some crisis legacies are beginning to heal, including unemployment, private balance sheets and bank health, yet substantial nonperforming loans remain to be resolved. Ireland’s economic recovery is starting to fire on all cylinders . Real GDP rose by 4.9 percent y/y in Q1–Q3 2014, with net exports generating two-thirds of this expansion and investment being the other main contributor. The export surge partly reflects offshore manufacturing under contract, contributing perhaps as much as 2 percentage points to growth (Box 1). Ireland’s export performance was strong even excluding this factor, benefitting from U.S. and U.K. trade linkages and improved competitiveness (Annex I).

Page 6 Box 1. Contract Manufacturing and Trade Performance in 2014 In 2014, multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in Ireland made greater use of offshore manufacturing under contract As a base for many of the large pharmaceutical and information technology companies operating in Europe, Ireland is highly exposed to the fragmentation of the global supply chain. As depicted in this chart, the booking of export sales in Ireland sometimes reflects a more complex process whereby products are manufactured in a country A subsidiary, packaged in country B and sold to country C customers, while generating royalty payments to country D for use of intellectual property. Goods produced through contracted manufacturing agreements are treated differently in the national accounts than in customs measures of trade . As these goods do not cross the Irish border, they are not included in customs data on exports. If, however, the goods remain under the ownership of the Irish company, they are recorded as exports in the national accounts. Payments for manufacturing services and patent and royalty payments are service imports in the national accounts, offsetting in part the positive GDP impact of contracted manufacturing. Contracted manufacturing appears to have had a significant impact on GDP growth in 2014 although it is difficult to make a precise estimate . Customs data on goods exports rose by 2.8 percent y/y in volume terms in the first nine months of 2014. In contrast, national accounts data on exports rose 12 percent in the same period. The gap between these two export measures can be attributed in part to contracted production, but could also reflect other factors like warehousing (goods produced in Ireland but stored and sold overseas) and valuation effects. Assuming conservatively that contract manufacturing accounted for about half of the difference between customs and national accounts data, the implied gross contribution to GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2014 from contract manufacturing is 2 percentage points. However, there is a need to take into account the likelihood that service imports were higher than otherwise, but it is not possible to identify the volume of additional service imports linked to contract manufacturing. 04812160481216National AccountsCustoms Trade Data Exports Imports Goods Trade, 2014Q1-Q3 (Percent change, y/y) Source: Central Statistics Office of Ireland. Page 7 The pickup in investment and employment that began in H2 2012 is starting to be supported by consumption, with retail sales excluding autos up 3.6 percent y/y in 2014 (Figure 1). The revival of consumption is underpinned by improving labor market conditions and low inflation Employment is up 5.2 percent from its Q3 2012 trough, bringing the unemployment rate down to 10.4 percent in Q4 2014 from a peak of 15.1 percent. The number of long-term unemployed persons is down by 37 percent from peak, reducing the share of long-term unemployed by 7 percentage points to a still high 56 percent. Labor compensation rose by a strong 6½ percent y/y in the year ended Q3 2014, helping lift household disposable incomes by just over 3 percent. The fall in energy prices is also supporting households’ purchasing power. Property markets are bouncing back rapidly from their lows but valuations do not yet appear stretched: Commercial property values and rents are rising rapidly, in part reflecting international investments Capital values rose 30.7 percent y/y in Q4 2014, the fastest growth since 1999, although price levels are still 56 percent below peak and still about 30 percent below pre-boom levels. Rental growth of 19.7 percent y/y was largely driven by strong demand for Dublin office space reflected in falling vacancy rates and a 31 percent y/y increase in office rents. From almost 10 percent in early 2012, initial rental yields on commercial property have declined substantially to 6 percent in Q4 2014, yet they are still somewhat above the 5.2 percent yield in the U.K., and the premium over the 0.84 percent yield on 10-year government bonds remains sizable. The volume of turnover in Irish commercial real estate in 2014 was higher than in the mid 2000s, with 37.5 percent from offshore investors. 1995Q41998Q42001Q42004Q42007Q42010Q42013Q4 Capital value Rental value Initial yield (percent, RHS) Commercial Real Estate Value Indices and Initial Yield (Index, 1995Q4=100) Source: Investment Property Databank; and Central Bank of Ireland.

Page 8 House prices rose as fast as in the boom during 2014, with mortgage lending starting to pick up from low levels Nationally, prices rose by 16.3 percent y/y in 2014, bringing the rise from the trough in early 2013 to 27 percent. Yet, price levels are still some 38 percent below peak and remain in line with historical norms on standard valuation ratios. Expectations of further appreciation may be deferring sales, contributing to house shortages in Dublin. Mortgage credit has not driven the house price rebound, with about half of transactions in cash, but mortgage loan approvals have risen sharply more recently (Figure 2). Investment is reviving but remains low by historical standards, with residential construction recovery modest to date . Investment (excluding aircraft orders and intangibles) in the year to Q3 2014 was up almost 40 percent from two years earlier, led by a rise in machinery and equipment spending. But the ratio of investment to GDP, at 16 percent, is still well below its 22 percent pre-boom average, primarily reflecting low construction. While house completions rose by 33 percent y/y in 2014, they remain just under one-half of estimated household formation needs. Rising house prices are making new construction more profitable, yet high costs appear to be slowing the supply response together with developers’ depleted equity and their slow transition to using external equity financing. Household balance sheets are healing gradually, yet loan distress remains high and over half of arrears cases are prolonged: Households have cut nominal debts by 20 percent from peak through repayments primarily funded by a 4 percentage point rise in their trend savings rate. Debt ratio falls have been large by international standards but debt levels remain relatively high at 177 percent of disposable income. Household net worth has risen 25 percent from its trough (Figure 2). 0102030400102030402005Q42007Q42009Q42011Q42013Q4 Machinery&equipment ex. aircraft Other construction Residential investment Intangible (R&D) and aircraft Fixed Investment Components (EUR billions, 4-quarter rolling sum, constant prices)Source: Central Statistics Office of Ireland. 2000Q12002Q12004Q12006Q12008Q12010Q12012Q12014Q1 Household Debt Sources: BEA;BIS; CBI; CSO; INE; ONS; RBNZ; and Haver Analytics.

Page 9 A recent survey finds household debts concentrated among families with mortgages, having 2 to 3 children, with the reference person aged 35 to 44, and in the two top income quintiles. Yet, their debt servicing burden is still similar to other groups, reflecting the high share of long-term “tracker” mortgages, with an average interest rate of 1.05 percent at end 2014. The share of mortgages on primary dwellings in arrears for over 90 days declined to 14.8 percent in Q4 2014, from a peak of 17.3 percent five quarters earlier (Figure 2). Staff estimates that some 4.4 percent of households have mortgages in arrears. However, prolonged arrears (over 720 days) rose to just over half of mortgages in arrears over 90 days, with arrears outstanding on these mortgages accounting for 78 percent of total arrears over 90 days. In the case of buy-to-let property, mortgages in arrears remain exceptionally high at 29.4 percent of loans. (Box 1 in the Second PPM report provides further details.) Rising earnings of Irish enterprises appear to be limiting their needs for external financing at this stage in the recovery In the year to Q3 2014, Irish private enterprises (excluding financial intermediaries) repaid outstanding credit at double-digit rates while building deposits at similar rates, indicating a strong cash flow position (see Box 2 in the Second PPM report), consistent with recent surveys finding that SMEs are making fewer loan requests. SMEs also see greater willingness of banks to lend and face lower loan rejection rates. Yet in the second half of 2014, lending rates for SMEs moved up from the median in the euro area to the 75 th percentile— where they were pre-crisis. This could reflect a combination of reduced competition, pricing for higher risk on those SMEs that need to borrow, and a shift from financing of working capital toward lending for investment. Some 25.4 percent of SME loans are in default, but 41.2 percent by value given high default rates on larger loans. Bank health is benefiting from favorable funding conditions and property market recovery yet challenges remain in loan resolution and the transition to Basel III: Domestic banks returned to profitability in the first half of 2014 for the first time since 2008 and reports show continued improvements . Operating income growth reflected a fall in costs on both deposits and market funding. Provisioning expenses fell by two-thirds in 2014 H1 as impaired assets stabilized and increases in property prices also contributed. These trends continued for the full year based on financial reporting by AIB and BoI. Though declining, NPLs remain very elevated at one-quarter of outstanding loans . By Q2 2014 NPLs had fallen 12 percent from their peak in Q3 2013, largely as a result of write-offs and disposals.

Capital adequacy has risen but the transition to Basel III capital rules will require action CET1 ratios of domestic banks averaged a strong 13.4 percent in June 2014, although this partly reflects lower risk weighted assets due to loan repayments. However, Irish banks have significant balance sheet items—such as deferred tax assets and preference shares—that will, under CRD IV, be netted out from equity in the calculation of the capital adequacy ratio after transition periods of some years.
