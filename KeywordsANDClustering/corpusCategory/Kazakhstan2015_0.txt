Like other countries in the region, Kazakhstan was hit in 2014 by large external shocks that are expected to be mostly long lasting. Against the backdrop of these shocks, economic growth has decelerated sharply, financial conditions have tightened, and external imbalances are emerging. While both oil prices and the Russian ruble are off their respective lows reached at end- 2014, improvements in sentiment are tempered by the realization that low oil prices and uncertainties surrounding the Russian economy are likely to persist. The authorities’ large stimulus package has helped blunt the initial impact of the shocks, but recovery will likely be gradual. The stimulus package (“Nulrly Zhulu”), which went into effect in 2014 and which involves public investment programs supported by multilateral development banks (MDBs), is partially offsetting the impact of the shocks. The stimulus is enhanced by a structural reform program aimed at improving the business climate and public sector efficiency. However, the extent of the shocks, the appreciation of the tenge in real effective terms, and a weak lending environment could reduce the prospects for quick economic recovery. At the same time, Kazakhstan’s upcoming accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) could provide a boost to investor confidence. President Nazarbayev won early elections overwhelmingly, and has suggested devolving power to the parliament and the regions. The elections took place on April 26, 2015 (previously scheduled in 2016). The President won reelection with 98 percent of the vote, and has signaled his interest in strengthening the role of parliament in decision making, including speeding up the process of transferring new powers to parliament and, through it, to the prime minister. The “100 steps” reform program announced by the President shortly after his reelection includes a strong emphasis on decentralization and strengthening the rule of law.
