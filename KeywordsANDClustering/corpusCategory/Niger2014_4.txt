Program performance was mixed, partly reflecting the impact of external shocks . All PCs were met at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014, except that on domestic financing, which was missed at both test dates on account of unexpected security and food expenditures and a shortfall in external financing (Tables 6, 7). At end-December 2013 all ITs were met, except the floor on poverty reduction. For end June-2014, the ITs on the basic fiscal balance and total revenues were missed as the budget responded to adverse security shocks, underperformance of customs revenues, and lower donor support. The floor on poverty reduction spending was also missed. This missed IT mainly reflects the reorientation of spending to address pressing security needs as well as a shortfall in external financing.
