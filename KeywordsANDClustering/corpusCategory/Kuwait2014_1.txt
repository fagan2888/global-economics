Economic activity picked up in 2014. Non-oil growth is projected to increase to 3.5 percent in 2014 from an estimated 2.8 percent in 2013, driven by a combination of continued increase in domestic consumption and some pick- up in government capital spending and private investment. Flat oil production in 2014 would keep the overall real GDP growth positive at 1.3 percent. The average inflation rate is forecast to remain at about 3 percent in 2014. The current account surplus is expected to remain high at about 38 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 5). A fiscal surplus of 26 percent of GDP is projected in 2014 supported by high oil prices, but with increases in salaries and subsidies it will be down from about 35 percent in 2013. Wages and salaries constitute 50 percent of total expenditure in the FY 2014/15 budget. Total spending is projected to rise by 25 percent in the budget, reflecting both increased current (22 percent) and capital expenditures (45 percent) (Figures 1 and 6). Figure 1. Fiscal Indicators Monetary conditions have been accommodative. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) benchmark discount rate remained unchanged since October 2012 at 2 percent. The weighted-average deposit and lending rates fell to 1.49 percent and 4.35 percent, respectively, at Kuwait’s exchange rate regime is a conventional peg to a basket.

As total deposits increased by 6.5 percent y-o-y in June 2014, excess liquidity of the banking system—bank reserves at the central bank—has been rising as well. Bank credit to private sector grew y-o-y by 7 percent in June 2014, driven mainly by personal loans (Figure 7). Bank lending to non-bank financial institutions further contracted to 5 percent of banks’ total credit portfolio in June 2014, compared to 6.3 percent a year ago and the pre-crisis boom of 12.7 percent in mid-2008.
