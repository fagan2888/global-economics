SOCIAL DECLINE Despite oil wealth, economic growth for most of the past 15 years has been lackluster and has not been inclusive. Real GDP growth averaged less than 1 percent in the decade through 2009 (Figure 1). As a result, despite relatively high per capita GDP (US$11,100 in 2013), one third of the population remains below the poverty line and (formal) unemployment is at 20 percent. While the political environment has remained stable, weak institutions and governance, a shallow financial sector, and a poor business environment have been obstacles to transforming the oil wealth into better living conditions for the population. Against this backdrop, President Ali Bongo Ondimba launched in 2010 an ambitious plan to transform Gabon into an emerging and diversified economy by 2025, underpinned by a large US$12 billion public investment program.

The plan’s objectives are to: (i) significantly accelerate economic growth and diversify its sources away from oil; (ii) improve social indicators by having more inclusive and job-rich growth; and (iii) ensure sustainable management of natural resources for future generations. The two main pillars of the strategy are to improve the level and quality of infrastructure, and to raise the quality of human capital. Despite its upper middle-income country status, Gabon fares poorly in areas that are critical to the success of the PSGE. Figure 2 and Text Table 1 compare Gabon to other emerging economies on several indicators, including the business environment and financial market Page 6 development. As seen in Figure 2, Gabon ranks considerably lower than its comparators in most determinants of competitiveness, and does poorly in basic aspects such as infrastructure, health, and education. Comparisons of financial indicators show that emerging countries have considerably more financial depth and market access than Gabon (Text Table 1). Figure 2.

Gabon is the second largest economy in the CEMAC monetary and economic union, and its policies have significant spillover effects to the union . This is notably the case regarding the accumulation of external reserves, since Gabon’s large oil wealth is a major source of foreign exchange to the union. Representing over one fifth of CEMAC’s nominal GDP, the evolution of the Gabonese economy is bound to have significant effects over the rest of the region. Furthermore, a successful, fiscally sustainable implementation of Gabon’s diversification plan would not only be a valuable model for other countries in the region that are aiming to foster non-oil growth, but the resulting improvement in Gabon’s roads and telecommunications infrastructure could foster the region’s integration This report uses the IMF’s WEO definition of emerging market economies. The main criteria used by the WEO to classify emerging markets are: (1) per capita income level; (2) export diversification; and (3) degree of integration into the global financial system.
