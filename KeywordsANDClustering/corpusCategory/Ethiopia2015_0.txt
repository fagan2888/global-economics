Safeguards Assessment The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was subject to an update safeguards assessment with respect to the ESF arrangement approved on August 26, 2009. The updated assessment found improved financial reporting and internal audit practices. Notwithstanding these developments, the assessment noted significant weakness. Recommendations focused on strengthening oversight of risks and controls, improving accounting records and the external audit process, and legal amendments to address safeguards weakness in the Law. As of now, some progress has been reported on the outstanding safeguards recommendations, particularly in the area of operations of audit committee and staff training. Staff has recently received audited financial statements for the previous years together with the management letters issued by the NBE’s external auditor. A full set of audited financial statements should also be made available to the public, and published on the NBE’s website. Exchange Rate Arrangement The de-facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The authorities describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The pace of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, however, has been stable. The NBE continues to supply foreign exchange to the interbank market based on plans prepared at the beginning of each fiscal year, which take into account estimates of supply and demand. The transaction-weighted average interbank market exchange rate as of August 13, 2015, was Br 20.6698 = US$1. The assessment, completed on December 2009, followed up on an initial safeguards assessment from September 2001. Page 44 Ethiopia maintains four restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and other investment income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from the NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain unapproved. Article IV Consultation Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No, 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The last consultation was concluded on September 24, 2014.
