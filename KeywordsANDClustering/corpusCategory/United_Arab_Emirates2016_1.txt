Non-oil economic activity has slowed. Amid lower oil prices non-hydrocarbon growth slowed to 3.7 percent in 2015, and declining PMI points also to continued softening of activity in the first months of 2016 (see Figures 1 and 2). The slowdown in 2015 was driven by a contraction of public investment in the context of fiscal consolidation, and lower contribution from domestic private demand as business and consumer confidence weakened and credit to the private sector slowed. The impact on overall growth was partially offset by an increase in oil production. Inflation has eased to 1.4 percent year-over-year by end-March 2016. The fiscal stance was contractionary in 2015 (Figure 3). With frontloaded fiscal consolidation in Abu Dhabi, the adjusted non-hydrocarbon deficit is estimated to have narrowed by 8½ percentage points to 29 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2015, leading to a reduction in the fiscal break-even oil price to about $60 in 2015 from $79 in 2014. In terms of its composition, the authorities scaled back capital transfers to GREs, cut government investment, raised electricity and water tariffs, and removed fuel subsidies. Despite these measures, the overall fiscal balance turned to a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP due to lower oil prices. The deficit was mainly financed by drawing down government deposits. The current account surplus declined sharply in 2015 to 3.3 percent of GDP from 10 percent in 2014, due to lower oil and gas prices (Figure 5). Nonhydrocarbon exports remained resilient. The tourism sector continued to expand in 2015, but at a slower pace. Foreign direct investment remained steady and net foreign inflows increased significantly, driven by banks’ foreign borrowing. As a result, the overall external balance improved and gross international reserves at the CBU increased to USD 94 billion in 2015 from 78.5 billion in 2014. The REER appreciated by 9.5 percent in 2015, due mainly to the stronger U.S. dollar, to which the Dirham is pegged, and higher relative price inflation in the UAE, before edging down 1.5 percent year-to- date by end-March 2016. Due to its large external buffers, pressures on the peg were limited with the 3-month forward implied yield at 0.78 bps on April 29, the lowest in the GCC region. Banks remained well capitalized, but profitability pressures have emerged. Domestic deposit growth has slowed significantly to 1.8 percent y-o-y at end–March 2016, reflecting lower government deposits. This has led to increased wholesale foreign funding (up to 11.8 percent of banks’ liabilities by end–March 2016 from a 10.4 percent a year ago, mostly dollar-denominated and with an average maturity of about 2.6 years) to finance slowing but still robust domestic credit growth at 7.6 percent y-o-y at end-March 2016. Lending standards have tightened, though to a lesser extent in the first quarter of 2016 (Figures 1 and 4). Nevertheless, banking liquidity is still comfortable with an overall liquid asset ratio of 20.7 percent by end-March 2016. Banks remained well capitalized, though NPLs rose slightly to 5.3 percent by end-March, notably for SMEs, while NPL coverage by provisions remains at 108 percent. With slower deposit growth The authorities moved in July 2015 toward market-based pricing of gasoline and diesel, but fiscal gains have been limited as international prices further declined to below pre-reform domestic prices. Page 11 than loan growth and with the U.S. interest rate hike in December, interbank rates increased in 2015, and higher costs of funding and weaker asset quality could weigh on profitability in 2016. Overall, financial risks in the banking sector were still moderate at the end of the first quarter of 2016 as banks’ balance sheets remained strong and the credit to non-oil GDP gap is estimated to have remained negative (see Figure 1 FSI heat map). Real estate prices have continued to decline, but the quality of the real estate loan portfolio has remained resilient. Structural measures taken in 2014, such as the tightening of industry self-regulation, higher real estate fees, and tighter macroprudential regulation for mortgage lending, have helped contain speculative demand for real estate and led to declining prices. This trend has continued with Dubai’s real estate average residential prices falling by 11 percent in 2015, also reflecting oversupply and strong headwinds on demand. In Abu Dhabi where the supply growth slowed, they fell by 0.8 percent. However, these developments do not appear to pose systemic risks for the financial sector, as the nonperforming loans for construction and real estate development declined from 12.3 percent in 2013 to 7.5 percent by end-March 2016. Similar improvements have been experienced for loans to households with NPLs ratio down from 10 to 4.9 percent over the same period. GREs have continued to deleverage. Several GREs actively managed their debt, making early repayments and lengthening maturity profiles. Nonetheless, the GREs debt servicing capacity remains limited with an average interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 2 as of end-June 2015. In addition, total public debt in Dubai continued to be significant at 126.2 percent of Dubai GDP in 2015, large maturities are due by 2018, and net debt of GREs with an ICR lower than 1.5 was estimated at about U.S. $20 billion at end-June 2015. In Abu Dhabi, GREs have substantially reduced their debt. Page 12 Figure 1.
