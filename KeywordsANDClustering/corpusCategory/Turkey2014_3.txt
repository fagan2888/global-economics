SAVINGS The macroeconomic policy mix should focus on bringing down the external imbalance and lowering inflation to reduce vulnerabilities and preserve competitiveness. The preferred adjustment is through higher domestic savings to preserve investment (Box 4). Current macroeconomic policies do not support such adjustment. Staff hence advises tighter fiscal and monetary policies in the near term to achieve higher domestic savings and lower inflation, while using macroprudential policies to preserve financial sector resilience. To the extent that fiscal policy is tighter, the burden on monetary policy would be reduced. The current international environment provides a potentially brief window of opportunity for such adjustment, which should therefore not be delayed.
