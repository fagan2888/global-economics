Policy discussions focused on near-term challenges and a medium-term policy framework to support PNDES objectives . The immediate challenge is to overcome deep-seated bottlenecks and accelerate execution of public investment, while tilting the composition of the budget away from recurrent expenditure and towards productive investment in human and physical capital. At the same time, inadequate energy supply, lack of economic diversification and low access to credit are hindering private sector development and job creation. Accordingly, the Article IV Page 13 BURKINA FASO consultationâ€™s two policy themes were how to create fiscal space to enable a sustainable scaling up of public investment, and how to support structural transformation and inclusive growth. The mission organized an outreach event to present analytical background work on investment scaling up, options to contain the wage bill and the drivers of financial inclusion in Burkina Faso. The event allowed for a frank exchange of views with a broad cross-section of the administration. Previous Article IV discussions focused on similar issues and the authorities have made progress in implementing past recommendations in spite of disruptions associated with the political transition . Positive outcomes include continued reduction in inequality and poverty, the adoption of the 2015 Mining Code, and implementation of external audit recommendations by the two state-owned energy companies (Table 9).
