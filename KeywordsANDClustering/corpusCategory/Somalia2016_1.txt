The Somali economy is expected to continue to be sustained by donors’ grants, remittances, and investment by the Somali diaspora. Reflecting a looming drought, economic activity is expected to slow down, with inflation projected to pick up in 2016–17. Risks are tilted to the downside, emanating mainly from weak institutions and fiscal performance, and the fragile security situation. Economic activity is projected to decelerate in 2016–17, but will continue to be sustained by donors’ grants, remittances, and Somali diaspora investment (Table 1 and Text Table 1). Economic growth recovered in 2014–15 and inflation was low. Growth is projected to be 3.4 percent in 2016 and 2–2.5 percent in 2017. The projected slower growth rate mainly reflects the impact of the drought on the agriculture sector which will be partially offset by growing activity in the construction, telecommunications, and service sectors. Meanwhile, due in part to higher food prices, inflation is projected to pick up to 2.7–3 percent in 2017, up from 1.5 percent in 2016. The trade deficit (56 percent of GDP on average in 2014–15), which is projected to remain sizable, will be largely financed by remittances and grants. And, the current account deficit (8.6 percent of GDP on average in 2014–15) will be largely covered by foreign direct investment, mostly by the Somali diaspora. Fiscal strains deepened in the lead up to the presidential elections (Table 2a and 2b). Budgetary grants and Data for 2016 are still projections and the figures are subject to changes. With support from Sweden, the World Bank, and the IMF, the GDP estimates for 2012-15 and the CPI (weighting scheme) are expected to be updated and completed in 2017. The share of agriculture is more than 25 percent of GDP. (continued) 2014201520162017Proj.Proj.

Est. Page 12 tax revenue are projected to fall short in 2016, reflecting delayed disbursement and weak performance, respectively. Meanwhile, expenditures on goods and services increased, in part due to the presidential elections and security spending. To maintain the fiscal balance at zero (on cash basis), the authorities opted to delay some salary payments for November and December. The Central Bank of Somalia (CBS) is slowly resuming its activities (Table 3). Available data indicate that the gross assets of the CBS declined slightly between December 2015 and September 2016, largely reflecting the drop in cash held in vaults (from $13.3 million in December to $9.8 million). Currently, there is no scope for monetary policy in Somalia and the CBS has no control over either the exchange rate or the supply of the Somali shilling (SOS). The CBS has not issued any banknotes since 1991, resulting in a largely dollarized economy. The Somali Shilling/U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained stable (at about SOS 23,000 per U.S. dollar) since April 2016. The financial sector is being revived . The Somali financial sector is rudimentary with limited intermediation. It consists of six commercial banks—which mainly act as money exchange and trade financing institutions for their owners—and 12 Money-Transfer Business (MTBs). In June 2016, the total assets of the six licensed commercial banks reached $214 million, up from $170 million 12 months prior, an increase of 26 percent. Bank capitalization increased sharply by an average of 24 percent. However, two out of the six banks representing See ¶13–staff views on arrears and delayed payments. The decline during this period reflects, in part, the theft of $530,000 in August 2016 (see ¶20–21). Payments are settled in U.S. dollars, mobile phone platforms, and counterfeit SOS banknotes. Some intermediations have started recently and banks are also beginning to make more Islamic investments. There are 12 licensed MTBs, and 4 registered MTBs that are operating in Somalia. The MTBs provide international money transfer service, generally to households, and in many cases act as quasi-bank by providing financial services to handful of the population. Recent assessment of MTBs compliance carried out by the Trusted Agent (Box 1) found that MTBs are not fully implementing the existing compliance and their policies and practices are yet to be consistent with the regulations. All but one bank meet the minimum capital requirement of $5 million. Commercial banking activity is geographically concentrated in Mogadishu, with each institution having only a few branches in other parts of the country, typically engaged in money transfers and trade finance. An additional 13 applications for commercial bank licenses are pending. (continued) Page 13 about 12 percent of total assets have been reporting negative income, suggesting caution for pockets of vulnerabilities on their solvency. Bank loans—both in the forms of Islamic investment and traditional loans— increased on an annual basis to $51.4 million in June 2016 from $42.2 million in June 2015, a 22 percent increase. The authorities agreed that the outlook is subject to significant domestic and external risks , stemming from both global uncertainties and weaknesses in domestic factors (as detailed in the Risk Assessment Matrix–RAM, Box 2). External risks include spillovers from the protracted conflicts in the Middle East which could weaken demand for Somali exports, reduce donor support, and decrease remittances. Tighter international regulatory and supervisory frameworks could also further slow remittances. Domestic risks include the loss of expenditure control and slowdown in reform implementation in the run-up to the presidential elections, which could weaken the fiscal position, in particular revenue collection; weak institutional capacity, which could undermine critical reforms to mobilize revenues and public financial management; drought conditions in some key regions of Somalia; repeated delays in the electoral process, which could compromise donors’ support to the FGS; fragile security; and poor financial system supervision, including the need to strengthen compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in line with international standards. MTBs activities remain strong. The gross inflows to Somalia in 2015 through MTBs were estimated at 14.6 percent of GDP. Staff has shared and discussed the RAM with the authorities.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline outlook (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of Fund staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability of 10-30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern at the time of discussions with authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. Page 15
