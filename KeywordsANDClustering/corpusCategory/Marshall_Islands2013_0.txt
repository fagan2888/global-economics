The RMI is a small and isolated country, with a dispersed population and limited export base, highly dependent on external aid and vulnerable to climate change. Under the renewed Compact Agreement with the US, the RMI will continue to receive annually declining grants averaging US$45 million (26 percent of GDP as of FY2012) until FY2023. A Compact Trust Fund (CTF) is being built up to provide funding from FY2024 onwards.
