Resolving the conflict requires political inclusion. Violence has continued in conflict- affected areas despite frequent negotiations between the government and rebels and the signing of cessation of hostilities agreements. A peace process sponsored by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (comprising Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda) has been under way since early 2014, and pressure has intensified on all parties to bring about peace, yet prospects are uncertain. The authorities expect that a dialogue within the ruling party comprising those in the government, former Vice-President Machar, and those that signaled their dissent in 2013, would result in a political settlement and a government of national unity in 2015.
