The balance of risks has improved but is still to the downside. The interaction of external and domestic downside risks must remain the main policy concern. The momentum of the recovery could be stronger, as recent terms-of-trade improvements could boost business confidence and commodity production if they are more persistent than expected. On the downside, growth could be slower, as consumption growth could remain lackluster with continued low wage growth and high incidence of part-time work, and profits could remain under pressure for longer with increased competition and relatively persistent slack. On the external side, there are risks to global trade from rising populism and nationalism in large economies and from tighter and more volatile global financial conditions. A major concern for macro-financial risk management is that external risks could hit both traditionally exposed sectors (commodity prices and exports) and new sources of growth (e.g., services exports), for example, a sharper growth slowdown in China (Annex Vâ€”Risk Assessment Matrix). If such external risks materialized, they could interact with or even trigger domestic risks, especially a sharp housing market correction, also given that annual approvals for all non-residents applying to purchase residential property have substantially increased to around 20 percent of overall turnover value, and they could lead to external funding pressure for banks.
