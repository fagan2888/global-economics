Economic activity is slowly recovering. Real GDP expanded by an estimated 1 percent in on the back of increased tourist arrivals, but growth remains well below pre-global crisis levels (the level of real GDP also remains below its pre-crisis peak). Supported, in part, by rising U.S. economic activity, air arrivals grew by almost 5 percent in 2014 and applied room rates improved by 7 percent. Domestic demand has been weighed down by the weak macroeconomic outlook, high household indebtedness, and high unemployment which stood at 15.7 percent in November 2014. Inflation rose to 2.2 percent in January 2015 (1.2 percent in December 2014), as the imposition of the value added tax (VAT) offset the effects of declining oil prices. The fiscal deficit in FY 2013/14 (July to June) is estimated to have narrowed to 3.3 percent of GDP (from 5.4 percent ) Revenue was lower-than-budgeted, but a substantial reduction in current spending, including on wages and salaries, and on goods and services resulted in an overall fiscal deficit below budget target. The debt-GDP-ratio is estimated to have reached 61 percent in FY2013/14 from 56 percent in FY2012/13. Key public enterprises including Bahamasair, Bahamas Electricity Corporation (BEC) and the Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) continue to be a drag on government finances. In September 2014, Moody's downgraded The Bahamas' rating one notch to Baa2 citing deterioration of the government's balance sheet and subdued economic growth. The external current account continues to record sizable deficits. Reflecting the large import components of the Baha Mar resort project, the external current account deficit surged to 22 percent of GDP in 2014. The investment/GDP ratio remains in excess of 25 percent of GDP, and an improved fiscal position has raised the rate of public saving, albeit overwhelmed by an implied reduction in the private saving rate (Figure 4). Foreign financial inflows, including government borrowing, are estimated, however, to have helped cushion reserve losses. The real and nominal GDP data for 2010–2014 were revised in March 2015, which affected staff’s macroeconomic projections and outlook for 2015–2020.

Page 10 Traditional external competiveness indicators do not unambiguously indicate real effective exchange rate (REER) misalignment . A simple average of the three methodologies used suggests an improvement in competitiveness, albeit under 10 percent, would be needed to close the external current account balance. On the other hand, The Bahamas’ share of Caribbean tourism arrivals has been stable recently with upside prospects from the opening of Baha Mar and other FDI-financed investments (Figure 3, Annex 2). Nonetheless, the mixed picture suggests that enhancing competitiveness including through structural reforms remains a priority. External reserves remain low. Reserves totaled US$839 million at end-March 2015, equivalent to 2.3 months of next year’s projected imports of goods and services. However, this reflects, in part, a net purchase of US$175 million from the government following an external bond placement early last year (Box 1). The domestic banking system’s deleveraging process continues but the sector remains well capitalized and liquid. Net domestic assets declined by 2.6 percent through December 2014 with private sector credit falling back to its 2009 level. Nonperforming loans remain elevated, with 16 percent of total loans overdue by 90 or more days in March 2015. In October 2014, the government established a special purpose company to take over non-performing commercial loans (US$100 million, 1.1 percent of GDP) of a weak state-owned bank. The banking system’s end–2014 capital adequacy, in excess of 33 percent of risk-weighted assets, remains well above the central bank’s 17 percent target. With subdued lending prospects, banks also continue to be liquid (with the liquid/total asset ratio at 23 percent at end–2014).
