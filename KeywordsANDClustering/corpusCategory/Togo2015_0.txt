Output growth averaged 5.4 percent in 2013-14 (Text Table 1; Figure 1). Investor uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections may have dampened economic activity in the secondary and tertiary sectors in 2014 but it was compensated by the strong performance in the agricultural sector, which benefited from a good rainfall and the increased use of fertilizers (see SIP). Inflation slowed mainly due to declining food prices, associated with the good harvest in 2014, and reductions in retail fuel prices, reflecting global oil price trends (see SIP). The current account deficit widened from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 13 percent of GDP in 2013–14, primarily as a result of higher imports of intermediary goods and petroleum products linked to the development of transportation network. Exports failed to compensate the surge of imports in 2014, as equipment constraints slowed down phosphate exploitation, and operational accidents and strikes interrupted the production of clinker and cement (Figure 2). In addition, economic slowdown and large depreciation in the currencies of key trading partners, such as Ghana and Nigeria, diminished the demand for other Togolese exports. The recent pace of economic growth has contributed to improving human development indicators. While real GDP per capita remains below the WAEMU average (Text Figure 1), Togo’s human development index compares well with other WAEMU countries as well as LICs and continues to improve (Text Figure 2). Togo has been making progress towards its Millennium Development Goals (Text Table 2). However, poverty remains high and geographically concentrated in rural areas. The challenge is thus to sustain growth while making it more inclusive. Sources: Togolese authorities and IMF staff estimates and projections. Includes arrears and state-owned enterprises external debt. The Ministry of Agriculture has developed a program (PNIASA) to increase the productivity of the agricultural and cattle sectors, which includes the provision of fertilizers to producers. Technical and labor disruptions continued in early 2015. Income distribution worsened during 2006–11, as measured by the increase of the Gini coefficient from 0.36 to Page 10 Text Figure 1.

Public debt has accumulated very rapidly in recent years, increasing from 46 percent of GDP in 2012 to 58 percent in 2014. Consequently, investment spending and debt service have been putting considerable pressures on the budget and liquidity situation. President Faure Gnassingbé was elected to a third term in April 2015 on a platform centered on continuing to improve economic infrastructure to foster growth, expanding and better targeting social spending, and maintaining security . On infrastructure, the authorities plan to extend the road network beyond the main arteries, resurrect the railways for commercial transport, and develop telecom services. The social program is extensive, spanning education, social transfers, employment programs, health service expansion, universal access to potable water, improved access to energy, and social housing. On the security front, the authorities intend to strengthen the armed forces to play a more prominent role in regional stability. Progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2013 Article IV consultations is mixed (Annex I). Togo was in the top 10 most improved performers in the 2015 ranking of Doing Business Indicators (DBI), mainly reflecting the establishment of a single window for business registration. Revenue administration and PFM reforms are gathering momentum, but debt management remains a weak area. The Treasury Single Account (TSA) is not yet in place, and Page 11 the re-organization of the Ministry of Finance has not started. Operational reforms in revenue administration started in late 2014 and are beginning to contribute to increase in revenue. The privatization program for the remaining two banks under government control has stalled. Parliamentary and presidential elections in 2013 and 2015, respectively, may have played a role in slowing reforms. Staff recommendations, hence, remain largely the same as in the 2013 Article IV consultations.
