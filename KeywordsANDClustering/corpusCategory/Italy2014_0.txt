The economy is struggling to emerge from a deep balance-sheet recession . Real GDP contracted in the first half of 2014 by 0.1 percent compared to second half of last year, pushing Italy back into recession. Exports have held steady, led by demand from non-EU countries, but investment continues to decline and remains 27 percent below pre-crisis levels. Tight credit conditions and weak corporate balance sheets continue to weigh heavily on domestic demand. Moreover, despite the easing fiscal drag, the heavily indebted public sector faces the need of further consolidation. Leading indicators, such as PMI, point to activity expanding in 2014:H2, but at a subdued pace. The combination of weak domestic demand and improving global growth has led to a further narrowing of external imbalances and a modest current account surplus in 2013. Italy’s share of global exports increased for the first time since 2007. Sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly but credit conditions remain tight, holding back investment Composite PMI (Greater than 50 = expansion) Investment and Export Volumes (2008Q1 = 100) Investment Exports Source: Haver. Progress on the EU crisis prevention frameworks, the ECB backstop, and a better fiscal position in Italy have instilled market confidence and reduced sovereign spreads by 320 bps since 2011. The normalization of the sovereign market, however, has failed to transmit to the credit market, where real lending rates shot up to 3 percent as inflation fell and nominal rates barely reacted to accommodative ECB measures (Box 1). The clearance of government arrears (1.6 percent of GDP to date) partly offset tight credit conditions. But, surveys indicate that a large share of the payments was used by firms to repay debt, rather than invest. Page 6 Box 1. Impact of Financial Conditions on Growth Sovereign spreads and market volatility have declined since 2012 but domestic credit conditions have tightened. The former improves financial stability, but the latter holds back growth, mainly through investment Analyzing financial conditions . A Financial Conditions Index (FCI) constructed from a broad set of indicators permits an analysis of the interactions between financial conditions and the real economy. The FCI captures in one summary statistic the information in stock market returns, sovereign spreads, the NEER, inflation expectations, the ECB policy rate and balance sheet, EURIBOR-OIS spread, nominal bank lending rates, credit volume to the private sector (bank loans and bonds), and lending standards (see ECB WP 1541 for details). Negative values indicate tighter than average conditions. Recent developments . The FCI tightened significantly in 2011 and early 2012, but has eased recently on the back of gains in equities and sovereign spreads and stable bank lending standards. However, nominal lending rates to the private sector have remained high, which combined with falling inflation, have driven real lending rates up. The tight conditions despite the ECB’s accommodative stance reflect the persistence of financial fragmentation in the euro area.

Growth impact . Financial conditions are closely correlated with growth and FCI shocks have a significant impact on growth. For example, a bivariate VAR under the identifying assumption that the FCI affects growth with a one-quarter lag suggests that a negative shock that raises real corporate lending rates by 260bps through a 200bps increase in nominal rates and a 60bps decline in inflation expectations (to 0.5 percent), would lower growth by a cumulative 0.4 percentage point over three quarters. As a reference, real rates have increased by around 300 bps since mid-2012. Policy implications . The analysis suggests that measures to normalize corporate financial conditions would support a robust and sustained recovery, mainly through investment. Since bank lending rates account for the lion’s share of the tightening in the FCI, domestic and euro area measures to address financial fragmentation, mend corporate balance sheets, and strengthen banks’ capacity to lend would minimize the risk of a weak, creditless recovery. Caveats . The quantitative results should be interpreted with caution since the model is very parsimonious, identifies shocks in a crude way, and does not capture factors such as fiscal tightening. Moreover, the model cannot disentangle different types of structural shocks, for example, both a productivity shock and an easing in monetary policy raise equity prices. Page 7 The persistent slack has resulted in high unemployment and low inflation The unemployment rate has stabilized around a post-war high of 12.3 percent (another 2 percent of workers in the wage supplementation scheme are not in the official figures but are not working). The high incidence of long-term unemployment (58 percent, 20 points above the OECD average) highlights the difficulty to reemploy workers quickly. Headline inflation dropped to 0.4 percent (y/y) in 2014:Q2, 0.2 percentage points below the euro area rate. Volatile components such as energy explain part of the decline but low core inflation (0.7 percent, y/y) and the nonexistent pass-through of the October 2013 VAT hike suggest that weak demand and the large output gap (3.8 percent) are significant factors. Nominal wages increased 1.4 percent (y/y) in the first quarter as inflation dropped leading to a 0.9 percent real increase. Cross-country experience indicates that low-inflation recoveries with growing real wages are more likely to be jobless (Calvo et al. 2012). The crisis has affected the Italian regions unevenly . GDP fell 6.7 percent in the north over 2007–13, but as much as 13.6 percent in the south. The unemployment rate increased about 4 percentage points more in the south than in the north. Regional differences in institutions and policies help explain the large north-south productivity gap (60 percent) and mixed macroeconomic performance. These differences potentially offer important lessons for reform priorities going forward and are therefore explored in more depth in this report.

The fiscal correction started by earlier governments continued through 2013. Nonetheless, coalition infighting over a controversial property tax put on hold further discussions on needed fiscal and structural reforms. Important reforms of the justice system and labor and product markets have been initiated, but according to the Bank of Italy (BoI), of the 69 reform laws passed over 2011–13, only half of the implementing measures have been issued.
