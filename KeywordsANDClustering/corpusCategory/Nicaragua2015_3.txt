The current policy mix is broadly adequate to maintain macroeconomic stability, but Nicaragua needs to fortify its policy framework in a number of areas to address risks and promote sustained and more equitable growth while enhancing the transparency of its fiscal operations. In particular, the authorities need to build fiscal buffers to keep public debt stable should some of the identified risks materialize and, given the large debt service obligations faced by the private sector, the policy mix should remain guided by the need to reduce risks to external stability.
