Policy discussions focused mainly on the principal challenge facing Lesotho: the ongoing drop in SACU revenues and fiscal adjustment. As highlighted by the Minister of Finance in the 2015/16 budget speech in June, the Lesotho authorities recognize the need for fiscal adjustment to maintain macroeconomic stability, including the necessity to contain the government wage bill. Policy discussions also addressed the need to strengthen Lesothoâ€™s business environment and international competitiveness, so that the private sector can step up as the driving force for job creation and more inclusive growth. Financial sector stability and development issues were also discussed, with a view toward enhancing a sound deepening of financial services and intermediation to support growth. Other issues discussed during the Article IV consultation included debt sustainability and structural reforms, particularly in the area of public financial management (PFM), which would be instrumental for paving the way for longer-term fiscal reforms such as decentralization and a rules-based approach to fiscal policy.
