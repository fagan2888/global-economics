The economy is on a cyclical upswing supported by strong domestic demand . The recent growth pickup was driven mainly by private consumption on the back of recent hikes in minimum and public wages. In addition, record low interest rates, low fuel prices, and a VAT reduction on food items supported consumer confidence and demand (Figure 1). Investment has recently shown some signs of a pickup partly related to a catch-up in EU funds absorption and helped offset a weakening of exports in the second half of the year. Headline inflation has turned negative but underlying inflation—adjusted for recent VAT cuts—is positive and trending up (Figure 4). Annual headline inflation turned negative in Page 10 June 2015 following a sharp reduction in VAT on food items from 24 to 9 percent. However, adjusting for the VAT changes, underlying inflation has remained positive and been rising, despite the recent fall in international commodity prices and low inflation in the euro area. Although headline inflation may decline in the coming months due to indirect effects from the recent fall in oil prices and VAT reduction, pressure is building on underlying inflation due to a closing output gap, fast wage growth, and a strong fiscal impulse (Annex VI and Selected Issues Paper).

Overall wages grew by 11.6 percent (y/y) in January 2016, reflecting public wage and minimum wage hikes. Minimum wage is expected to be raised again to 1,250 lei in May 2016 (about €265) from 1,050 lei. These hikes marked a record high for Romania and are the steepest among European peers since 2000. As these exceeded productivity gains, unit labor costs increased by 2.2 percent in 2015 and by 7.6 percent since 2010.

The general government deficit (on a cash basis) was 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to 1.8 percent in the original budget. Revenues were 1.3 percent of GDP higher than budgeted as higher income taxes, VAT, and social security contributions more than offset lower EU funds absorption and because of a low base in 2014. Total expenditure was 0.9 percent higher mainly due to personnel spending. Public debt stood at around 40 percent at end-2015. Based on preliminary data, the budget recorded a surplus of 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Peer Average 1/ Sources: WEO Live; and IMF staff estimates. 1/ Peer countries include ALB, BIH, BGR, HRV, HUN, UVK, MKD, MNE, POL and SRB.

The current account deficit is small and widened modestly in 2015 . The main drivers of last year’s deficit were the increase in goods trade deficit and the almost doubling of primary income deficit due to estimated reinvested earnings and interest related to government payments. FDI inflows improved moderately due to the reinvestment of earnings and the recovery of the economy. Despite large repayments to the Fund and the EU, gross reserves of €35.5 billion at end- 2015 were broadly adequate by most reserve adequacy metrics (Annex IV). The current account deficit is projected to gradually widen in 2016–17 as domestic demand grows, and reach around 3.5 percent of GDP over the medium term.

Jan-11 Jan-13 Jan-14 Jan-15 Jan-16 Banks’ NPLs have come down markedly and credit is beginning to grow but risks remain . The NPL ratio fell to 14 percent at end-2015 compared to a peak of 22 percent in 2014Q1 reflecting write-offs and sales prompted by the National Bank of Romania’s (NBR) efforts. Credit growth is beginning to turn the cycle, with growth in local currency lending more than offsetting the continued decline in foreign currency lending. The banking system, on average, continues to enjoy comfortable levels of capital adequacy and liquidity, and profitability is improving (Figure 6). Nevertheless, banks remain exposed to credit risk due to FX mismatches in borrowers’ balance sheets and market risk related to large bond holdings. During last summer, four Greek-owned Romanian banks experienced substantial deposit withdrawals. The authorities deftly managed the stress episode and deposit withdrawals have largely been reversed. The NBR has also recently introduced additional capital buffer requirements such as a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer (currently set at zero), a buffer for systemically important institutions, and a systemic risk buffer to enhance the set of macro- prudential tools.
