While partly reflecting deflation-related pressures, the deficit expanded substantially in 2014, breaching fiscal rules. Ambitious adjustment efforts—beyond those already planned— should be considered to support policy credibility, strengthen buffers and reduce medium-term risks. Background The fiscal deficit rose to 3.7 percent of GDP, twice the original budget target (cash basis) . While some overshooting was to be expected given extraordinary deflationary pressures, the deficit increase also reflects a failure to adequately contain expenditure once it became clear that optimistic revenue projections would not materialize: Revenues. Large projected increases in tax collection (based on optimistic assumptions for price levels and efficiency gains, as highlighted in the 2013 Article IV Staff Report) were not realized, with grants also lower than projected. Expenditures. Expenditures were not adjusted to reflect revenue underperformance, while unprogrammed health-related expenditures added to spending pressure. Execution rates for EU-funded investments improved, but reimbursements were temporarily interrupted due to concerns related to procurement procedures and control systems.

Page 14 Costs associated with the banking sector emergency support were fully recorded below the line, with no impact on the 2014 deficit. The expansionary fiscal stance breached the national fiscal rule (cash deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP). Public debt increased sharply in 2014, albeit from low levels . Total public debt rose 9 percentage points to 27 percent of GDP at end-2014, including a EUR 1.5 billion (3.6 percent of GDP) loan raised for state support to the banking sector. The fiscal reserve stood at BGN 8.1 billion on a cash basis at end-2014, well above the year-end minimum—including deposits associated with liquidity support to FIB and partial pre-financing for 2015 (Box 1). On March 20, 2015, Bulgaria successfully placed triple- tranche Eurobonds (7, 12, and 20 years) for €3.1 billion (7.4 percent of GDP), fulfilling the bulk of the 2015 financing requirements. For 2015, the government’s budget targets a 3 percent of GDP headline deficit (cash basis), again above the national rule. This compares to a target of 1.5 percent of GDP in the 2014 Convergence Program. The budget is underpinned by conservative revenue assumptions and entails a reduction in the structural deficit on a cash basis by about 0.8 percent of potential GDP versus 2014 (with this adjustment likely to be substantially smaller on accrual basis). Adjustment is driven mainly by reduction in compensation, health-related transfers, and contingency funds. Further reductions of the headline deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP in each of 2016 and 2017 are programmed. Staff’s views The government’s fiscal strategy recognizes the need to reduce deficits following last year’s slippage, but faster consolidation should be considered. While debt remains relatively low, the recent jump in debt levels is not expected to be corrected under the authorities’ baseline scenario. Moreover, medium-term debt dynamics are sensitive to macro-financial shocks and the materialization of contingent liabilities, including from the banking sector and state-owned companies (Appendix III). Given low fiscal multipliers and substantial scope for efficiency gains, particularly in While final data is not yet available, the accrual-base deficit is estimated by the government to be significantly lower based on timing issues related mainly to EU funds and tax-related flows. As a result, the deficit is estimated by the government to be within Maastricht limits. The 2014 first fiscal notification will be published from Eurostat in late April. The 2015 Convergence Program is expected to be published by end-April, 2015. See Muir and Weber (2013).

This year’s 3 percent deficit target is achievable. However, with downside risks related to deflation and ambitious wage and health spending targets, expenditure restraint will again be critical. In the event these risks ma terialize, the authorities should seek savings in current spending—given scop for efficiency gains—and prioritize high-quality investment projects. Moreover, any revenue over-performance should be saved. Medium-term fiscal path. Targeting a structural balance by 2019—through an average adjustment of 0.75 percent of GDP per year— wo ld allow the government to improve debt dynamics and build up a liquidity buffer in good times, creating space to cope with contingent risks and allowing automatic stabilizers to work fully in the event of a modest negative shock. Concrete plans are needed to address medium-term fiscal risks. The aging population and continued emigration will create significant long-term public spending challenges. Measures to improve the composition and quality of expenditure and reduce contingent risks associated with state-owned enterprises, particularly related to transport and energy, will also be needed. Improving the design and sustainability of the pension system. Ensuring public pension sustainability, including through parametric reforms, remains critical, with concerns exacerbated by reversal and delays of earlier reforms. This will require a hard look at key features of the system—from retirement age to contributions and indexation formula to the operation of special and disability regimes. Last-minute provisions in the 2015 budget, allowing optional transfer from the second mandatory private pillar to the public system, represent a fundamental change in the design of Bulgaria’s three-pillar pension system. Implementing regulations, including unorthodox provisions for an open-ended option to shift between public and private systems over time, are expected to be proposed shortly. In this context, sufficient time should be provided for thorough impact analysis and stakeholder consultations on specific recommendations to mitigate potential risks to both the public and private systems. These include the change in the benefit formula from CPI indexation to the “golden Swiss rule” and the freezing of the retirement ages, which took place in 2014. Final recommendations of a working group comprised of relevant ministries, NSSI, parliamentarians, and social partners are currently under discussion, with a view to draft a new law in time for implementation in January 2016. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Baseline (FRA to stay constant at the 2015 level) Faster adjustment 1/ 2013 Article IV Bulgaria:EvolutionofGeneralGovernment Debt without Drawdown of FRA after 2015 Sources: BNB; MoF; and IMF staff calculations.1/ Assuming an annualdeficit reduction by 0.75% of GDP for 2016-19 to reach a balanced budget by 2019, and a balanced budget continues in 2020. Page 16 Enhancing health system efficiency. With the recent elimination of the National Health Insurance Fund’s arrears, follow-through on plans to improve its financial strength and the efficiency of the broader health system will be critical. Measures are needed to strengthen cost control mechanisms, increase incentives for proper use of outpatient versus inpatient services, and upgrade IT systems to improve risk management capacity. Strengthening fiscal risk management. To further reinforce public information regarding fiscal policy, disclosure regarding budgetary risks should be enhanced. In addition, risk analysis of contingent liabilities—both explicit and implicit—as well as sustainability analysis of pension and health systems, could be expanded. The authorities are encouraged to consider a Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (Appendix V). Redressing delays in the establishment of a fiscal council with operational independence would also support policy credibility. The authorities intend to pursue continued fiscal consolidation in the coming years. For 2015, the authorities agreed that the 3 percent deficit target was achievable, given the measures taken on containing wage and health spending. They were also encouraged by strong revenue performance during the first two months of the year, which they emphasized was supported by enhanced revenue administration efforts. They were, however, cautious about a faster pace of consolidation given what they see as still fragile growth dynamics. On pension reforms, they indicated that the reforms would increase flexibility for individuals to select the system best suited to their needs and risk appetites, and that they were alert to the importance of careful assessment of design features before their adoption. The authorities broadly agreed on staff’s recommendations to further enhance the transparency of fiscal indicators and the importance of strengthening the assessment of fiscal risks related to contingent liabilities as well as pension and health systems.
