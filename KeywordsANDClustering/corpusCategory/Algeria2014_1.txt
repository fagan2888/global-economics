Economic activity is expected to pick up in 2014. The hydrocarbon sector, which has been contracting in recent years, is expected to expand modestly, while nonhydrocarbon growth remains relatively robust. Inflation has fallen below the central bankâ€™s target, thanks in part to tighter monetary policy, but new pressures could emerge. External and fiscal buffers remain large, and the financial sector is generally healthy but underdeveloped. Long-standing vulnerabilities are coming into light. For the first time in nearly 15 years, the current account will record a deficit, as strong domestic hydrocarbon consumption and lower oil prices weigh on exports while (largely investment-related) imports continue to grow. After some consolidation in 2013, the fiscal deficit is projected to widen once again, further jeopardizing long- term sustainability. The economy remains overly dependent on the hydrocarbon sector and public spending, and is therefore vulnerable to a protracted decline in oil prices. Unemployment has stabilized at high levels, especially among youth and women.
