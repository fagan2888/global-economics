Implementation of staff’s recommended policies could reduce Ethiopia's external vulnerabilities and ease financing constraints, while at the same time support achievement of sustainable long-term growth (Table 7). The implications of these policies would be: (i) a lower current account deficit and a stronger exports performance, owing to timely implemented structural reforms and measures aimed at fostering external competitiveness, including exchange rate flexibility; (ii) a more sustainable debt trajectory, as a result of spreading out low-return large-scale investments over time and reducing State Owned Enterprises’ (SOEs) borrowing requirements; (iii) higher foreign exchange reserves, thus reducing volatility in foreign exchange availability; (iv) higher tax revenue, with a view to closing the fiscal gap in the medium term; and (v) stronger domestic savings with a view to narrowing the savings-investment gap, and larger accumulation of financing for investment in the long term—facilitated by higher real interest rates. The growth trajectory will be lower initially (reflecting slower imports of capital goods), but higher in the medium run, as macroeconomic stability will be enhanced, and mobilization of domestic resources improved. It would also minimize the risk of externally-induced economic stress episodes. This is consistent with staff research (Box 1) indicating the need to elicit private investment and the positive role that a moderation in the pace of public investment could play in this regard. The authorities envisage a substantially faster export and output expansion. Correspondingly, their assessment of future imbalances and associated risks to the baseline is more subdued that staff’s. They agreed on the need to reduce the current account deficit in the short term—mainly through the expected export expansion—as well as on policies to mobilize domestic resources and foster competitiveness and private investment. They also concurred, however, that in a hypothetical scenario of protracted progress in export gains, policies to re-profile import demand would be considered.
