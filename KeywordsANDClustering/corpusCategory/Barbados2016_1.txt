The economy appears to have turned the corner with activity picking up. Real GDP grew by 0.8 percent in 2015—underpinned by an increase in private investment and a surge in tourism arrivals—relative to 0.2 percent in 2014. Tourism arrivals increased by 13.9 percent, the highest in the Caribbean following Cuba and Aruba. Employment rose by 2 percent and the unemployment rate fell to 11.3 percent. Lower import prices pushed consumer prices down, with end-period inflation of -2.5 percent, compared to 2.3 percent in 2014. The external current account position has improved significantly, partly reflecting improved terms of trade. The current account deficit narrowed from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 6.7 percent in 2015, reflecting a sharp decline in import values due to lower oil and other prices, notwithstanding increased volumes of oil and intermediate goods imports. Exports of goods and services rose by 1.7 percent of GDP in 2015, mainly due to a tourism receipt increase of 3.6 percent. Net financial flows halved from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 4.0 percent in 2015, driven by large amortization payments and lower FDI. Net international reserves fell to US$469 million at end-April 2016 (2.8 months of imports), down by US$57 million from end-2014. Fiscal performance in FY2015/16 was disappointing. In late 2013, following several years of large fiscal deficits, the government renewed reform efforts including a substantial reduction in public sector employment. After significant consolidation in FY2014/15, the government undertook further adjustment measures, broadly in line with the staff’s recommendation in the 2015 Article IV (Box 1). The increase in Aruba is related to visitors from Venezuela. 2014/152015/16 (AIV)2015/16 (Est.)Total revenue28.829.329.7 Tax26.727.728.2Non-tax2.11.61.5 Total Expenditure-35.6-35.0-36.7 Current Exp (w/o Interest)-25.8-24.8-26.6Interest-7.6-7.6-7.7CapEx-2.2-2.6-2.4 Deficit-6.9-5.7-7.0 Sources: Barbados authorities and Fund staff calculations. Revenues and Expenditures: FY 2014/15 - FY 2015/16 (in percent of GDP) Page 10 Notwithstanding, the budget deficit in FY2015/16 remained broadly unchanged at about 7 percent of GDP, well short of the authorities’ objective. FY2015/16 budget measures increased revenue by approximately 1 percent of GDP, short of the government’s target, due to implementation delays. On the expenditure side, progress toward reducing transfers to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was slow, partially attributable to the unbudgeted debt service of one enterprise and transfers to support infrastructure investment financed by external sources, to address severe issues with the water mains. Given the high debt, financing the deficit is challenging. At end-FY2015/16, central government debt excluding (including) securities held by the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) was 105.5 (141.6) percent of GDP. Rollover requirements are about 45 percent of GDP and new financing is largely being met by the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), the NIS (through issuance of debentures in lieu of cash contributions for wages and salaries), and arrears. On April 1, 2016, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") downgraded Barbados' government bond rating to Caa1 and changed the outlook to stable, largely on account of the high fiscal deficit and growing debt levels. Arrears are large and growing. Staff estimates that central government arrears rose from 4.3 percent of GDP at end-FY2014/15 to 5.9 percent at end-FY2015/16, including arrears to the NIS. SOE arrears are estimated to have risen to 5.5 percent of GDP, of which the largest share is to the Barbados Revenue Authority (BRA) and NIS. Arrears are impeding private sector transactions, inhibiting investment, and may be contributing to erosion of tax compliance. The financial sector remains stable while commercial bank liquidity continues to rise. Financial sector indicators show that the banks are well capitalized and very liquid, and hence, have strong protection against macro-financial risks (text table and Annex IV). Private sector credit growth turned modestly positive in 2015, following two years of decline. Other financial indicators remain strong, although profitability remains low with a 0.9 percent return on assets. Bank non-performing loans (NPLs) declined to 10.6 percent of total loans, a trend that the CBB expects will continue over the near-term. The most recent stress tests published by the CBB show bank capital-asset ratios to be robust to a significant increase in NPLs. Given modest private sector credit demand, bank liquidity continues to increase and commercial bank excess reserves in local currency rose by B$353 million in Cash deficit is higher, as the government reports revenues on an accrual basis. 201320142015Commercial Banks Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)19.720.518.9Liquid assets, in percent of total assets18.020.325.3Non-performing loans ratio 11.711.510.6Return on Assets (ROA)0.80.70.9 Credit Unions Loan to deposit ratio 90.592.790.8Non-performing loans ratio 8.79.49.1Return on Assets (ROA)0.90.60.6 Sources: CBB and Fund staff calculations.

Implementation of 2015 Article IV Recommendations Areas where there was progress in the following 2015 Article IV recommendations Contain current spending through further reductions in the wage bill and transfers. While the wages and salaries bill (in percent of GDP) fell marginally in 2015/16, transfers increased by an estimated 0.7 percent of GDP, partially due to an unbudgeted debt amortization of one entity. Accelerate restructuring of public enterprises, including amalgamation or divestment. The authorities have set up a Monitoring Unit, and are reviewing the business plans of 15 large state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, progress in rationalizing and reining in spending has been slow. Continued to make progress in implementing several of the 2014 FSAP Update recommendations: Legislative amendments to the CBB, FSC and Financial Institutions Act are being drafted or are before Parliament; the strategic plan for Barbados Deposit Insurance Corporation (BDIC), and discussions on a deposit insurance system for credit unions are continuing. Areas where there was limited or no progress Establish a medium-term fiscal consolidation framework—with a debt anchor. The government missed its 2015/2016 deficit target by a significant margin, and the central government debt-to-GDP ratio continued to rise by an estimated 7.5 percentage points. Review social spending to better target social programs. No discernible progress. Improve the quality of public services by reducing delays and inefficiency, and reviewing the impact of labor market regulations on employment growth. No progress. Cease central bank financing of the government and, if financing sources are not sufficient, allow interest rates to rise to support the exchange rate peg. The CBB continues to be a major purchaser of government debt although it has allowed interest rates to rise somewhat. Shortcomings related to production and dissemination of data should be addressed before the next Article IV consultation. Despite ongoing TA, progress in improving data and resolving inconsistencies between real and nominal GDP and the deflator has been slow. Monetary policy is driven by fiscal considerations. The CBB has continued to fund the government through money creation as well as using commercial banks’ excess reserves. Direct intervention by the CBB in the Treasury Bill (TB) auction in the 2015 pushed down interest rates, although in the more recent auctions, the short-term rate rose to an average of about 3.4 percent, from 2.8 percent in 2015. CBB purchases of TBs and debentures accounted for approximately two- thirds of the increase in financing of the government in 2015. Page 12 While the political situation remains stable, public frustration with weak growth and fiscal adjustment is mounting. The Democratic Labour Party has been in power since 2008, narrowly winning reelection in February 2013. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2018. There are growing signs of frustration following multiple tax increases, a 10 percent government work force reduction, and a wage freeze since 2009. Real wages are 11½ percent lower than in 2008. Labor action is increasing, including a temporary closure of the port and airport in March 2016, and demands for wage increases are becoming more pressing. Wage pressures are exacerbated by the recent unwinding of a late 2013 10 percent voluntary wage cut for ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.
