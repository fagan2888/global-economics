Discussions focused on policies to further advance income convergence with Western Europe: the planned euro adoption would spur economic integration and entail a strengthening of policy frameworks; fiscal policy could pay dividends from raising the quality of public spending and continuing with its disciplined approach; with financial stability in place, the focus is shifting to ensuring sufficient credit to fund productive investment; and structural reforms would help raise economic efficiency. The authorities are open to the Fund’s policy advice and have implemented many past recommendations (Box 3). Box 3. Implementation of Past Fund Advice Fiscal Policy. The authorities have been pushing ahead with the recommended fiscal consolidation and appear to have met the euro entry criterion on the fiscal deficit with a good safety margin. However, consolidation remains biased to the expenditure side. Suggestions to consider higher recurrent taxation of wealth and property remain under discussion. Financial Sector Policy. The Fund’s past advice has focused on addressing weaknesses in the domestic banking system. The authorities have meanwhile intervened and closed the two largest domestic banks, thereby removing risks to financial stability. Attention has now turned to issues in the small credit union sector. MCM has provided technical assistance for reform. Structural Policy. The authorities share the Fund’s view that price competitiveness gains from post-crisis adjustment need to be preserved. They have taken steps to further improve the business climate, including through simplification of territorial planning rules. Migration policies to help address challenges from demographic aging are under consideration. There has also been some progress with improving frameworks to work out debt.
