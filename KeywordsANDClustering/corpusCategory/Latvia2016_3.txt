While Latvia continues to make steady economic progress, a key challenge will be to generate the growth necessary to sustain the pace of income convergence with Western Europe. This will require a broad two- pronged strategy based on macro- structural reforms to enhance productivity, maintain competitiveness, and improve equity in the medium-to long-run; and macro-financial policies to resuscitate credit to support investment and growth, especially in the short-run. Actions to address the gray—informal—economy will also be crucial . The pervasive gray economy, which by some estimates may amount to 20-25 percent of GDP, is preventing Latvia from fulfilling its potential. In particular, it is hindering the efficient allocation of resources, including access to capital, creating an unfair playing field, and limiting revenues that are necessary to develop the country to everyone’s benefit.
