Macroeconomic outcomes have weakened in the face of the persistent oil price shock and regional security problems. Acute liquidity problems in the first half of 2016 have forced the government to severely limit spending and to continue to accrue domestic arrears with adverse impacts on private sector activity and the banking system. Economic activity has slowed sharply . GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated significantly to 1.8 percent in 2015 from 6.9 percent in 2014 (Text Figure 2b). This sharp slowdown was largely due to a 2.9 percent contraction in the non–oil sector (compared to a 7.1 percent expansion in 2014). Erratic rainfall hit food crops, while livestock and fishing activities were affected by the weakened security situation and a difficult economic situation in Nigeria. Both the secondary and tertiary sectors contracted significantly due to the sharp adjustment to fiscal spending and to disruptions caused by the deterioration of security conditions. Disruptions to cross–border trade flows with Cameroon and Nigeria have led to increased volatility of domestic prices . Due in particular to food items (46 percent of the consumer price index), inflation reached 7.6 percent year-on-year in August 2015, then turned negative at end-2015 (-0.3 percent year-on-year), and going further negative in 2016, Page 11 reaching -3.4 percent in March. The annual average for 2015 was 3.7 percent, slightly above the CEMAC target of 3 percent. Despite a large fiscal adjustment, the overall fiscal deficit remained high in 2015 and domestic arrears accrued . Total fiscal revenue fell 40 percent short of the 2015 revised budget target. In particular, customs revenue disappointed: it fell by 16 percent relative to 2014 on account of security disruptions to cross- border trade and a slowdown in demand from Nigeria (Text Figure 2a). Oil revenues were only one third of the amount originally projected. Even though expenditure commitments were held 1.6 percent of non-oil GDP below the revised budget, the overall fiscal deficit on a commitment basis still amounted to 6.6 percent of non-oil GDP.

A successful expansion in the placement of Treasury bills and bonds in the regional market (a net issuance of CFAF 188 billion) was mostly used to swap non-tradable public debt and pay some claims that were under litigation. External budget support amounted to CFAF 90 billion. After a temporary increase in September on account of the statutory and exceptional advances, government deposits at the BEAC declined to CFAF 93.4 billion at the end of 2015, against CFAF 119.3 billion one year before. The sharp decline in oil revenue in early 2016 has seriously complicated fiscal management . Oil revenues (net of oil sales advances’ repayments and cash calls contributions) were only 0.4 percent of non-oil GDP in the first quarter, while non-oil revenue also lagged due to an apparent deceleration of economic activity. The government paid salaries and debt service with difficulty (even accruing some small external arrears with multilateral creditors for a few days) and appeared to be forced to drastically restrict spending on goods and services, transfers, and investment even in the run-up to the presidential elections. Apart from an increase in the stock of arrears to CFAF 280 billion at end-March, available data do not allow to ascertain the success of those restrictions in containing spending commitments. Money supply contracted and credit to the private sector slowed significantly in 2015 Broad money fell by 4.7 percent while credit to the private sector (equivalent to 10.5 percent of non- See Selected Issues Paper (SIP) on Chad’s first steps in the regional public securities market.

The health of the banking system has been impacted by the difficult economic situation and the accumulation of arrears by the government. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose from 11.7 to 16.5 percent of total loans over the twelve months up to December 2015 and their provisioning was limited to 56.1 percent against 68.3 percent one year before. This could negatively affect banks’ capacity and willingness to lend. The external accounts weakened in 2015. The external current account deficit widened from 9 percent of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 12.4 percent of GDP in 2015 on account of the further decline in oil prices and a corresponding fall in exports. The current account deficit was partially financed by foreign direct investment, concentrated in the oil sector. The remainder was financed with a rundown in the level of pooled international reserves imputed to Chad from US$1.19 billion at end-2014 to US$390 million at end- 2015 (approximately 1 month of imports).
