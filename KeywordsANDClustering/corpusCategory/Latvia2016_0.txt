Latvia continues to make steady economic progress in terms of stability and growth, but per capita GDP remains well below the Western European average. Macroeconomic conditions are generally favorable. The output gap is almost closed, the current account is broadly in line with fundamentals, and unemployment continues to decline. The fiscal deficit has been reduced to a sustainable level, and public debt is among the lowest in Europe. Nevertheless, GDP growth has slowed significantly over the last three years amid weak external conditions and diminishing productivity gains, credit growth remains elusive, and wage pressures have surfaced with tightening labor market conditions. And while income per capita continues to rise, it remains around 40 percent below the EU-15 average. A number of the 2015 Article IV policy recommendations have been broadly implemented . Notably, measures have been adopted to increase the revenue envelope and make the tax system more progressive. The development of credit bureaus and reforms to insolvency procedures and the court system are ongoing. Close supervision of non-resident deposit (NRD) specialized banks continues and anti-money laundering (AML) supervision has been stepped up. The minimum wage in 2016 was raised in line with productivity growth, and reforms in education to reduce skills mismatches are progressing. Nonetheless, shifting the tax burden towards property taxation, improving SOE governance, and strengthening infrastructure are still to be addressed. A new government was appointed on February 11, 2016 and OECD accession is scheduled. The new Prime Minister, Māris Kučinskis, who is from the same center-right coalition, but a different party, has indicated that there will be policy continuity. On May 11, the OECD invited Latvia to join the organization following 3 years of accession discussions.
