Switzerland has once again had to contend with capital flow volatility. Following the exit from the exchange rate floor and the subsequent appreciation of the franc, the Swiss economy faces exchange rate overvaluation, slower near-term growth, and deflation. Both growth and inflation are expected to recover gradually over the medium term, to around 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively. However, this relatively benign scenario is subject to important risks, most notably that operating in a low inflation environment may prove more difficult than assumed in the central scenario.
