Boosting growth and job creation, thus reducing extremely high unemployment and inequality, and promoting social transformation remain South Africaâ€™s key challenges. In addition, the shocks that hit the economy in 2015 require immediate attention to maintain hard-won macroeconomic stability and restore confidence. Progress in the structural area is urgent given that global growth and commodity prices are expected to remain low for long, many of the problems are structural, and macroeconomic policies have to address vulnerabilities. Macroeconomic policies have to be designed and calibrated carefully: too little tightening and confidence could wane and debt could continue rising, but too much tightening could further weaken growth and become self-defeating. Recent country experience suggests that EMs that took more consistent and decisive action and complemented macroeconomic adjustment with structural reforms achieved the largest improvement in fundamentals and were more resilient to subsequent shocks.
