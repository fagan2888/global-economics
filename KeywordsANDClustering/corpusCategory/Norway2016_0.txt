Growth has continued to slow in the mainland economy. At the start of this year, oil prices had dropped by roughly 60 percent from their peak in June 2014 to less than US$40 per barrel. The adverse terms of trade movement has taken a toll on output in the mainland economy. Mainland GDP growth fell to 1 percent last year— the lowest rate since the 2008–09 crisis. The mainland economy expanded by 0.3 percent (q/q) in the first quarter of this year, supported mainly by unusually high electricity production but also public and household consumption, while investment continued its declining trend. Within the mainland economy, there is growing divergence in performance between the more oil- dependent sectors (e.g., oil services) and the rest of the economy, with the former largely driving the slowdown in economic activity (Figure 1). The labor market is feeling the sting of the oil price crash. The seasonally-adjusted Labor Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate reached 4.7 percent in March—the highest level in ten years. Rising unemployment is mainly driven by strong labor force growth, but employment started to falter in the fourth quarter (Figure 2). Unemployment is increasingly concentrated in oil- dependent parts of the country (e.g., Rogaland), while remaining stable or even falling in other parts. Headline and core inflation have recently risen above the 2.5 percent target. Core inflation was 2.7 percent on average last year but it reached 3.3 percent in April after peaking at 3.4 percent in February, largely due to the effect of exchange rate depreciation on imported goods prices. Meanwhile, wage growth—2.8 percent last year—has been subdued and inflation expectations are stable (Figure 3). For previous analyses of the impact of oil sector developments on the Norwegian mainland economy, see e.g. 2013 and 2015 Selected Issues Papers (Chapter 3 of IMF Country Report No. 13/273 and Chapter 1 of IMF Country Report 15/250, respectively), and Technical Note on Bank Stress Testing for the 2015 FSAP Update (IMF Country Report No. 15/258). Core inflation in Norway is measured by change in CPI-ATE, i.e. adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products.

LFS Unemployment Rising Fast in Oil Region (Percent, 4-quarter moving average) Page 12 The krone has weakened substantially in parallel with the decline in oil prices. import-weighted nominal exchange rate has depreciated by about 25 percent since early 2013, and the krone is assessed to be moderately undervalued relative to economic fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex I). The competitive exchange rate has helped reverse some of the long- term deterioration in Norway’s unit labor cost (ULC) measured in common currency, boosting exports of traditional goods. Yet, the current account surplus narrowed in 2015, almost entirely due to the fall in the value of oil and gas exports (Figure 4). House price inflation accelerated recently after the slowdown throughout 2015, but with significant regional variation . House prices increased by 6.1 percent last year, but the pace tapered throughout the year in line with slowing income growth. The national figure masks wide regional variation, with prices rising robustly in the Oslo area while declining in areas most affected by falling oil prices (e.g., Stavanger). Household debt as a share of disposable income is largely unchanged at about 220 percent in mid- 2015 (Figure 5). There was a surge in asylum seekers late last year (Annex III). Norway received over 27,000 first-time asylum applicants between June and December last year—almost four times as many for the same period in 2014. This brought the total number of applicants for the entire year to over 31,000 (0.6 percent of the population), a third of whom came from Syria. The government expects a slightly lower inflow in 2016 of about 25,000, although with a very large degree of uncertainty, and proposed a broadly budget-neutral increase in spending of about 0.4 percent of mainland GDP to handle the extra inflows of asylum seekers.
