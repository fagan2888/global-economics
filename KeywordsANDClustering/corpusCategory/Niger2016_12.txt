Niger’s business environment remains difficult despite recent improvements . The World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Index ranked Niger 150 th out of 190 countries, up from 176 th out of 189 countries in 2014, but still below other WAEMU members and SSA averages for some indicators (Figure 1). While the business environment in most WAEMU countries is weak in many aspects, dealing with construction regulations, and paying taxes were identified as particularly problematic in Niger. Other specific concerns identified by the local business community include: declining activity in the telecommunications sector following the introduction of a tax on incoming calls in 2014 and delays in processing reimbursements of VAT credits and of tax exemptions refunds. Staff commended the authorities for shortening the time and procedures required to start a business, improving access to credit information by establishing a credit bureau, and making contracts enforcement easier by creating a specialized commercial court. However, staff urged an acceleration of efforts, in particular improvements in tax administration. To sustain the improvement of competitiveness, the authorities will speed up measures aimed at overcoming barriers identified in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes.
