AND RISKS Delayed approval of the 2015 budget hindered performance of key macroeconomic indicators. Economic activity slowed as public investment projects were kept on hold due to the late approval of the 2015 budget. In addition, poor rains affected crop yields, particularly, cocoa production. As a result, GDP growth in 2015 is estimated to have fallen below the projected 5 percent by almost 1 percentage point. The end-December 2015 inflation fell below the projected 5 percent, aided by weakened demand and falling international prices of oil and other commodities. Fiscal consolidation efforts have been hampered by tax revenue underperformance and a mismatch between the timing of donor budget support grants and corresponding expenditure. Tax revenue is estimated to have fallen short of the end of year target by about 0.7 percent of GDP, in part due to a lower collection effort of tax arrears and delayed inclusion of the 15,000 new taxpayers registered during the operation tax inclusion project. In addition, ENCO (the oil importing company) continues to accumulate new tax arrears (estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP) in 2015. There was also about 2.2 percent of GDP shortfall in donor budget support grants. While the authorities made modest offsetting cuts in expenditure to accommodate domestic revenue underperformance, these were insufficient, resulting in a domestic primary deficit of about 3.0 percent of GDP, higher than the program target of 2.7 percent of GDP. The authorities have begun implementing the domestic arrears clearance plan agreed under the ECF-supported program. The arrears clearance plan proposes clearing government’s outstanding arrears to the utility company (EMAE), general suppliers and to ENCO while also preventing the accumulation of new arrears. In particular, the plan outlines that the government would amortize all arrears to: (i) EMAE in 2015; (ii) general suppliers in five years starting from 2015; and (iii) ENCO over 40 years with no interest charges starting from 2016. These amortizations which add to about 1 percent of GDP on average annually through 2020 and 0.2 percent of GDP thereafter have been incorporated into the program. An automatic fuel price adjusted mechanism is to be introduced by end-June 2016 to prevent the accumulation of new arrears. The plan also proposes clearing EMAE’s arrears to ENCO over 10 years, starting in 2015. The government has already cleared all arrears to EMAE in 2015, 1.2 percent of GDP (0.5 percent of GDP higher than budgeted). EMAE in turn paid the equivalent of 2.6 percent of GDP of its arrears to ENCO. Despite this payment, The change in government and late assumption of office by the new government delayed the approval of the 2015 budget. The 2016 budget was however approved on time. World Bank budget support grant for 2015 did not materialize due to delays by the authorities to provide documentation on MOUs signed with China Harbor Engineering on the deepwater port project to assess whether the terms in the MOU are consistent with the ECF-supported program. Page 15 EMAE’s arrears to ENCO in 2015 increased on net basis by 2.2 percent of GDP, albeit, by less than initially projected under the plan. Going forward, EMAE may face difficulties in making full payments to ENCO, in line with the plan, due to delays in reaching agreement with investors on alternative energy sources over the purchase price of energy. Clearance of government arrears to ENCO will start this year, and are included in the 2016 budget. The external current account deficit fell to 17 percent of GDP, reflecting weak economic activity and contraction in oil imports that more than offset the decline in cocoa exports. Gross international reserves, estimated at US$61 million (4.4 months of import cover) at the end of 2015, remain at comfortable levels. There are signs that the stress in the financial system has intensified. The capital adequacy ratio for the entire banking system fell from 20.3 percent in December 2014 to 15.5 percent at the end of 2015, while capital to risk-weighted assets ratio increased to 24.1 percent from 22.6 percent, following recent capital injections by several banks. Moreover, non-performing loans have increased to a historic high of about 30 percent following the reclassification of overdue overdrafts in Banco Equador’s books as bad loans and a downgrade in a sizeable share of the largest bank’s loan classification to loss. The macroeconomic outlook is favorable in the near term but challenges remain. GDP is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2016 aided by higher and a more timely execution of public investments, recovery in cocoa production and increased foreign direct investment (FDI) in the tourism sector. However, the current slowdown in credit expansion as a result of large and rising NPLs, in particular to small enterprises, is negatively affecting economic activities and the economic growth acceleration prospects. Inflation is expected to remain around 4 percent on the back of falling international prices of food and petroleum products, but still higher than the euro area inflation. Staff’s medium-term projection shows real GDP growth falling short of the authorities’ target of 6 percent; inflation stabilizing at 3 percent; and the current account deficit contracting further. Risks are tilted to the downside (see Box 2). The forthcoming presidential election slated for July 2016, with the risk of extra budgetary spending , and continued weakness in the banking sector and potential contingent claims on the budget, are the main sources of short-term risks to the outlook. Authorities have however, expressed firm commitment to avoid electoral spending beyond what is budgeted and are working swiftly to address weaknesses in the banking sector including a comprehensive asset quality review and a strategy to address the high and rising NPLs (to be implemented in June 2016). Additional downside risks could arise from weak demand in key advanced and emerging economies, which could dampen FDI and tourism inflows and reduce exports to those economies. Adoption of policies that increase fiscal space would serve as a buffer. In the past, fiscal consolidation efforts have been undermined during elections. Page 16 Figure 2.

São Tomé and Príncipe: Risk Assessment Matrix 2016 Source of Risks Domestic risks Early start to the political cycle for the 2016 Presidential election could result in extra budgetary spending. Relative Likelihood Potential Impact Policy Response Medium High . Significant election related spending would lead to additional borrowing needs and derail gains in fiscal rectitude. Maintain fiscal prudence by ensuring that spending plans for 2016 proceed as budgeted. Continued weakness in banking intermediation. High External risks A surge in global financial volatility and decompression of credit spreads following slow growth as well as protracted policy uncertainty in the euro area. Weak demand in key advanced and emerging economies. High High High . Continued high levels of nonperforming loans and low profitability of banks would prevent a bottoming out of the credit cycle and adversely affect economic growth. In the worst case scenario, there is a potential for a significant cost from bank restructuring. Require a comprehensive strategy, including a detailed asset quality review, to address the high stock of nonperforming loans. In addition, there is the need for increased enforcement of prudential requirements including increased provisioning and recapitalization of affected banks. Low . Increased financial volatility could cause foreign investors to become more risk averse and reduce financial flows, elevate inflationary pressures and undermine growth prospects. Keep fiscal discipline and step up liquidity management to back the growth and inflation objectives; maintain adequate foreign reserves. Medium . Weakness in external demand could dampen São Tomé and Príncipe’s exports and contribute to lower real GDP growth. Increased volatility of energy prices due to uncertainty about the oil supply shock. Medium Medium . The associated price fluctuations could add to existing macroeconomic uncertainties. Source: IMF staff estimates.
