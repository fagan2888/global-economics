All quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2014, continuous quantitative program targets, and structural benchmarks were met, albeit that the Banking Services Bill was tabled, it required subsequent and still ongoing fine-tuning in collaboration with Fund staff. The March indicative target for tax collection was, however, missed (Text Table 1). Several new and revised structural benchmarks are proposed as well as modified quantitative PCs for June to December 2014 and new ones for March 2015 (Tables 8 and 9). Revisions to the existing performance criteria on the cumulative changes in net international reserves and net domestic assets are proposed, to reflect the direct impact of Fund budget support (see below) on the monetary targets. On the structural side, new benchmarks are proposed to: 4th Review PCAdjusted PCsEnd-Mar.PC Status End-Mar.End-Mar. 2014End-Mar.ActualDifference2014 Fiscal targets 1.

Jamaica: Program Monitoring—Quantitative Performance Criteria under EFF 1/ (In billions of Jamaican dollars) Page 21 Ensure adherence to the cumulative ceiling on the value of new PPPs (of 3 percent of GDP) consistent with the fiscal rule law (a continuous structural benchmark). Implement pilot projects for the new information systems at the customs and tax administration (by end-December 2014, and February 2015, respectively), and set targets for strengthening the Large Taxpayers Office (March 2015). Finalize an update of the e-Census database for all government employees (September 2014), and prepare an action plan for public sector transformation (September 2014). Table in parliament the revised legislation on public sector pensions (June 2015). The structural benchmark on putting in place the legal and regulatory framework for the securities dealers sector is proposed to be moved from end-June to end-December 2014, given that the complexity of the reform, which is designed with extensive technical assistance, demands further preparation. The program remains fully financed and staff’s assessment of Jamaica’s capacity to repay the Fund remains broadly unchanged from the last review (Table 10) . Jamaica’s capacity to repay the Fund will continue to depend on the timely and strong implementation of the ambitious program. External financing has remained broadly in line with earlier program assumptions, with IFI disbursements expected to be relatively backloaded in the current fiscal year. However, the shift in the outlook for cash flows will create a timing problem for the budget in the first half of the fiscal year (with cash flow deficits expected until October—including with a US$200 million Eurobond payment due in October—and cash surpluses expected thereafter). At the same time, the ability to smooth out the financing need is severely limited by the constraints on domestic borrowing imposed by illiquidity in the government bond market (alongside the inactive secondary market). To handle this temporary near-term cash-flow need, staff propose that the scheduled June and September 2014 purchases under the extended arrangement should now be provided in the form of direct budget support. Such budget support would help avoid or limit the need to borrow at expensive rates on international markets or defer budget spending, and help prevent the unwelcome precedent of the central bank offering direct credit to the government (the absence of which has been a critical feature in the BOJ’s operational independence). Debt service to the Fund and the purchase profile remain unchanged in the absence of significant revisions to the macroeconomic outlook.
