The economy stabilized in 2013 . Following a rapid increase in public spending in 2011â€“12 to meet pressing social demands and to weather the recent regional turmoil, inflation spiked in 2012. It was subsequently reined in through monetary policy tightening initiated in May 2012 and fiscal consolidation implemented in 2013. External and fiscal buffers are large, and the banking sector is sound. However, long-standing vulnerabilities remain and new uncertainties are emerging Following large surpluses for most of the past decade, the current account balance is expected to turn into a deficit in the medium term as fast-growing domestic consumption of hydrocarbons squeezes exports. Despite recent fiscal consolidation, the fiscal stance remains unsustainable. Economic growth continues to be overly dependent on public spending and vulnerable to a protracted decline in oil prices. Unemployment is still high, especially among youth and women.
