The deteriorated outlook and heightened global uncertainty call for a determined and sustained macroeconomic policy adjustment, while the need for economic diversification and inclusive growth calls for an ambitious structural reform agenda. The authorities’ steps in 2015 to boost non-mining revenues, achieve savings in spending, and foster exchange rate adjustment were in the right direction, and the monetary stance reduced liquidity in the banking system but remained broadly adequate. Projections for a sustained terms-of-trade shock will require the policy response to be strengthened to support macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Achieving this objective will require advancing on three pillars: policies to support external sustainability; policies to support debt sustainability; and renewed structural reforms to support private sector development and job creation (to be incorporated in the post-2015 development strategy). These would include greater exchange rate flexibility supported by FX market reforms, renewed fiscal consolidation efforts to place the public debt on a firm downward trend, and reforms to promote private sector development and improve competitiveness, trade, and access to credit and FX. Formulating and implementing such policy agenda will require close coordination to define the appropriate composition of the policy adjustment and to support policy consistency across the three pillars—including policies to enhance the resilience of the financial sector by monitoring and managing financial stability risks. Greater policy flexibility will also be required in light of a more Page 14 volatile global environment. Hence, strengthening policy formulation and transparency will further reduce uncertainty, anchor expectations and improve credibility of macro policies.
