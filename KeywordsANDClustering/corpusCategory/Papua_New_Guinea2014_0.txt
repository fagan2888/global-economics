Papua New Guineaâ€™s (PNG) economy has entered a transitional growth period, as new liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and exports commence. The successful completion of the LNG project, ahead of schedule in May 2014, has demonstrated a new level of capacity to undertake large-scale commercial development and has increased investor confidence in developing large projects in the future. However, spillovers from the LNG project to the rest of the economy are limited, with structural weaknesses also impeding higher, broad-based growth in the non-resource sector. Papua New Guinea faces high costs of doing business. At present, job-intensive small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) and agricultural activity are burdened by inadequate infrastructure, high energy costs, lack of skilled workers, limited access to credit, poor security, and regulatory weaknesses. Meanwhile, policy buffers to counter exogenous shocks have shrunk. The sharp fiscal expansions of the past three years have significantly reduced fiscal space, with large fiscal deficits and rising public debt. Inflation is moderate, but foreign reserves, while still adequate (at 4 months of prospective imports at end-September), have fallen substantially from their record levels, and excess demand in the foreign exchange (FX) market may have worsened following the introduction in early June 2014 of a trading band around the official exchange rate and the requirement for banks to use the band in their transactions with customers.
