With macroeconomic stability restored, Mauritania needs to focus its economic policies on increasing the economy’s resilience to external shocks and promoting inclusive growth . With the support of the ECF arrangement (2010–13), the authorities managed to restore macroeconomic stability with high economic growth, contained inflation, a more prudent fiscal stance, and improved policy space. Both fiscal and external buffers improved thanks to exceptional donor assistance, better tax collection, rising iron ore prices, and fishing proceeds. However, a 49 percent decline (year-on-year) in iron ore prices in 2014 again exposed Mauritania’s vulnerability to terms-of-trade shocks: receipts related to the extractive sector account for 75 percent of exports and 30 percent of fiscal revenues. The medium-term outlook hinges on the authorities’ capacity to consolidate macroeconomic stability by strengthening policy formulation and governance; strengthen the financial sector and promote financial inclusion; and undertake broad structural reforms to promote private sector development and economic diversification, to broaden and sustain growth and promote inclusion. After a double victory in parliamentary and presidential elections, Mauritania’s ruling party has the political space to undertake renewed economic reforms. The ruling party and its allies gained a majority in the Parliament, paving the way for legislative economic reforms. President Abdel Aziz intends to strengthen national unity, the judiciary system, and governance, while reducing social inequality and poverty through better redistribution.
