The economy is expected to emerge from recession in late 2016 as the one-off impact of the initial measures to remove macroeconomic distortions begins to fade . Staff is now forecasting growth of -1¾ percent for 2016 as a whole rising to 2¾ percent in 2017, one of the largest growth turnaround in the October 2016 World Economic Outlook . A modest headwind from the planned reduction of the fiscal deficit should be offset by a pickup in private consumption, an improving external environment, and a rebound of private investment. Over the medium term, growth is expected to average around 3 percent as reforms are put in place to strengthen the business environment, encourage investment, lower inflation, and restore order to fiscal finances. However, data challenges and the uncertain process of Argentina’s transition away from its previously unsustainable path create significant uncertainty in the outlook. Banks’ gross FX position is also low as it represents around 17.6 percent of assets and 17.7 percent of liabilities (data as of July 2016). Much of the FX assets are very liquid (deposits at the BCRA and cash), with 29.3 percent corresponding to FX loans. But banks can only grant FX loans to those who actually have FX income (mainly exporters) which significantly reduces risks from a depreciation of the peso. pp pp ee K Corporate Debt (Percent of GDP) 1/ Avg.

Page 20 Inflation will continue to decline at a slow pace due to a relatively high degree of inertia in the determination of wages and prices Inflation has decelerated sharply since its peak in April, as the pass-through from the exchange rate depreciation and the effects of the tariff adjustment have dissipated. In August and September 2016, official headline inflation was affected by the reversal of the increase in natural gas tariffs, which subtracted about 0.7 percentage points to the index values in both months. Core inflation continued to decline and reached 1½ percent (m/m) in September, consistent with about 20 percent annual rate. However, collective wage bargaining is still likely to inject a backward-looking element into the determination of nominal wages, and this nominal inertia is expected to slow the pace at which inflation falls (Box 3). Headline inflation is forecast to fall to 20 percent by end-2017— assuming nominal wage increases can be held to around 25 percent and energy subsidies are scaled back in line with the budget assumptions—and to single digits by 2021. A faster pace of disinflation appears unadvisable given the significant impact on growth that would accompany such a path for inflation. The primary federal deficit is expected to fall to 4½ percent of GDP in 2017, a close to neutral fiscal stance in cyclically adjusted terms Based on the authorities’ budget plans, in 2017 spending on pensions and public works is expected to be more than offset by a 1 percent of GDP reduction in transfers to the private sector (half of which reflects lower energy subsidies) and a ½ percent of GDP cut in discretionary transfers to provinces. At 4½ percent of GDP, staff’s forecast of the federal primary deficit is modestly higher than the deficit in the proposed 2017 Budget (4.2 percent of GDP) due to differences in macroeconomic projections. After 2017, the primary federal deficit is expected to improve by around ¾ percent of GDP per year, a result of an elimination of energy subsidies by 2019 and lower spending on goods and services and other current spending. Gross debt of the federal government is projected to fall slowly (from 52 percent in 2015 to 48 percent of GDP by 2021), reflecting the lower deficit and the projected real appreciation of the peso. Despite this adjustment, the gross fiscal financing needs in 2017 are around 11 percent of GDP, which are expected to be met through an increase in external debt, central bank financing of Page 21 Box 3. Inflation, Expectations, and Wages Some stylized facts Nominal wages grew at a much faster pace than inflation after the 2001 crisis, allowing real wages to return to pre-crisis levels by 2005. Since then, real wages have been relatively sticky despite recessions in 2009 and 2012. Persistently high inflation and inflation expectations have added to nominal inertia with a wage setting system that is characterized by extensive sectoral wage bargaining and a de-facto high level of wage indexation, despite the lack of formal backward indexation. An inflation model Estimating a small macroeconomic model for Argentina reveals a relatively high degree of persistence in nominal wage growth, inflation, and inflation expectations. Real wages appear to respond relatively weakly to changes in real activity: 𝑝̇ 𝑡 = 0.51𝑝̇ 𝑡 𝑒 + 0.47𝑤̇ 𝑡 − 0.37𝑟 𝑡 + 𝜖 𝑝̇,𝑡 𝑒 = 5.4 + 0.57𝑝̇ 𝑡−1 𝑝̇ 𝑡 𝑒 + 0.12𝑒̇ 𝑡 − 0.41𝑟 𝑡 + 𝜖 𝑝̇ 𝑒 ,𝑡 𝑤̇ 𝑡 = 0.96𝑤̇ 𝑡−1 + 0.13𝑔 𝑡 + 𝜖 𝑤̇ ,𝑡 where 𝑝̇ 𝑡 is inflation rate, 𝑝̇ 𝑡 𝑔 𝑡 GDP growth, 𝑒̇ 𝑡 the exchange rate appreciation, and ϵ are shocks. 𝑒 inflation expectations, 𝑤̇ 𝑡 nominal wage growth, 𝑟 𝑡 the real interest rate, Model performance and forecasts . The estimated model seems to fit relatively well Argentina’s inflation dynamics over the last decade. Simulating the model forward, shows inflation declining from 39 percent at end-2016 to 20 percent in 2017. This would be accompanied by a further 3¾ percent real appreciation of the peso and 2.7 percent growth in 2017. Using this same model, reducing inflation to 17 percent by end-2017 (the upper end of the central bank’s target band) would require a 400 basis point increase in the path of real interest rates during the course of this year and next, and would result in a one percentage point lower growth in real activity in 2017 relative to staff’s baseline. Page 22 1½ percent of GDP, and domestic debt issuance. Gross fiscal financing needs are expected to remain substantial over the medium term, averaging 8½ percent of GDP in 2018–19. The current account deficit is expected to rise steadily to 4¼ percent of GDP by 2021 . A steady appreciation in the real effective exchange rate, relatively flat terms of trade, and the swing to sustained growth are expected to add to the current account deficit. This is expected to be financed by higher public debt issuance, some repatriation of offshore funds in 2016–17 (to take advantage of the tax amnesty), and a rise of inward FDI. The central bank is expected to steadily accumulate international reserves from current low levels (to 100 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric by mid-2018). The reserve accumulation will be largely as a result of converting the proceeds of government external debt issuance into pesos, consistent with the authorities’ commitment to let the exchange rate float freely under the inflation targeting (IT) regime. The outlook is subject to a greater than usual degree of uncertainty but risks appear broadly balanced around the baseline . Argentina is in a process of significant transition to a more market-based economic framework and is simultaneously working to rebuild the statistical information about their economy. The lack of a reliable statistical time series for certain data and the unpredictable consequences of changes in relative prices, the removal of distortions, and a reopening of the economy to international capital flows all add to the uncertainty around future economic outcomes. Upside risks . Staff’s baseline scenario is subject to a number of upside risks (Risk Assessment Matrix Table): A faster rebound in private investment . Argentine companies have relatively low levels of leverage and have neglected investing in new capacity and technologies over the past several years (in large part due to the distortions and policy interventions that the economy faced). Indeed, as of 2015, investment in Argentina is the lowest as a share of output when compared to other economies in Latin America. Under staff’s baseline, the investment rate is expected to pick up gradually over time, consistent with a study of past cases of investment rebounds in Macroeconomic Assumptions (Percent change)20152016201720182019Real GDP growthFund staff2.5-1.82.72.82.9Authorities2.4-1.53.53.53.5Total consumptionFund staff4.1-1.82.32.72.7Authorities5.3-0.93.53.63.7InvestmentFund staff4.2-3.68.27.27.2Authorities5.5-3.514.49.57.6ExportsFund staff-0.64.54.44.83.8Authorities-0.46.97.76.05.2 ImportsFund staff5.61.36.87.66.3Authorities5.510.29.88.48.5Total consumption deflator (average)Fund staff25.638.024.519.115.3Authorities24.735.219.413.98.3Sources: Fund staff estimates and 2017 Budget proposal. Page 23 advanced and emerging economies, indicating that these rebounds generally take time to build and coincide with an improvement in the fiscal position (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper). However, with Argentina re- establishing itself in international markets and with the important efforts to remove domestic distortions already taken this year, private investment (largely financed from abroad and in both tradable sectors and domestic infrastructure) could prove to be much stronger than is assumed in the baseline. This would imply less need for fiscal support to growth and more room for maneuver to both reduce the fiscal deficit and to disinflate the economy with relatively modest output costs. A more successful tax amnesty . Increased disclosure and information sharing requirements across tax jurisdictions have the potential to create strong incentives to declare assets under the tax amnesty. This would lead to more tax revenues and, insofar as offshore funds of residents are repatriated into government bonds, would meet some of the budget financing needs. A stronger than expected recovery in Brazil. The October 2016 World Economic Outlook assumes Brazil’s growth to rebound to 0.5 percent in 2017 after the 3.3 percent contraction in 2016. Brazil accounts for about 20 percent of overall Argentina’s exports and 50 percent of its manufacturing exports, so each 1 percentage point increase in Brazil’s growth above the 2017 forecast would add an estimated ¼ percentage points to Argentina’s growth. Downside risks The gradual pace at which macroeconomic imbalances are resolved leaves Argentina vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks: A tightening of external financial conditions. Given the significant gross external borrowing needs of the government, an exogenous tightening of global capital markets could prove very disruptive. At best, a higher cost of financing would worsen debt dynamics and necessitate a stronger fiscal correction over the medium term. At worst, a sudden stop to external borrowing (e.g., owing to higher global risk aversion) could create financing shortfalls. With limited recourse to domestic financing, this could necessitate a more front-loaded fiscal adjustment at a time when external demand would also likely be weakening. Such a downside would create depreciation pressures on the currency and cause the central bank to react procyclically to contain inflation. The relatively high share of short-term foreign currency debt in a few non-financial private sector industries also poses rollover risks (see Annex I). Page 24 Risk Assessment Matrix RelativeLikelihoodHigh A reassessment of global risk leads to portfolio rebalancing, lowering capital flows into risk assets, including EMs. This would limit availability of funding of Argentina's fiscal needs through external bond issuances and repatriation of funds by non-bank domestic private sector. Domestic financial sector's funding could increase, but given its small size it would not be able to meet the gross financing needs of the federal government (11 percent of GDP in 2017). Tighter global financial conditions and limited capital inflows would require a more accelerated reduction of the fiscal deficit. Medium Upward pressures on inflation emerge because of higher wage growth and/or higher persistence in inflation and/or stronger second round effects from increase in tariffs. The currency could become more overvalued, and expectations of a future depreciation might increase, which would fuel inflation expectations and lower the demand for the peso.Facing a wage-price spiral and the risk of a run on the peso, the central bank should react by increasing interest rates. A faster reduction of the fiscal deficit may also be needed to immediately reduce inflationary pressures. High Continued appreciation of the currency leads to a worsening of the current peso misalignment, a deterioration of the external position, and renewed bouts of balance of payments pressures. A sharp devaluation of the currency realigns the currency and alleviates the pressures, leading to a jump in inflation and an immediate contraction of economic activity with high social costs, as household’s purchasing power is reduced. High FX exposure of the public sector can lead to a spike in public sector debt and financing difficulties. The central bank would need to increase interest rates to defend the peso, while fiscal policy could be tightened and re-oriented to protect the most vulnerable segments of society at zero cost for the budget (for example, though a faster elimination of energy subsidies, using the resources to fund means-tested transfers). Medium Weaker activity in China would impact Argentina primarily through trade channels, including through a negative impact on the terms of trade, as commodity prices would fall. This would affect especially soy sector, as about 3/4 of Argentina's soybean exports is destined to China. Staff estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point decrease in China's growth would lower Argentina's export growth by 0.4–0.7 percentage points. Slower growth in China would also affect Argentina indirectly, through its negative impact on the region, particularly on Brazil. ‧ The depreciation of the peso would help the economy adjust to the terms of trade shock. ‧ If needed, monetary and fiscal policy stances could be relaxed (fiscal policy could be re-oriented to protect the most vulnerable segments of society). ‧ The authorities could accelerate structural reforms to increase export competitiveness and diversification. High Private investment and FDI could be higher than expected reflecting stronger confidence effect. Also, export growth could be stronger reflecting more positive impact of current and capital account liberalization. A combination of stronger investment and exports could boost growth to 4½ percent in 2017, if private investment increases by at least one standard deviation of its historical average. ‧ The authorities could take advantage of the stronger GDP path to accelerate the pace of reduction of the fiscal deficit and to implement supply-side reforms, especially those that entail short-term costs, like elimination of subsidies and other forms of protection to specific sectors of the economy. High A stronger recovery of Brazil would have important positive spillover effects on Argentina's economy. The Brazilian market is especially relevant for Argentine industrial exports. More than 45 percent of exports of industrial manufactures go to Brazil. Staff estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in Brazil's growth would boost Argentina's export growth by 0.7 percentage points, and has a peak impact of ¼ percent on Argentina's growth. ‧ The authorities could take advantage of the stronger GDP path to accelerate the pace of reduction of the fiscal deficit and to implement supply-side reforms, especially those that entail short-term costs, like elimination of subsidies and other forms of protection to specific sectors of the economy. High Based on a comparison of past experience in Argentina and abroad, it is assumed that US$30 billion of wealth is declared, generating US$1.9 billion in additional tax revenues and US$2.6 billion in budgetary financing. However, increased disclosure and information sharing requirements in foreign banks, particularly in Europe, have the potential to significantly increase the incentive to declare funds. More optimistic estimates range between US$40–100 billion. In such an upside scenario, there would be a pick up in fiscal revenues and less need for government debt issuance. The smaller crowding out of the private sector could lead to greater private investment and growth. ‧ The authorities could take advantage of greater fiscal revenues and stronger GDP growth to accelerate the pace of reduction of the fiscal deficit and to implement supply-side reforms, especially those that entail short-term costs, like elimination of subsidies and other forms of protection to specific sectors of the economy. Source of RisksExpected ImpactPolicy Response Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions MediumDownside Risks Stronger recovery in Brazil Medium 1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. Higher and more persistent inflation Medium Significant China slowdown Low (in the short run) Stronger rebound of private investment and exports due to a more positive impact of liberalization measures MediumMedium A sudden depreciation of the currency Upside Risks High A more successful tax amnesty Page 25 A sudden depreciation of the currency. The continued real appreciation of the peso under staff’s baseline could make the economy vulnerable to an abrupt correction of a currency misalignment. In Argentina’s own history, episodes of a persistently overvalued real exchange rate have eventually led to a sharp devaluation of the currency. Such a sudden correction could lead to a contraction of economic activity and high social costs, as the resulting jump in inflation reduces household’s purchasing power. While the low FX exposure of Argentina’s private sector limits the risk of severe balance sheet effects, the significant (and increasing) FX exposure of the public sector poses a risk to the public debt dynamics. For example, a 10 percent depreciation of the real exchange rate would add about 3½ percent of GDP to the public debt. Higher and more entrenched inflation . Higher nominal wage increases in the forthcoming collective wage negotiations and second-round effects from the increase in utilities tariffs that are scheduled to be implemented would add to inflationary pressures. This could translate into increased concerns about macroeconomic stability, including through a loss of international competiveness, and potentially trigger capital outflows and downward pressure on the currency. Monetary policy would need to react to re-establish a nominal anchor which could further eat into economic activity. Authorities’ view GDP growth in 2017–19 is expected to accelerate more strongly than in staff’s baseline. Investment and export growth are expected to rebound more rapidly than assumed by staff. The reforms taken in 2016 amount to a significant total factor productivity shock, and are expected to generate a significant rebound of economic activity, reversing the decrease of potential output and income per capita over the past decade. Inflation. Reaching the inflation target 12–17 percent at end-2017 does not look ambitious, as inflation expectations are now at levels consistent with year-over-year inflation being quite close to the central bank’s (BCRA’s) target next year. The authorities noted that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to lower inflation to the target range and that expectations are likely to become more forward-looking as wage and price setters increasingly understand the BCRA’s strong commitment to achieve the announced inflation targets. They also noted that the increase in nominal wages needed to stabilize real wages at last year level varies across sectors. A lower cost of capital and a better economic environment make up space for real wage increases. In short, the authorities do not see a risk to their disinflation path stemming from wage negotiations. EE aa Page 26 Exchange rate. The authorities are confident that the adoption of an IT monetary policy regime with freely floating exchange rate will minimize the risk of currency misalignment as experienced in the past. A strong currency should not deter the rebound of investment, given the improved business conditions, productivity enhancing measures, and the abundance of capital at a time where there is excess saving at a global level. Risks. The authorities view the risks to their outlook as mostly on the upside. Removing the pervasive distortions that were affecting trade and investment has the potential to generate an ever sharper rebound of productivity and investment, which means there is a large upside risk to their growth projections.
