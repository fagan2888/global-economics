Vanuatu is a small island developing state and a low-income country recovering from Cyclone Pamâ€™s devastating damages . Its income per capita is about USD3,000, with tourism and agriculture the leading drivers of economic activity. Real GDP growth has floundered since 2010 with the average of the last 5 years declining below 2 percent per year from above 5 percent in the previous 5 years. At end-2015, Vanuatu experienced moderate public debt (25.6 percent of GDP), adequate reserves (7.1 months of imports), low inflation (2.5 percent), and relatively high private sector credit (around 70 percent of GDP). Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu in March 2015, causing damages estimated at around 60 percent of GDP . The extent of the damages appears to exceed that of any natural disaster experienced in the region in recent memory. In June 2015, the IMF Board approved a disbursement of about USD11.9 million under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF, at zero interest rate) and an equal disbursement under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI; IMF Country Report No. 15/149). This financial assistance was intended to help Vanuatu cope with its immediate balance of payments needs and to catalyze critical donor support for the recovery. At the same time the country was facing major political challenges which contributed to slowing down reconstruction . In October 2015, several members of parliament, including 5 ministers, were accused of bribery (11 were convicted). As a result, 14 seats in the 52- member Parliament were vacated and President Lonsdale dissolved the Parliament and called for early elections. The last Parliamentary elections in January 2016 produced a fractious legislature with 17 parties. iji K Y Page 10
