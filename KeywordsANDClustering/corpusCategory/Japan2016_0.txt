Abenomics met with initial success in tackling two decades of mild deflation and weak growth . Strong coordination between the Bank of Japanâ€™s (BoJ) unprecedented quantitative and qualitative easing program and fiscal stimulus combined with an announcement of ambitious structural reforms helped narrow the large output gap, reversed the undue appreciation of the yen, eased financial conditions, boosted corporate profits, lifted actual and expected inflation into positive territory, improved corporate governance and boosted labor force participation. The economy reached full employment and modest, but historically significant, increases in base wages took hold. Progress was made with fiscal consolidation. Three years after its introduction Abenomics needs a significant policy upgrade Inflation has lost its forward momentum and the BoJ has repeatedly pushed out its timeline for hitting its inflation target. Public debt remains unsustainable while record corporate profits and rising employment have failed to generate sufficient base wage growth. Investment and consumption growth remain weak amid uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook and real income. Finally, the global trade slowdown and effects of production offshoring have prevented exports from benefitting substantially from the weak yen while the sharp fall in oil prices has put downward pressure on headline inflation. To overcome these headwinds and safeguard against associated risks, Abenomics needs a comprehensive upgrade.
