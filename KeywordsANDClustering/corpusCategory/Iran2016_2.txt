Economic growth rebounded in 2016/17 on the back of higher oil production but non- oil activity remained weak (Table 1, Figure 1). Boosted by the swift recovery in oil production and exports, real GDP grew by 7.4 percent in the first half 2016/17, recovering from recession in 2015/16. However, non-oil sector growth averaged just 0.9 percent reflecting continued difficulties in access to finance and depressed consumption. Unemployment had risen to 12.7 percent by the end-Q2 (Table 2). RecommendationsStatus Lowering the non-oil fiscal deficit.The central government non-oil fiscal deficit reached 9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2015/16.Building fiscal buffers.

IMF technical assistance on tax administration and policy provided.Deepen subsidy reform.3 million high-income households removed from the cash transfer beneficiary list. Fuel prices last adjusted in May 2016. Reduce inflation and strengthen monetary framework.Inflation < 10 percent. Draft central bank bill makes stable inflation core objective.Address pressures on interest rates by Unlicensed Financial Institutions (UFIs) Most UFIs are now under CBI supervision; problem UFIs closed/merged with banks.Strengthening supervisory powers.Draft banking bill strengthens CBI's supervisory powers and makes unlicensed banking a criminal offense. IFRS reporting standards implemented. Resolve non-performing loans (NPLs)Audit of government arrears underway. New marketable government securities issued to settle payment arrears against tax obligations.Bolster provisions and capital Banks to retain profits and raise capital from shareholders. Budget approved use of part of CBI's FX revaluation gains to recapitalize some public banks. Strengthening the AML/CFT frameworkCFT Law approved in March 2016. In June 2016, the FATF suspended counter-measures for 12 months to monitor Iran’s progress in implementing its action plan to address AML/CFT deficiencies. The authorities requested IMF assessment of the AML/CFT framework in 2018.Improve business climate and address high unemploymentIran's ranking in the World Bank Doing Business indicator has improved marginally from 57.1 percent in 2016 (distance to frontier, 100 percent = best) to 57.2 percent in 2017, while its global competitiveness index remained stable at 57.6 percent.Source: IMF staff.

Inflation fell to a multi-year low of 6.8 percent y/y in June 2016, down from a peak of 45 percent in June 2013 reflecting favorable food prices and prudent policies. Inflation has since hovered in the 9½ percent range on higher world food prices and faster liquidity growth. M2 had risen by 28.3 percent y/y by end-December 2016 driven by CBI support to banks and the government drawing on its revolving facility. Iran’s external position strengthened (Tables 3–4, Figure 3). The current account surplus reached a recent low of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015/16 owing to low oil prices and curtailment of oil exports by sanctions. With the lifting of sanctions, higher oil exports and more favorable oil prices, the current account surplus is expected to rise to 6 percent of GDP in 2016/17. Renewed foreign investor inflows in the hydrocarbon, automobile and telecom industries are boosting FDI. The authorities are improving trade opportunities, by clearing arrears to export credit guarantee agencies and negotiating trade agreements with regional partners. The foreign exchange market experienced some volatility towards end-2016 . Through October 2016, the official exchange rate had depreciated by about 7 percent y/y from end-2015, whereas the market rate remained broadly steady. Over the remainder of 2016, the market rate depreciated sharply reflecting seasonal factors and the rise in sanctions-related uncertainty. It then recovered in January 2017 and the spread between the official and the market rate narrowed to 15 percent. Preparations for exchange rate unification have continued. Over half of all import categories have been shifted to the bureau market. Banks have been permitted to use non-oil export proceeds to fund imports to aid the re-creation of an interbank FX market. Monetary and fiscal policy have strived to support the recovery (Tables 5–11). Interest rate caps on one-year deposits were cut from 18 to 15 percent, and lending rates from 20 to 18 percent. Banks were instructed to allocate at least 10 percent of their loans to small and medium- sized enterprises and manufacturing. Statutory reserves requirements were selectively reduced from 13 to 10 percent based on banks’ asset quality and risk management. However, in the face of high nonperforming loans (NPLs), real interest rates remain high. The non-oil fiscal deficit of the central (general) government increased from 8.2 (11) percent of non-oil GDP in 2014/15 to 9.0 (11.5) percent in 2015/16 and is projected to rise to 10.6 (13.4) percent in 2016/17 as improved tax collections prove insufficient to fully offset higher current spending and transfers to the Targeted Subsidy Organization (TSO). The overall central (general) government fiscal deficit is estimated to increase from 1.8 (2.9) percent of GDP in 2015/16 to 3.1 (3.2) percent of GDP by end-2016/17. However, the 2017/18 central government budget submitted to parliament targets a zero balance due to higher oil receipts. The TSO administers revenues from domestic fuel sales to finance universal cash transfers. Page 13 Figure 2.

NPLs are high (about 12 percent), but would be significantly higher were it not for recent regulations permitting the rollover of overdue loans into new loans contingent on a partial repayment. The implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in banks in 2016 shows that the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the banking system has declined from 8.4 percent in March 2012 to 5.8 percent in March 2015. It also revealed substantial capital needs in state-owned banks (16 percent of total assets) where the average CAR is negative. Profitability remains constrained by the high cost of funds—some banks are competing aggressively for deposits by offering rates above the mandated caps and the interbank market rate remains at around 19 percent—and the lending rate cap. The authorities are starting to address financial system weakness . Most notably, the CBI has restructured and brought most UFIs under its supervision, addressing an important source of financial instability. The CBI has requested banks to retain profits and raise capital. The proposed Banking Bill enhances the supervisory tool-kit by providing for consolidated supervision and an array of corrective measures. The government also started issuing market bonds to secure its payment arrears to banks, and approved the use of part of the CBI’s foreign exchange revaluation gains to help settle banks’ debt vis-à-vis the CBI.
