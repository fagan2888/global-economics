Under the baseline of a Remain vote, policies should focus on promoting steady growth while reducing vulnerabilities. In particular, monetary policy should remain on hold until inflationary pressures are clearer and to help offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation. The latter should remain sufficiently gradual to avoid overburdening monetary policy and be supported by further efforts to make the composition of fiscal consolidation more pro-growth and pro-stability. To ensure financial stability, it will be important to complete implementation of the ambitious financial supervisory reform agenda and to have a robust and intrusive approach to supervision and regulation as the financial cycle matures and memories of the crisis fade. Of note, mortgage-related macroprudential policies will need to tighten later this year if the recent re-acceleration of housing and mortgage markets persists. Such a monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policy mix should help maintain growth while reducing vulnerabilities, including by supporting orderly current account adjustment, and should be reinforced by structural reforms to boost productivity and incomes. Policies will also need to remain flexible and adjust appropriately if circumstances change and risks are realized.
