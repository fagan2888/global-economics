The economy continues to grow fast in 2013/14 on the heels of very strong real GDP growth in 2012/13 . Based on the preliminary information on crop and cereal production and industrial production spurred by large-scale public and foreign direct investments, staff projects the economic growth in the 8.0–8.5 percent range in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Staff projections incorporate a downward adjustment from official figures to take into account the uncertainty around the underlying growth rate due to weaknesses in the national account statistics. The authorities’ projections are more optimistic (in the 11.0–11.4 percent range). Fiscal policy at the general government level remains cautious . The general government budget execution in 2013/14 reflects conservative spending. Recurrent spending is estimated to remain at 7.4 percent of GDP, and the capital spending-to-GDP ratio will only increase by about 0.3 percentage points to 11.0 percent of GDP. Although tax revenue-to-GDP is estimated to improve in 2013/14, the overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from about 14.6 in 2012/13 to about 14.1 in 2013/14, mainly on account of nontax revenue, as state-owned enterprises were allowed to retain earnings for reinvestment instead of paying dividends to the government. The staff estimates the general government budget deficit, including grants, to be 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14, compared to 2.0 percent of GDP a year ago. Public enterprises continue to provide an expansionary impulse, absorbing much of available credit and foreign exchange . They borrowed heavily from the banking system and externally to finance their investments. Banking system credit flow to public enterprises in the first ten months of 2013/14 was some 4 percent of GDP, not taking into account non-bank financing of Page 8 the Grand Renaissance Dam. Based on the first ten months of the current fiscal year, external borrowing by these enterprises is likely to reach 3.3 percent of GDP for the year. Consequently, the financing of the overall public sector is likely to have been on the order of 10 percent of GDP. Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is estimated to increase to about 23 percent of GDP in 2013/14 from 20.5 percent of GDP in 2012/13. Tight monetary policy has supported achieving the NBE’s inflation objective in . Inflation remained in the single digits throughout the year and was 8.5 percent in June 2014, with food prices rising by 6.2 percent and non-food inflation stubbornly in the double-digits. Base money, the nominal anchor of the monetary policy, increased by 17.5 percent in April 2014, driven mainly by claims on government (by 19.6 percent) and to lower degree by claims on non-government (by 11.2 percent). Other items net (OIN) contracted significantly, reflecting the redemption of the National Bank of Ethiopia’s (NBE’s) certificates of deposit (CDs) issued to private banks in 2013 to offset the potential liquidity injection from a reduction in the reserve requirements. The developments in the external sector present a mixed picture, with a substantial deterioration in the trade balance offset by net inflows on services and transfers . The weakening of trade balance reflects a sharp decline in the price and volume of Ethiopia’s main commodity goods (coffee and gold) due to subdued external demand conditions. This was offset, however, by solid volume growth in other exports such as oilseeds, pulses, leather products, live animals, and flowers. Demand for imports remained strong, driven by the investment-led economic growth. Imports of goods are estimated to increase by 12.7 percent in 2013/14, led by fertilizers, petroleum products, and capital goods. Expanding services exports partly made up for the large trade deficit . Transportation and travel service exports performed well in 2013/14, boosted by the aggressive expansion of Ethiopian Airlines and growing tourism. Private and official transfers also increased in FY2013/14, reflecting continuing strong growth in remittances. The current account deficit, nonetheless, is estimated to have widened from US$2.8 billion (6.0 percent of GDP) in 2012/13 to US$3.5 billion in 2013/14 (7.1 percent of GDP). It was financed largely by concessional and non-concessional inflows as well as by foreign direct investment (FDI). Substantial inflows on the capital account also facilitated a modest build up in the NBE’s reserves. Non-food inflation has been driven mostly by higher cost of housing, water, electricity and gas. In March 2013, after lowering reserve requirements on deposits from 10 to 5 percent, the NBE issued CDs to sterilize liquidity. Holdings of CDs were recorded under OIN, and all the commercial banks were obligated to allocate the difference stemming from the lowering of reserve requirements in the NBE’s instrument. The CDs held by private commercial banks with 1 year maturity were redeemed in March and April 2014, returning liquidity to the system. Page 9 Despite import-related demand for foreign exchange, the exchange rate adjusted only gradually, in line with the NBE’s managed float policy . While the premium in the parallel market remained modest (4.6 percent in May), the gradual nominal depreciation was likely insufficient to address excess demand for foreign exchange, and prevent an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and loss of competitiveness.
