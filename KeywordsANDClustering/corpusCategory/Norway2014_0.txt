A conservative minority government took office in October 2013, ending eight years of Labor party-led governments. No major policy shift has taken place so far, but the government’s economic policy platform emphasizes lower taxes, more infrastructure investment, greater private ownership, and measures to improve productivity and competitiveness. New challenges are emerging as oil-related investment is peaking and competitiveness concerns are becoming more pressing. Both mainland and offshore growth slowed in 2013 (Figures 1 and 2). Mainland growth moderated to 2.0 percent in part due to weak private consumption and mainland investment, and lower oil production kept offshore growth down. Households have increased their savings rate significantly in recent years, partly reflecting concerns about elevated debt levels. GDP Growth (Y/Y percent change) Mainland Total Unemployment remains low in spite of a growing labor force (Figure 3). The unemployment rate edged up slightly in the last year, but remains low at around 3.5 percent, notwithstanding net immigration that has added nearly 1 percent annually to the population in recent years and accounted for most of the gains in net employment (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper on immigration and potential output).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Page 9 correction that would bring house prices back to estimated equilibrium levels would trigger a decline in consumption by 4 percent (See 2013 Nordic Regional Report, Selected Issues). Inflation rose toward the target partly due to last year’s exchange rate depreciation. The Norwegian krone depreciated by 10 percent in nominal effective terms in 2013, and this pushed the main inflation index (CPI-ATE) to about 2.5 percent early this year after several years below the target (Figures 4). Annual Inflation of CPI Components Imported Consumer Goods Domestic Consumer Goods CPI-ATE 2.5 percent target The 2013 fiscal outturn was well within the authorities’ fiscal policy rule. The structural non-oil deficit was 3.1 percent of GPFG assets and 5.1 percent of trend mainland GDP. However, the fiscal impulse (i.e., the change in the structural non-oil deficit as a share of mainland GDP) was slightly positive and lower than expected at 0.2 percent. Sources: Norges Bank and Fund staff calculations. The overall current account surplus remains high at 14 percent of mainland GDP but declined in 2013 partly due to weaker petroleum exports. The non-oil trade deficit has been gradually rising and worsened further in 2013 (Figure 5). Terms of trade growth, which had been supporting the economy in recent years, also slowed in 2013.

The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) is about 5 percent below its 10-year historical average, reflecting the recent depreciation of the Norwegian krone (Figure 5). However, REER deflated by unit labor costs (ULC) appreciated significantly over the past decades. The recent depreciation only modestly offsets the erosion of competitiveness, and non-oil export market share continued to decline (Figure 6).

Norway CET1 Requirements (Percent of risk-weighted assets) Maximum Countercyclical Buffer Countercyclical Buffer Buffer for Systemically Important Banks Systemic Risk Buffer Capital Conservation Buffer Minimum Requirement Banks’ profitability has improved and capital ratios have strengthened. All major banks meet the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement of 10 percent, although some banks will need to raise capital to meet the overall capital requirement of 13.5 percent in mid-2015 (14.5 percent for systemically- important banks). The return on equity for the largest banking groups rose to 14 percent in 2013 Q3. Banks continue to rely on wholesale funding, mostly in the form of covered bonds, and many banks still have some way to go before meeting the likely Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement. However, many banks still do not meet the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR).

Inward links are mainly from Swedish and Danish banks with combined market shares of a quarter to a third. The largest domestically-headquartered bank, DNB, has relatively small external operations concentrated in Nordic and Baltic countries and the shipping industry. More information on these links is in the Nordic Regional Report and the Baltic Cluster Report from 2013 and 2014 respectively and their accompanying selected issues papers. A Financial Sector Assessment Program mission is planned for late 2014/early 2015 for discussion with the 2015 Article IV consultation. Because Norway’s financial sector is considered to be systemically important, subsequent financial stability assessments are expected to take place every five years. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Page 13 Box 1. External Stability, Competitiveness, and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) The CPI-based REER appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Reflecting recent nominal depreciation, the CPI-based REER is slightly below the 10-year historical average at end-2013.

CA gap (percent of GDP) REER gap 1/ EBA (External Balance Assessment). CA gaps: minus indicates overvaluation. REER gaps: minus indicates undervaluation. REER deviations between -10 and +10 mean the real exchange rate (RER) is close to balance. EBA estimates are based on data available in April 2014. broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies: While the real exchange rate approach shows no significant misalignment, the macroeconomic balance approach suggests a mild undervaluation and the external sustainability model points to the opposite. However, the ULC-based REER suggests an erosion of long-term cost competitiveness. Norway’s ULC- based REER has appreciated significantly for the past two decades, reflecting strong wage growth, and real ULCs have doubled since 1995. The recent depreciation of the Norwegian krone has reduced the overvaluation at the margin, but the ULC-based REER is still roughly 60 percent higher than the 1995 level. This has been offset by terms of trade gains, but there is no reason to expect these to persist indefinitely. The declining non-oil export market share also suggests weakening competitiveness. Robust GDP growth driven by high oil prices and large terms of trade gain has masked slowing productivity growth in recent years. Despite the fiscal rule, the insulation from the Dutch disease effects does not seem to have been complete. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Page 14 Figure 6.
