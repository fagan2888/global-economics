Implementation of the CRD IV/Basel III requirements is moving well ahead of the schedule required by Basel III (Figure 9). All large Norwegian banks already meet the CET1 capital requirement, effective from July 2014. Counter-cyclical capital buffers will go into effect from end-June 2015 (see Box 2). Three financial institutions have been designated as domestic systemically important banks. These banks account for more than 45 percent of lending, and they will be subject to an additional capital surcharge of one percent in mid-2015 that will rise to 2 percent one year later. While DNB and other larger commercial banks meet the likely LCR requirement as of 2013 Q3, many savings banks still have some way to go to meet the LCR in its current form. Changes in risk weights for mortgages are also underway. The government raised the minimum loss-given-default (LGD) risk model parameter from 10 percent to 20 percent in October 2013. The risk weights for residential mortgages ranged from 10-15 percent before, and a minimum LGD requirement of 20 percent is expected to increase the average risk weighting of residential mortgage loans to about 20 percent. The same capital requirements for mortgages are expected to apply to branches of Danish and Swedish banks through agreements among the Nordic authorities, however the details of how this will be done are still being worked out. This should result in these foreign branches lending in line with the regulatory framework in Norway. Staff supported tighter capital standards for mortgage lending for both domestic and foreign banks and the efforts to harmonize prudential standards among Nordic countries. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in the financial system remain. Stricter capital requirements and tightening of loan-to-value (LTV) limits seem to have helped contain the increase in house prices, but valuations are still high (Box 3). Banks continue to rely on wholesale funding, and the deposit-to-loan ratio has not improved much. In this context, tighter capital standards and LTV limits on mortgages should be maintained even if house prices weaken further, and tighter limits on interest-only mortgage loans should be considered.

Counter-cyclical Capital Buffers The Norges Bank is responsible under current regulations for providing advice to the Government, on the use of the countercyclical capital buffer in consultation with the FSA. The Ministry of Finance sets the level of the countercyclical capital buffer on a quarterly basis. The buffer will be set at between 0 and 2.5 percent of banks’ risk-weighted assets. The Norges Bank issued its first advice on the countercyclical capital buffer in December 2013. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance set the buffer at 1 percent in line with Norges Bank’s recommendation. It will become effective from end-June 2015. The counter cyclical capital buffer will eventually apply to all banks operating in Norway, but it will apply to branches of foreign banks after 2016. The Norges Bank formulates its advice mostly based on four indicators: (i) the ratio of total credit to mainland GDP; (ii) the wholesale funding ratio of Norwegian credit institutions; (iii) the ratio of house prices to household disposable income; and (iv) commercial property prices. These indicators are compared with their historical trends, which are estimated with various methods, and the difference between indicators and trends is used as a measure of financial imbalances. These indicators gave a buffer guide of ¼ to 1¾ percent in mid-2013. The Norges Bank’s final recommendation of 1 percent took into account other regulatory changes being implemented at the same time, the fact that imbalances were no longer building up, and the somehow slower growth in the Norwegian economy. The current set of indicators is expected to be expanded over time as more experience is gained. The Norges Bank’s advices will also take account of EU recommendations from the European Systemic Rick Board.

Various factors have been contributing to rising house prices, including high income and wage growth, immigrant inflows, and supply constraints. Nevertheless, there are signs of overvaluation with a sustained increase in the price-to- income ratio and a large deviation in the price-to-rent ratio from its historical average. Staff’s updated estimates on house price valuation gaps, based on the three measures of valuation used in the background papers for the 2013 Nordic Regional Report and Norway Article IV report, suggest a slight correction in the degree of overvaluation in 2013, but prices remain above equilibrium by varying degrees according to different estimates. The authorities have taken various measures to contain increases in house prices in recent years. The FSA introduced guidelines in March 2010 that set recommended limits on loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to- income (LTI) ratios for mortgages. The FSA further lowered the cap on the LTV ratio on mortgages to 85 percent in December 2011, along with other tightening measures. Higher risk-weights on mortgage lending are also being implemented. In October 2013, the Ministry of Finance raised the minimum loss-given-default (LGD) risk model parameter from 10 percent to 20 percent. The risk weights for residential mortgages have on average ranged from 10–15 percent before. A minimum LGD requirement of 20 percent is expected to increase the average risk weighting of residential mortgage loans to about 20 percent. Additional requirements for IRB-models are also being considered. While it is difficult to disentangle the impact of prudential measures on house prices from other factors, these measures may have helped to dampen house price growth. For example, new loans exceeding the FSA-recommended 85 percent LTV limit fell to 17 percent in 2012 in spite of robust income growth and falling unemployment, suggesting that the LTV cap may have started to have some impact.

New capital adequacy regulation for banks adopted by the parliament in June 2013 contains a set of macroprudential tools and powers, which are already in place to increase capital levels for Norwegian banks. Nevertheless it is still important to follow up Norwegian banks’ capital adequacy, to ensure that they are well prepared to meet downturns in the economy. The Nordic cooperation will continue, including the efforts to improve comparability among Nordic banks and facilitate transparency and market discipline.
