Anchored in strong fiscal rules and discipline, the fiscal position is healthy. The general governmentâ€™s budget was close to balance in 2013, as small deficits at the federal and cantonal level were offset by a surplus in the social security funds. The federal balance deteriorated somewhat relative to 2012 because of higher subsidies, grants, and social benefits, but deficits in cantons and municipalities were reduced from the previous year. Previous reforms to unemployment insurance and a VAT increase earmarked for invalidity pensions allowed the social security funds to remain in surplus. In 2014, the fiscal stance is expected to be broadly neutral. The general government should record a small deficit largely reflecting the lack of a profit distribution from the SNB and one- off restructuring contributions towards cantonal pension funds. Going forward, cantonal finances will be under some pressure because of the continuing need to raise the funding ratio of cantonal pension funds and changes in the hospital financing scheme. In addition, the corporate tax reform which is envisaged to enter into force as of 2018 is likely to lead to a revenue loss for cantons (see below). To prepare for the potential revenue loss as part of the burden sharing agreement with cantons, the federal government plans to restrain spending and implement a consolidation package. All in all, the structural balance should remain close to zero beyond 2014, with deficits at the cantons and communes level offset by surpluses in the federal government and social security funds. The debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to 44 percent of GDP in 2017 (on a GFSM-basis). From a medium-term perspective, spending pressures will arise from population aging and peak at about 4 percent of GDP by 2055.
