Output is estimated to have declined by 3.9 percent in 2015 as a result of the storm, and the recovery is now estimated to be slower and more protracted than in the RCF estimates. Tourism activities are returning to earlier levels following the resumption of full operations at the main airport. Visitor arrivals have recovered, although to levels that are lower than in the previous season, as a result of the storm and also because of a significant reduction in flights by the main regional airline as it restructures its operations. Other sectors have been slower to rebound, and will likely need more time to fully recover. In particular, agriculture output declined sharply as the storm affected crops and access to arable land, and significant areas are now in need of re- planting and soil treatment. Manufacturing is also significantly affected, as the storm prompted the closure of the main industrial plant. The protracted decline of banks’ credit to the private sector remains a drag on economic activity, underpinned by high non- performing loans (NPLs) — more than 15 percent of total loans — and low profitability. Inflation has remained subdued, within a slightly negative range on a year-on-year basis, mainly as a result of falling fuel prices.

Imports have been resilient despite the loss of incomes, supported by an increase in remittances, donor grants, and social transfers provided by the government, all of which contributed to sustain private consumption. On the other side, lower oil imports following the decline in international prices contributed to contain the current account deficit. The external position is assessed to be weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II). Structural impediments, domestic policy gaps relative to other countries, and the appreciation of the US dollar are dominant contributors to the REER gap. Imputed reserves are assessed to be adequate and sufficient to absorb most shocks. The fiscal outturn for FY 2015/16 is strong, but is partly explained by transitory factors. In the first half of FY2015/16 the central government balance registered a surplus of about 3percent of GDP. This performance was supported by the collection of tax arrears, and low capital expenditures, which are largely transitory, and also by higher Economic Citizenship Program (ECP) revenues, which are difficult to predict. The low capital spending is in part explained by the low level of capital grants and also by significant time needed for investment planning because of the need to re- prioritize the public investment program. In the second semester, revenues are expected to benefit from the adoption of the fiscal measures committed in the RCF, mainly increasing several excise taxes and user fees, and also reinstating specific import duties. On this basis, the fiscal balance is estimated at a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP. The estimated yield of measures already approved is 0.7 percent of GDP, above the target of 0.5 percent of GDP The balance of payments (BOP) data for 2014 were revised by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and Dominica’s Statistical Office from -13.1 percent of GDP to -11.2 percent of GDP. This reflects mainly the improved estimation of (i) tourism exports, (ii) transactions by offshore universities, and (iii) private remittances. Further improvements in BOP estimation are expected, particularly of FDI and portfolio flows by end-2016. This assessment does not consider the need for additional buffers to deal with significant natural disasters.

The significant improvement in revenue administration and tax auditing facilitated the identification of additional tax arrears, which is expected to broaden the tax base going forward. The state owned enterprises (SOEs) sector is affected by financial sustainability challenges. This sector is in general operationally balanced, but their resources are insufficient to cover capital replacement (text table). Their debt is significant, contributing 12 percent of GDP to the stock of public sector debt, and it is mostly concentrated in financial public entities (text table).
