The risk of debt distress is high, though baseline debt service indicators remain at comfortable levels (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Mainly reflecting the recent dollar appreciation and lower GDP growth and inflation, total nominal debt reached 125.8 percent of GDP. The present value (PV) of external debt to GDP reached 61.8 percent in 2015, exceeding the 50 percent threshold, and is projected to gradually decline to below 50 percent in the medium term (Figure 1). Debt sustainability remains highly sensitive to a depreciation shock. Tourism in Cabo Verde is mainly supply constrained and the growth projection reflects the expected expansion of capacity related to the very large pipeline of tourism related FDI as well as the expansion of airport capacities. Growth in goods exports reflects mainly an expansion of fish processing as the industry is currently operating well below capacity and seeking to increase the supply of fish. Page 13 Text Figure 1.
