Housing and mortgage markets have re-accelerated since mid-2015 Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, house-price growth decelerated somewhat, and the percentage of new mortgages with high loan-to-value (LTV) or high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios declined (Figure 3). This moderate deceleration in housing and mortgage markets may have partly reflected policy actions in mid-2014, including tougher mortgage lending requirements (the FCA’s Mortgage Market Review) and an FPC restriction that no more than 15 percent of a lender’s new mortgages be at or above a loan-to-income ratio of 4.5. Though the latter restriction was not binding for the vast majority of lenders, it may have had a signaling effect that prompted them to reduce high loan-to-income mortgages. In recent months, however, house-price growth has re-accelerated, reaching 9 percent in March 2016—more than three times income growth. The share of new mortgages at high LTI ratios has also started to tick back up (Figure 3) and remains well above pre-boom levels (i.e., circa 2000), as does the aggregate household debt-to-income ratio, which is above the levels in other G-7 countries and whose rate of decline has recently slowed. Such high leverage significantly exposes banks and households to interest-rate, income, and house-price shocks. However, the recent acceleration in housing markets could partly be a temporary response to tax changes . In particular, the acceleration may reflect an increased urgency to purchase dwellings before the April 1, 2016, implementation of a three percent stamp duty surcharge on properties that are not primary residences (e.g., buy-to-let properties). This view is supported by RICS data on expected house prices, which suggest a cooling of house prices going forward. 1601702000Q12002Q32005Q12007Q32010Q12012Q32015Q1 UK: Household Debt (Percent of disposable income)Source: Haver Analytics Jan-14Jun-14Nov-14Apr-15Sep-15Feb-16 UK UK: House Price Expectations over Next Three Months (Percent balance of respondents) Sources: RICS; and IMF staff calculations. -50510152025-50510152025Jan-12Nov-12Sep-13Jul-14May-15Mar-16 UK UK without LondonSources: ONS; and IMF staff calculations. UK: House Price Growth (Percent, y-o-y) Page 31 Macroprudential policies will need to be tightened later this year if the acceleration does not prove temporary . Given the uncertainty regarding the effects of recent tax changes and the referendum on EU membership on the housing market, it is prudent to wait for greater clarity on market conditions before taking further macroprudential tightening. However, if mortgage markets remain buoyant beyond this period, further macroprudential tightening (tighter LTI and/or LTV limits on new mortgages) will be needed later this year. Priority should also be given to the consolidation of household-level credit data to allow a shift from LTI limits to debt-to-income ones, which cannot be evaded by taking out multiple loans. Ensuring that macroprudential policies remain sufficiently tight to support financial stability should also promote higher household saving and current account adjustment. The buy-to-let (BTL) segment, which has grown rapidly in recent years, needs to be put on an equal regulatory footing with the owner-occupied segment . Since 2012, the stock of outstanding BTL mortgages has grown approximately four times as fast as the stock of mortgages in the owner-occupied segment, with BTL accounting for more than one-third of gross mortgage growth since 2012. The segment is dominated by small-scale landlords (owning 3 properties or less), who are significantly more sensitive to interest-rate increases than owner occupiers. The decline in rental yields, shown by the divergence between rents and house prices, magnifies this sensitivity, as BTL borrowers tend to rely on rental income to cover mortgage payments. Studies also find that the probability of default on BTL mortgages is higher than for owner-occupied mortgages and that BTL mortgages are typically extended on interest-only terms (BoE, 2015; McCann, 2014; HMT, 2015). Against this background, the authorities should extend the FPC’s powers of direction to the BTL market, as proposed by a recent Treasury consultation paper, to avoid biasing the market toward the BTL segment. The powers of direction should mirror those the FPC currently has over the owner- occupied market. Minimum underwriting standards for BTL mortgages should also be strengthened, as proposed by a recent PRA consultation paper. The proposed standards would include guidelines for testing the affordability of interest payments, including a minimum stressed interest rate to be used when lenders conduct affordability tests. Finally, the authorities should work to disseminate data on rental prices that are differentiated by region and the type of rented property in order to advance the analysis of the rental market, buy vs. rent decisions, and the extent of house price overvaluation. 80901001101201301401501601708090100110120130140150160170Jan-11Jan-12Jan-13Jan-14Jan-15Jan-16 House Prices UK House Prices London Rents UK Rents London UK: House Prices vs Rents (January 2011=100)Sources: Haver Analytics; and IMF staff calculations. 2007Q12008Q22009Q32011Q42012Q12013Q22014Q32015Q4 All mortgages Buy to let (RHS) UK: Outstanding Mortgage Balances Sources: Council of Mortgage Lenders; and IMF staff calculations. Page 32 Efforts should also continue to address supply constraints. A key cause of persistent high growth in house prices is constrained supply due to restrictive planning and the post-recession loss of building capacity. Increased housing supply would support near-term growth, reduce the need for excessive household leverage, and promote social cohesion by lessening wealth inequality. The government should thus build upon the recently undertaken initiatives to boost housing supply by further exploring ways in which mobilization of unused publicly-owned lands and property tax reform (see fiscal section above and 2015 Selected Issues) could ease supply constraints. The commercial real estate (CRE) market warrants careful monitoring Price growth was rapid during 2014–15, especially in prime London locations, where indicators point to some CRE overvaluation. Some indicators suggest a marked slowdown in early 2016, with transactions falling by 40 percent, though this likely reflects at least in part referendum- related uncertainty. CRE prices have important macro-financial implications, because many firms use CRE as collateral to support their borrowing. A fall in prices could thus tighten corporate credit constraints and reduce business investment and economic activity. A sharp reversal of CRE prices could also adversely affect financial stability via banks’ exposure to commercial real estate, though this channel has been lessened by a post-crisis rebalancing of CRE funding away from domestic banks towards international investors and nonbanks. However, this implies that adverse shocks to CRE may have significant negative outward spillovers via the sector’s cross-border financial linkages. The authorities noted that they continue to monitor real-estate related financial stability risks closely and will take further action as warranted . The authorities emphasized that the recent stamp duty change, action by the PRA (e.g., its consultation on BTL underwriting standards), and possible referendum-related effects made it difficult to ascertain underlying trends in the residential and commercial real estate markets and that the picture may clarify later this year. On the BTL market, the FPC has requested powers of direction. Following its recently completed consultation on the matter, the Treasury expected to publish a consultation response document, including final legislation, in the coming months. The PRA also expected to follow-up soon on its consultation on minimum underwriting standards for BTL mortgages. -10-505101520-10-505101520Mar-12Oct-12May-13Dec-13Jul-14Feb-15Sep-15 Aggregate United Kingdom Prime United Kingdom Prime London UK: Commercial Real Estate Price Growth (Percent, y-o-y)Sources: Haver Analytics; Bank of England; and IMF staff calculations.
