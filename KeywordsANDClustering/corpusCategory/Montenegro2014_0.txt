Montenegroâ€™s economy is highly dependent on tourism and FDI. It is suffering from relatively high public debt, unprofitable state companies, high levels of NPLs, and ongoing bank deleveraging. It faces challenges from an aging population and low employment. It is euroized and therefore lacks independent monetary policy, while flexibility is weak owing to a relatively rigid labor market. During the past two years, the government has implemented significant fiscal consolidation measures. But it has also committed to a highway investment project, of which the first phase is budgeted to cost EUR 809 million (24 percent of 2013 GDP) (Box 1). In December 2010, Montenegro received official candidate status for EU accession; negotiations are ongoing.
