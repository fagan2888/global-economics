Aruba is a highly open, tourism-dependent economy, with one of the highest living standards in the Caribbean (Box 1). Over 85 percent of the economy depends directly or indirectly on tourism, making Aruba the third most tourism-dependent country in the world. As a reflection of this marked dependence on external economic conditions, the volatility of Aruba’s growth has been among the highest in the region. However, the fixed exchange rate regime against the USD (unchanged since 1971), supported by conservative fiscal, credit, and prudential policies, ensured low inflation and had kept imbalances in check until recent years (Figure 1). The main policy challenge is rebuilding policy space while supporting the ongoing recovery . Repeated shocks have resulted in a double-dip recession which has eroded the authorities’ fiscal policy space. Public debt increased substantially to over 80 percent of GDP in 2014, a level beyond what is considered prudent for a small economy like Aruba which is highly vulnerable to external shocks. Steadfast fiscal consolidation, relying on both revenue and expenditure measures, is needed to durably set debt on a downward trajectory. Maintaining financial stability and safeguarding competitiveness, in part by advancing the structural reform agenda, would help ensure a steady recovery. Past Fund advice focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability through the development of a medium-term adjustment program. In particular, recommendations underscored the need to improve the financial situations of Aruba’s pension and health care schemes. The authorities undertook key entitlement reforms in 2014 and have presented a medium-term budget plan which aims to attain a small fiscal surplus by 2018. Notwithstanding these efforts, however, additional measures and determined implementation will be needed to achieve the authorities’ ambitious fiscal targets.
