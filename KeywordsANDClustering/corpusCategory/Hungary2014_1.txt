The economy has started to turn around in recent months. Following the 2012 recession, GDP posted 1.1 percent growth in 2013, with domestic demand as the main driver––for the first time since 2008. This largely reflected higher public spending, including on projects co-financed with the EU and––to a lesser extent––a recovery of private investment and consumption on the back of accommodative monetary conditions and improved market confidence. Better external conditions, alongside increased production capacity in the automotive industry, boosted exports and contributed to the widening in the current account surplus to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2013 from 1 percent in 2012. High frequency indicators suggest that growth remained strong in the first quarter of 2014. 2006 -Q12007 -Q32009 -Q12010 -Q32012 -Q12013 -Q3 Real GDP growth (yoy) Business confidence (Net balance, RHS) Real GDP growth and Business confidence Source: Haver. Page 7 Inflation has fallen to a record-low level. Against excess production capacity, utility price cuts, and a moderation of import prices, headline inflation decelerated sharply to 0.4 percent at end- 2013. More recently, it has remained around zero reflecting in part another round of utility price cuts. Core inflation and inflation expectations have decelerated as well, albeit more gradually, and have remained around the National Bank of Hungary’s (MNB) 3 percent inflation target. Unemployment has declined sharply, but labor market conditions are still weak. Labor market participation increased by about one percentage point to 65.1 percent at end-2013. At the same time, public works programs continued to expand (Box 2), with the number of registered individuals exceeding 400,000 (or about 10 percent of total employment) at end-2013. Largely as a result of this expansion, the unemployment rate declined to 9½ percent in 2013:Q4 from 11 percent (both seasonally-adjusted) in 2012:Q4. Meanwhile, job creation in the private sector has been weak and real wage growth in this sector moderated further to about 3 percent at end-2013. The fiscal deficit remained well below the EU limit in 2013. Following the substantial adjustment in 2012 (3½ percent of GDP) and additional measures in 2013 to ensure that the fiscal deficit remains below 3 percent of GDP, Hungary exited the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure in June 2013. With lower-than-budgeted tax revenues more than offset by strict expenditure control, the 2013 fiscal deficit (2.2 percent of GDP) over-performed the 2.7 percent target, thus keeping the policy stance broadly neutral. Public debt declined only slightly to just above 79 percent of GDP. The central bank continued to ease monetary policy through both conventional and unconventional measures. Against decelerating inflation, low risk premia, and a negative output gap, the Monetary Council reduced the policy rate––albeit at a slowing pace––to a record-low level of 2.5 percent. Furthermore, the central bank introduced the Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS) with the aim of easing access to finance for SMEs and improving their credit conditions, inter alia through a subsidized lending interest rate (Box 3). After the implementation of the Scheme’s first phase under which the equivalent of 2.4 percent of GDP was lent by commercial banks, the MNB extended the Scheme with a possible increase in the allocated amount to up to 6.6 percent of GDP. The banking sector is still under pressure and bank balance sheets continued to contract. While aggregate capital and liquidity positions remained adequate, many banks posted losses for a third year in a row, due to high levels of NPLs (16.9 percent, 2013:Q4), weak economic activity, and a heavy tax burden. Portfolio cleaning remained sluggish, and speculation about future debt relief for FX mortgage holders has incentivized some borrowers to suspend their debt service payments, thereby adding further pressure on bank balance sheets.

The deleveraging process has brought the loan-to deposit ratio further down to 102 percent in 2013:Q4 from about 150 percent in early 2009, and contributed to a further decline in banks’ foreign funding. In an effort to boost the lending capacity of cooperative credit institutions, the government integrated them into a single body under the ownership of the state-owned Development Bank. The integration process is expected to be completed by end-2014 and is likely to add a key market player to the banking system.

The current account is in surplus, reflecting in part elevated savings in response to ongoing deleveraging, and external debt has fallen substantially. However, despite the decline, external debt is 119 percent of GDP, the net international position is at -93 percent of GDP, open FX positions on private sector balance sheets are about 21 percent of GDP; and gross external financing needs average 26 percent of GDP per year over the medium term. Moreover, reliance on nonresidents for local currency-denominated government securities continues, and such holdings stood at 32 percent of the end-March 2014 outstanding stock, with a high concentration in the investor base (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). Staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals . Econometric estimates based on the EBA methodology have low explanatory power and yield mixed results for Hungary. Specifically, the Current Account Balance approach suggests that the current account norm is a small deficit, about 5 percent of GDP below the cyclically- adjusted balance in 2013; thus, Hungary’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be undervalued. However, in staff’s view, this approach does not adequately capture savings (and therefore the current account) remaining elevated due to Hungary’s still-large external liabilities, and the need to substantially reduce them over the medium term. The Real Effective Exchange Rate approach reveals an overvaluation of the exchange rate by about 20 percent, and the External Sustainability approach finds the REER undervalued by just under 10 percent. Other price indicators, such as unit labor costs, do not point to competitiveness problems. The total assets of cooperative credit institutions amounted to €7.2 billion at end-2013, thus making the integrated body the fourth-largest in the banking system. The authorities’ plans to increase their loan-to-deposit ratio (currently 60 percent) would increase their importance in the banking system further. Page 9 However, non-price indicators point to an erosion in Hungary’s market share and attractiveness for FDI. After an impressive expansion in export markets starting in the mid-1990s, reflecting growing links with the German supply chain, Hungary’s export market share has been recently underperforming its regional peers (Box 4). At the same time, the FDI stock in manufacturing, which peaked at 23 percent of GDP in 2007, has declined sharply since then. Additionally, Hungary’s ranking in the global competitiveness index has slipped 11 places since 2010/11 (63 out of 148 in 2013/14), with the institutional framework providing a drag on overall competitiveness—transparency of government policy making, property rights, and public trust in politicians received exceptionally low ranking. Hungary withstood various bouts of emerging market turmoil over the past year relatively well. Financial markets seem to have taken confidence in the recent economic recovery, current account surplus, sizeable fiscal consolidation, and low headline inflation. Domestic issuance of government bonds has continued smoothly and yields––although increasing by 50–60 basis points toward end-2013––have eased somewhat recently. The exchange rate depreciated by 3½ percent against the euro in the first quarter of 2014 and has since been broadly stable, while the equity market recorded moderate losses (6 percent in 2014:Q1). Sovereign CDS spreads have moderated recently to just above 200 basis points (end-April). Taking advantage of favorable external conditions, the government secured financing for most of its maturing external debt in 2014 (US$7¼ billion, 5½ percent of GDP) with the US$2 billion and US$3 billion Eurobond placements in November 2013 and March 2014, respectively.
