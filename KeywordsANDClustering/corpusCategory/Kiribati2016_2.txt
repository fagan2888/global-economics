Prudent management of public resources remains the key policy priority. The authorities have made remarkable progress in strengthening the fiscal position. Reforms to improve the RERF governance have also been important steps towards better aligning its investment strategy with the fund’s long-term objectives. Nonetheless, the conditions underlying the strong fishing activity have started to wane. To support the government’s long run development agenda, budget decisions need to be taken in the context of a medium term fiscal framework with prudent assessment of spending goals, revenue projections and wealth management targets. Given the expected decline in fishing revenue and Kiribati’s susceptibility to climate change related shocks, this framework should embed adequate fiscal buffers which would likely imply saving much of the fishing revenue windfall. Further strengthening the RERF would also support the fund’s capacity to provide sustainable future income for intergenerational equity. = Page 12
