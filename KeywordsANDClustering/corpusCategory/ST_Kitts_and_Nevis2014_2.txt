The outlook is positive with growth expected to reach its potential over the medium term. Growth in 2014 is expected to accelerate to 2.7 percent, and continue to lead the ECCU countries, on the basis of the ongoing recovery in tourism—supported by an increase in air lift—and construction, the latter being fueled by CBI inflows and other new FDI and SIDF projects. The trend is expected to continue and somewhat strengthen, contingent on the recovery envisaged in key external tourism markets, sustained expansion of airline and hotel room capacity—the latter based on current construction activity, new projects supported by CBI inflows and the SIDF, and a rebound of consumer and business confidence. After being subdued in 2013 and 2014, inflation is expected to pick up slightly with the rebounding domestic demand. The current account deficit is projected to widen in 2014, based on a conservative assumption regarding CBI receipts. Without CBI receipts, the current account deficit would remain broadly unchanged in 2014 relative to 2013. Average growth during 1980-2012 was 3.9 percent. CBI inflows are difficult to forecast. The medium-term framework is based on the authorities’ projections of CBI applications fees falling sharply in 2014 to their 2011 share of GDP, reflected in their budget, and slowly declining thereafter. Nevertheless, preliminary information suggested that inflows in the first few weeks in 2014 are continuing at their 2013 level.

Risks to this projection are broadly balanced (Annex 1). Real GDP growth in St. Kitts and Nevis is closely related to economic developments in the U.S., and current uncertainty regarding U.S. fiscal policy and the volatility in emerging market economies pose a definite risk. Other factors that could undermine the recovery include the protracted parliamentary challenge that may adversely impact the business climate, a sudden rapid diminution of inflows related to the CBI program— including because of changes in the visa-free access for citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis—and natural disasters. At the same time, the large inflows under the CBI program could continue at their current rapid pace, increasing government revenues, creating additional fiscal space, and leading to higher growth through increased investment. Such inflow would need to be managed to avoid potential overheating. The authorities are keenly aware of their vulnerability to exogenous shocks, including natural disasters. They note that they are now in a much stronger position to deal with such shocks, based on their improved financial balances, the accumulation of some precautionary balances, and their conservative treatment of CBI inflows.
