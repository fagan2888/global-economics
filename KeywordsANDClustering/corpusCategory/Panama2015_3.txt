It is essential to finalize the action plan Panama agreed with the FATF (see the Risk Assessment Matrix in Annex II). Since the FATF identified Panama as having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies, many countries have instructed their financial institutions to scrutinize transactions linked to Panama. According to the authorities and private sector, maintaining correspondent relationships with foreign banks and conducting international trade and banking transactions has become more challenging, although with modest overall impact so far. The authorities are continuing to work on the action plan agreed with the FATF and have adopted legislative amendments aimed at expanding the list of predicate offenses to money laundering (ML), dealing with the freezing of terrorist assets, and strengthening preventative AML/CFT controls (particularly related to beneficial ownership). Staff commended the authorities for their significant efforts. In particular, the passing of a new anti-money laundering law in April 2015 is an important step. Now, Panama needs to quickly implement the rest of the action plan so as to avoid FATF calling for greater scrutiny of transactions linked to Panama. In particular, regulations implementing the legislative changes need to be finalized in a timely fashion. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment, and indicated that—while there may be short-term costs associated with complying with international transparency requirements (FATF action plan)—the long–term (net) benefits of having a financial sector grounded in transparency are significant.
