Progress has been made in enhancing the governance of public enterprises, but they remain broadly inefficient. Staff welcomes the improved financial reporting, enforcement of the Public Enterprise Act, and progress made in merging and privatization efforts. Nonetheless, given their responsibilities to implement social policies, the poorly managed public enterprises are far from operating on a commercial basis and are mostly making losses despite receiving large government subsidies. The situation of the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC) is particularly worrisome as fuel grants by development partners are to be phased out by end-2014, which would add to fiscal burdens in subsidizing this corporation and make Tuvalu increasingly susceptible to fluctuating oil prices in the global market. A recent review conducted by a third party suggests that tariff adjustments may be inevitable to make the TEC financially viable. A reform plan is needed to put public enterprises on a sustainable footing . The reform package should aim to enhance the enterprisesâ€™ commercial orientation and financial soundness. In particular, there is a need to clearly define and cost their social responsibilities, which, together with strengthened accounting and auditing practices, would enhance their transparency and accountability. With respect to the TEC, electricity tariff rates should be reviewed periodically and allowed to adjust to appropriately reflect operational cost and fuel price movements, and government social policies should be directed at protecting the most affected poor. The authorities are committed to advancing public enterprise reform with assistance by development partners. They are working with the Asian Development Bank on public enterprise reform through privatization and merging, and are seeking additional technical assistance in reviewing the operation of the Telecommunication Corporation.
