Paraguay’s economy combines sound macroeconomic fundamentals with persistent developmental challenges . Government debt stands at a moderate 18 percent of GDP, inflation is well contained, and international reserves are ample. Output growth picked up significantly over the past decade, amid a boom in agricultural commodity prices that boosted the country’s soy, grains, and beef industries. Nonetheless, Paraguay’s per capita income continues to lag well behind regional comparators, reflecting deficient infrastructure, poor educational outcomes, and a business environment marked by weak law enforcement and high informality (Figure 1). Inequality and poverty rates have come down markedly in recent years, but remain elevated. The government is pursuing an ambitious reform agenda to address some of these challenges Upon assuming office in August 2013, the administration of President Cartes launched a series of initiatives, including a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) and a strategy for increasing infrastructure investment. The authorities remain committed to creating a more diversified, investor-friendly, and inclusive economy, though weak institutional capacity has constrained implementation in certain areas. The government has also been facing resistance to some of its plans from Congress, including during the 2015 budget round. Country-wide municipal elections are scheduled for November.
