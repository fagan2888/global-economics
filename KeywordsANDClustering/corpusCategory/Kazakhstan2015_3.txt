Policy discussions centered on the near-term policy response needed to revive the economy and the progress in strengthening policy frameworks. Regarding the short run, staffâ€™s assessment is that (i) the fiscal stimulus is justified on countercyclical grounds, provided credible medium-term consolidation measures are identified; (ii) the tight monetary policy stance, which helped reduce pressure on the exchange rate, may need to be loosened in view of rapidly falling inflationary pressures; (iii) further steps are needed to lower NPLs and bolster financial sector Page 18 resilience; and (iv) more rapid implementation of structural reforms is needed. As for the longer run, staff highlighted the imperative of further bolstering the macroeconomic policy architecture to help the economy absorb current and future shocks and to ensure durable growth and shared prosperity. The authorities agreed with the staff on the proposed short-term policy response and broadly shared the view on the need to enhance macroeconomic policy frameworks.
