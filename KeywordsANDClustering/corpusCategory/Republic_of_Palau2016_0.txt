Palau is a middle-income micro state in the Pacific that relies heavily on tourism and grants, and is exposed to natural disasters and climate change. The country was hit by a severe drought early this year associated with El Niño weather conditions, which led the authorities to ration water consumption and declare state of emergency in March and April (Appendix I). Palau’s political system is based on the U.S. model, the presidential term is four-year, and the next elections are in November 2016. President Remengesau Jr. is well regarded for his environmental initiatives such as the world's first shark sanctuary created in 2009 and the world’s largest marine sanctuary created in 2015 (Appendix II). Palau’s legal tender is the U.S. dollar and its fiscal year ends in September. Palau became independent in 1994 after being under U.S. administration. As part of a 50-year Compact of Free Association, the United States provided US$580 million in financial aid to Palau during 1994-2009 for infrastructure investment, budget support, and the establishment of a Compact Trust Fund (CTF). The CTF, with an initial investment of US$70 million, was to provide Palau with US$5 million in FY1999–09 and US$15 million in FY2010–44. But the CTF funds proved insufficient and a new agreement extending financial assistance for another 15 years was signed in 2010. The new assistance included US$30 million for the CTF, US$122 million in current grants, and US$67 million for infrastructure. However, the agreement has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress, although Palau continues to receive current grants and CTF withdrawals. The projections below assume that the agreement is ratified in FY2017, with the funds evenly disbursed during FY2018–24. Palau would face a drop in government revenue after FY2024 when the Compact grants expire, but it would continue to receive US$15 million in CTF withdrawals until the CTF is exhausted. Palau’s economic policies in FY2014-15 were broadly in line with past IMF advice (Appendix III). The fiscal position has improved thanks to spending restraint, and a tax reform bill was sent to Congress in FY2014, which is pending approval. Basic infrastructure and internet connectivity are being upgraded through ongoing projects. Efforts to expand financial supervision to the National Development Bank of Palau and other non-bank financial institutions are also underway.
