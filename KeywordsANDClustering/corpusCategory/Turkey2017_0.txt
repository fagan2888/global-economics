Turkey has a dynamic economy, but needs to invigorate growth. Since the 2001 financial crisis, strengthened macroeconomic policies have dramatically improved socio-economic outcomes. Over the period, real per capita income increased by 50 percent, the incidence of poverty was more than halved, and life expectancy increased by 5 years. Enrolment and graduation rates increased significantly at all education levels, while gender gaps narrowed. The transformation into an industrial and service economy is ongoing, with agriculture still accounting for over one fifth of total employment. However, Turkey’s catch-up with advanced Turkey: Per Capita GDP in 2010 PPP U.S. Dollars Relative to the United States (Percent) economies has slowed since 2008, and progress has increasingly diverged from the historic record of best performers. Moreover, growth has been unbalanced, as it has been accompanied by rising private sector and external indebtedness, leading to increased private balance-sheet stress. Source: WEO. Notes: Data for Korea are 5-year centered averages. Data for other countries are for 2000–15, shifted back in time to comparable level of development of Korea. E.g., Turkey income relative to the US in 2000 (27 percent of US per capita GDP) was similar to that of Korea in 1987. Political and economic uncertainty have increased following the failed coup attempt in July 2016. Since then, a state of emergency has been imposed. More than 140,000 public employees, including one fifth of all judges and prosecutors and over one third of the staff of the banking supervisory agency (BRSA) and some economic ministries, have been suspended or dismissed. Around 40,000 people have been detained and over 4,000 companies and institutions with assets of close to US$4 billion have been shut, or taken over by the state. A referendum that would expand presidential powers is likely in 2017.
