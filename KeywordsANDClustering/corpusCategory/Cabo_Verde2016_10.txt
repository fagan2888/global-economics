Asset quality and bank profitability remain a concern, but capital buffers appear adequate (Table 5). Despite high lending rates, profitability is depressed by low credit extension and high NPLs. Short-term commercial bank spreads dropped sharply in early 2016, but longer-term spreads increased, maintaining the average spread at 7.3 percent. NPLs which peaked at 22.3 percent in August 2014 continued to decline to 16.5 percent at end-2015, but inched up to 16.9 percent in June 2016. Capital adequacy has slightly declined to 14.8 percent in June 2016, yet provisions to NPLs remain quite strong at about 53 percent. The authorities have taken regulatory measures to facilitate the resolution of NPLs and thus encourage credit growth. In February 2015, the BCV extended the time period to liquidate repossessed assets from NPLs from 2 to 5 years. In tandem, the finance ministry has postponed tax collection to the time of sale of repossessed assets. Meanwhile, the BCV has continued its heightened supervision and is in the process of making it even more pro-active by reinforcing its supervision team and stepping up on-site audits. At the same time, it continues to encourage banks and corporates to recognize and address NPLs. However, Cabo Verde continues to lag in financial market development. Although Cabo Verde’s ranking in the WEF financial market development index has improved, it still trails the country’s institutional development. The interbank money market only recently resumed activity Page 19 after a couple of years of hiatus, suggesting that the reputational stigma attached to borrowing in the interbank market may have eased. However, a secondary market for BCV and government bills still needs to be established and activated. This would also help in preparing alternative financing options beyond concessional borrowing in the medium to longer term (see Selected Issues paper).
