Real GDP growth accelerated in 2014 to 3.8 percent and strong growth continued in 2015Q1 . Double-digit growth in investment, and strong private consumption supported by credit growth and improved labor market conditions, boosted output (Table 1, text chart). Real export growth also accelerated, mostly owing to a pick-up in automobile, chemical and plastic products. However, the contribution of net exports to growth remained negative in 2014 due to high investment-related imports. Favorable developments in exports, domestic demand and credit continued through the first quarter, but there are some incipient signs of slowdown since May (Figure 1). Deflation, mostly reflecting developments in external and administered prices, ended in April 2015 (Box 1). 2012Q12012Q42013Q32014Q22015Q1 Net exports Private consumption Public consumption Investment Real GDP growthSources: Republic of Macedonia State Statistical Office; and IMF staff calculations. FYR Macedonia: Contribution to Real GDP Growth Page 11 Box 1. Deflationary Developments and Drivers FYR Macedonia experienced deflation like several other countries in the region. Headline inflation in FYR Macedonia began to fall sharply in mid-2013 and turned negative in April 2014. The falling inflation was mostly due to falling food and energy prices and their pass-through to domestic prices. Many neighboring countries in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro and Poland, experienced deflation in 2014 (text charts). The contribution from world food and energy prices, their pass-through to domestic prices via cuts in administered prices (mostly in energy), and low euro area inflation seem to be the main drivers. Falling food and energy prices as well as low core inflation in the euro area contributed another 20 percent to price developments. Reductions in administered prices during 2012–2014 are estimated to have contributed to 60 percent of the decline in headline inflation, according to a regression-based variance decomposition analysis. Administered prices consist of about 15 percent of the consumption basket (mostly fuels and electricity). These estimates are in line with the findings in Iossifov and Podpiera (2014) for other countries in the region (text chart). Headline inflation turned positive since April 2015 and has been increasing. Deflation risks are low, despite recent downward revisions in world oil prices in the absence of any further cuts in administrative prices.

Page 12 Despite strong growth, the government’s budget deficit target was missed in 2014. At 4.2 percent of GDP, the deficit was higher than the supplementary budget target by ½ percent of GDP (¾ percent relative to the original budget). This was mostly due to underperformance in non-tax and capital revenues, a persistent trend since 2010, while spending remained within the budgeted amount (text table). The general government debt reached 38 percent of GDP at end-2014, a near doubling since 2008, while broader public sector debt (includes mainly two State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the Public Enterprise for State Roads (PESR) and the Electricity Distribution Company (ELEM)) rose to 44 percent of GDP (Figure 2, Tables 2a and 2b). Credit growth strengthened further against the backdrop of relaxed monetary conditions. Facing imported deflationary pressures, the monetary stance has been broadly accommodative, with the key policy rate unchanged at 3.25 percent and relaxation measures on certain reserve requirements in place for more than 1½ years (Figure 3). The associated decline in bank lending rates has helped revive credit growth to about 9 percent y-o-y in June 2015 from the trough reached two years ago. The steady decline in local currency to FX interest rate spreads has helped the de-euroization process of both deposits and loans (Figure 3, Box 2). Short-term external vulnerabilities have moderated. The current account strengthened further in 2014, aided by strong export growth and resilient private transfers (Figure 4, Table 3). FDI inflows held up and more than covered the current account deficit; yet external debt edged up to almost 70 percent of GDP, reflecting public sector borrowing and rising debt component in FDI. A successful Eurobond issuance in 2014 improved reserves coverage (text chart), allowing FYR Macedonia to pre-finance its 2015 external fiscal financing needs and repay the IMF earlier than scheduled. 20102011201220132014Total Revenues9592929493Tax Revenues and Contributions9997959698Taxes 1/99989296101Other Taxes11511510877 Social Contributions96949810099Non-Tax Revenues8881838473Capital Revenues6961767646Grants4729737875Expenditures9693969596Current Expenditures9794989698Capital Expenditures8784888284 Source: IMF staff calculations.Note: 1/ Include PIT, CIT, VAT, Excises, and Custom Duties.

Page 13 Box 2. Trends in De-Euroization Similar to other Balkan countries that operate a fixed exchange rate regime, euroization has traditionally been high in FYR Macedonia. This has been driven by factors typically identified in the literature: low initial credibility of institutions, volatility of inflation and income, and lower interest rates offered on foreign currency-denominated loans by foreign bank subsidiaries. In addition, large private transfers, notably from Germany, have contributed to significant deposit euroization –prompting banks to extend foreign currency-denominated loans in order to match the asset and liability structure of their own balance sheets. While price and exchange rate stability remains the primary objective of monetary policy in FYR Macedonia, fostering a continuous process of de-euroization has been an important policy goal. With a view to contain balance sheet risks of unhedged non-financial private sector agents, the monetary authorities have progressively put in place regulatory safeguards and buffers against excessive euroization since 2009. These have included: (i) differentiated reserve requirements for LC and FX liabilities; (ii) a cap on the daily net open FX position of banks to 30 percent of their own funds; and (iii) requirements from banks to identify and document the situation of large unhedged FX borrowers. More recently, the central bank continued to balance the needs for monetary stimulus with the objective of maintaining a significant spread between the central bank bill and ECB main policy rates, in order to incentivize the banks to offer a substantial currency deposit/loan spread. These policies have borne fruit, bringing down loan and deposit euroization levels, particularly for the non-financial private sector (text charts). In the context of declining LC and FX lending rates but of a slower decline in the currency spreads, the proportion of foreign currency-denominated loans has fallen below 45 percent of total loans at end-2014 compared to 53.5 percent in January 2009. The proportion of foreign currency-denominated deposits has fallen to below 42 percent of total deposits from the peak of about 59 percent observed during the 2009 financial crisis, driven by both corporates and households.
