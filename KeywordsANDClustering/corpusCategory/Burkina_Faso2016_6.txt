The quality of national statistics is adequate for surveillance purposes, but there is a lack of high-frequency indicators to monitor economic activity. Staff noted in particular that monthly trade data and quarterly financial stability indicators could be made available with shorter lags. The authorities are producing quarterly GDP estimates but these are subject to frequent and significant revisions. Most importantly, staff regretted the further delays in adopting a new base year for the annual national accounts, given that the current base year (1999) and related sector weights do not reflect the current structure of the economy. Staff welcomed the completion of the informal sector survey, but emphasized that it would be important to start the survey on the informal gold sector before the end of the year (new SB) to ensure that its findings could inform the rebasing exercise, which is expected to be completed by 2018, with 2015 as the new base year (MEFP Â¶46).
