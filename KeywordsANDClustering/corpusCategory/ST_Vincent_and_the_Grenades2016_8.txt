Data provision is broadly adequate for key areas of surveillance, but needs improvements. Limited availability of labor market indicators is being addressed by the Labor Survey expected by end-2016. BoP statistics, undergoing revisions based on BPM6 and improved surveys and including IIP statistics, are expected by end-2016. The authorities are also improving fiscal statistics with the new chart of accounts, compliant with GFS 2014, in place since the 2016 budget was approved. Moreover, statistical coverage of the operations of state-owned enterprises is weak, given their non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. The authorities should aim to have more timely and updated information by end-2016. The 2016 updated safeguards assessment found that the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) continues to maintain a governance framework that provides for independent oversight. Transparency in financial reporting has been maintained and the external audit mechanism is sound. However, the internal audit function only partially conforms to international standards, with steps underway to address this weakness.
