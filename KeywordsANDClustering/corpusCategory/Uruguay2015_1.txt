During 2015, economic activity in Uruguay markedly slowed, triggered by a regional downturn and weakening prices of its export commodities. Growth is estimated to have decelerated to 1.5 percent in 2015, the lowest level since the 2002 crisis, due to a cooling off in investment (including the completion of a large pulp mill) and private consumption from recent highs. The second quarter saw a small contraction in real activity (on a y/y basis) for the first time since 2003, followed by a moderate rebound in the third quarter.

Page 11 decline was driven mostly by a large, albeit transient, drop in electricity production due to drought, there is also evidence of a more persistent slowdown, with a decline in consumer and business confidence, and weaker credit growth for both firms and households. The latter seems to be due to lower demand for credit rather than to supply constraints. Unemployment rose during 2015, to 7.9 percent in November. The current account deficit is estimated to have fallen to 3¾ percent of GDP in 2015 as the lower oil import bill and higher pulp exports from the new pulp mill offset the effects of lower agricultural export prices and weak demand from key trading partners Argentina and Brazil. Despite the cooling economy, inflation remains entrenched above the central bank’s 3–7 percent target range . Defying the closing output gap, a relatively tight monetary stance over the past two years, and low international food and energy prices, headline inflation has edged up to more than 9 percent (y/y) since July, while core inflation (excluding food and administered prices) has exceeded 10 percent (y/y) since June. Significant depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar has contributed to inflationary pressures. The pass-through of low international fuel prices has been limited, in an effort to improve the financial health of the state-owned oil distribution company, ANCAP. -8-6-4-20246810-8-6-4-202468102007-142015 (est.)

Page 13 Box 1. The Drivers of Inflation in Uruguay Against a history of chronic high inflation from the 1960s to the early 1990s, inflation has been reduced to single-digit levels since 2004. However, inflation has remained stubbornly above the official inflation target range. Earlier (2013) staff estimates of the Phillips curve showed that the inflation process in Uruguay was driven by both past and expected inflation The findings also indicated that inflation expectations (which in recent months have drifted up to 9.35 percent at a one-year horizon) are influenced by actual inflation. The output gap and labor costs were also found to influence inflation. Most collective wage agreements include clauses stipulating ex-post corrections for the deviation of actual from expected inflation. Such wage indexation can help explain why lagged inflation remains a particularly important driver of inflation. A decomposition of inflation dynamics (measured as deviations from the mid-point of the inflation target range) also points to the role of the recent depreciation and the delayed impact of monetary tightening The decomposition in terms of structural shocks that drive inflation, shows that exchange rate depreciation has contributed to excess inflation since early 2014. It also highlights that—although monetary policy has become tighter following the adoption of money targeting in July 2013—the earlier more relaxed monetary stance still contributes to excess inflation, as a result of the strong inflation inertia.

After depreciating through 2014, the peso has weakened further against the U.S. dollar in 2015 (22 percent since the start of the year), broadly in line with the regional and global trend among emerging markets. As the surge in nonresident purchases of local government securities had abated, in April 2015 the authorities eliminated the only remaining capital flow management measure—the 30 percent reserve requirement on nonresident purchases of central bank securities. Pressures on the peso intensified during July through October, with portfolio outflows on both the asset and the liability side, as domestic pension funds purchased Uruguayan securities from non-residents and increased their foreign-currency assets (closing in on their regulatory exposure limit). In particular, domestic investors (including pension funds) purchased around 20 percent of the successful issuance of a US$1.7 billion external government bond in October. In addition, domestic deposit dollarization picked up during 2015, rising from 77 percent to more than 81 percent of total deposits, although more than half of the increase was driven by valuation effects rather than a portfolio shift. Preliminary indications are that these pressures abated in November. FDI inflows have slowed down a notch in recent quarters but continued to fully finance the current account deficit. Extensive central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market since July has contained the pace of depreciation of the peso, lowering reserves. Gross international reserves have dropped by US$ 2.6 billion since June, despite the issuance of the aforementioned external government bond. The central bank (BCU) has sold U.S. dollars in the spot and forward markets to support the peso and, in October, bought back peso securities amounting to US$650 million, mostly from domestic pension funds, in exchange for foreign currency (accommodating these funds’ transactions mentioned above). The interventions to support the peso declined sharply in November. At 29 percent of GDP (14½ months of imports), end-2015 reserves remained comfortably above the upper bound of the IMF reserve adequacy metric, and various other prudential benchmarks. Furthermore, the BCU and commercial banks’ foreign assets taken together are sufficient to cover total foreign currency denominated bank deposits. The real effective exchange rate (REER) is estimated to remain in line with fundamentals: analysis based on the EBA current account model suggests a 1 percent undervaluation of the REER, while staff estimates using the external stability approach point to a 5 percent overvaluation. (Annex I). The associated increase in banks’ deposits abroad, as they offset the increase in their U.S. dollar liabilities, is recorded in the balance of payments under ‘other capital flows’.

Public Sector Primary Balance and Fiscal Impulse (In percent of GDP) Fiscal impulse 2/ Structural Primary Balance Primary Balance The fiscal policy stance has been procyclical in 2015. Estimations Page 17 The monetary policy stance has tightened over the last two years . The introduction of operational targets for base-money growth, in mid-2013, coincided with an overall tightening of financial conditions, with real money growth slowing and real interest rates picking up. After several quarters during which base money growth undershot its target range, the central bank lowered the range from 8–10 to 7–9 percent on December 30, 2014. M1+ growth has slowed further since then (even though the recent foreign exchange interventions have been mostly sterilized), with a coinciding decline in the demand for base money as a result of the economic slowdown and the pickup in deposit dollarization. With one-month interest rates at about 15 percent, the monetary policy stance is in line with what a Taylor rule would suggest (Figure 3). The medium-term budget for the new government’s 5-year term projects a tightening of the primary fiscal deficit by 1½ percent of GDP over 5 years (Box 2) For 2015, the primary balance is estimated at close to zero, aligned with the budget, as lower tax revenues were offset by a sharper reduction in public investment. The overall fiscal deficit in 2015 is estimated at 3.6 percent of GDP, 0.3 higher than in the budget, because of higher interest payments. Staff forecasts a reduction in the overall deficit from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent by 2019, which is in line with the budget, albeit with lower interest costs than in the budget (owing to the recent reduction in costly central bank debt) and a correspondingly smaller improvement in the primary balance, by 1 percent of GDP by 2019. Based on these assumptions, the impact of the fiscal consolidation on the path of net public sector debt would be less than foreseen in the budget, and would not fully stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. An important deviation from earlier practices is that the nominal spending levels in the budget have been stipulated for only the next two years. In 2017, the government will assess appropriate spending levels for the period 2018–19, based on the evolution of external and domestic economic developments, and allowing for adjustments as needed to meet the 5-year targets. The simultaneous reduction in both the BCU’s assets and debt (along with some other liability management operations) promises a reduction in net public sector interest payments of around 0.5 percent of GDP per year. However by selling reserves, the BCU also foregoes the expected valuation gains on these reserves that would result from the depreciation of the peso. Indeed, the expected depreciation (driven by the persistent inflation differential) is a major determinant of the high carry cost of reserves. Staff estimates that the forgone valuation gains would offset about 40 percent of the improvement in net debt dynamics that results from the reduction in net interest payments. 2004Q12005Q22006Q32007Q42009Q12010Q22011Q32012Q42014Q12015Q2 Financial Conditions Index Sovereign spread REER Real lending rate Real money growth (M1 plus) Real credit growth FCI GDP growth (q/q, in percent, right scale) L oo Source: IMF staff estimates.Note: The financial conditionindex provides a summary measure of the effect of financial variables on economic activity.

T Page 18 The government has proposed new wage- setting guidelines that could moderate wage growth and alleviate the indexation of wages to past inflation (Box 3). Employers and unions are currently negotiating new multi-year wage agreements. The guidelines for the negotiations—the bulk of which is expected to be concluded by end-2016—envisage an increase in nominal wages between 6–10 percent per year, based on sectoral performance. The few sectoral agreements already signed did not fully incorporate the features of the guidelines that could moderate inflation inertia. Since the new government took office in March 2015, it has initiated important reforms. Key initiatives would aim to improve education, boost infrastructure investment with private funding, and enhance the monitoring of public enterprises. The successful and timely implementation of these and other reforms could be challenging. 20Nov-11Nov-12Nov-13Nov-14Nov-15 Nominal wage growth Real wage growth Wage Growth (Y-o-y, in percent)Sources: Haver Analytics and Fund staff calculations. Page 19 Box 2. The Government’s Budget Plans for 2015–19 The five-year budget plan presented by the government in August 2015 was approved by Parliament in December. The budget envisages a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit by 1 percent of GDP over 5 years and an improvement in the primary balance of 1.6 percent of GDP. Half of this improvement would come from a reduction in current and capital expenditures. On the revenue side, higher revenues from public enterprises would contribute to a fourth of the overall improvement. Current expenditures of the non-financial public sector are expected to remain stable as a percentage of GDP, excluding the 2014 payment to the Energy Stabilization Fund of 0.3 percent of GDP. Public wage expenditures should remain at 5 percent of GDP, which includes keeping real wages constant as well as additional spending in the areas of education, public health, and security. The budget also includes a broader initiative to boost public investment, a third of which would be financed by private funds, including through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Public sector capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP would be around 2.7 percent over the period, which corresponds to their 2011 level. On the revenue side, the budget foresees an increase in revenues by 0.6 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2019. In particular, the cumulative operating profits of public enterprises are projected to increase by $440 million over five years. Tax revenues would increase by 0.3 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2019 as a result of higher tax revenues from public enterprises, improvement in collection and payroll increases. The budget documents foresee that the above measures would raise the gross and net public debt by about 4 percentage points of GDP through 2018 before stabilizing by 2019.

The New Wage-Setting Guidelines The government’s guidelines for the ongoing sixth round of wage council negotiations propose wage increases set in nominal terms that vary by sector depending on growth performance. The proposal includes a backward-correction mechanism that would be activated if accumulated inflation after the first two years of the wage agreements exceeds the proposed nominal increases, to ensure that employees bear no real wage loss. In addition, a safeguard clause allows for an immediate adjustment of nominal wages if accumulated inflation over a 12-month period exceeds 12 percent. The new guidelines would alter the wage setting practices relative to previous rounds, which focused on wage increases set in real terms, with actual wages being adjusted for past and expected inflation. While the government’s guidelines for the previous round of negotiations offered the option of setting wage increases in nominal terms (to reduce the impact of automatic indexation of wages on inflation), only 5 out of 183 agreements used that option. Furthermore, the new proposed nominal wage increases are lower than those agreed in the previous round of negotiations (for the 5 sectors which opted for such nominal adjustments) and are differentiated by sector. In fact, the highest suggested nominal wage increase over the next three years remains below projected nominal GDP growth. In addition, the sectoral differentiation of wage increases provides a first attempt to address the heterogeneity across sectors in terms of productivity growth, and to limit competitiveness losses in exporting sectors. The guidelines recommend higher increases for the lowest wages to contain wage inequalities within each sector. The proposed guidelines would help reduce the wage inertia that has contributed to inflation persistence. Adjustments based on past inflation would be made only after two years and only to avoid real wage declines, and the trigger for the safeguard clause that could lead to adjustments within the first two years is set well above the 3–7 percent inflation target range and inflation expectations. This contrasts with the semiannual and annual adjustments for inflation included in the agreements following the previous negotiation round. ____________________ Wage agreements are typically negotiated for two or—more commonly—three years.
