(As of October 2016) Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans to Indonesia have totaled US$31.5 billion since 1969. The ADB approved a total of US$1.4 billion in loans to Indonesia in 2015. The sectors with the largest shares in cumulative lending are public sector management (18.9 percent), energy (14.4 percent), agriculture and natural resources (14.1 percent), and finance (13.4 percent). Between 1969 and 2015, the ADB provided TA grants to Indonesia amounting to US$437 million. The TA grants were financed from the ADB’s TA Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund and other sources. The ADB has completed a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2016−2019 for Indonesia, aligned with the government’s medium-term development plan for 2015−2019. The CPS is closely attuned to the needs of Indonesia as a large middle-income country and guided by the government’s commitment on development. The CPS will also maintain consistency with the priorities set out in ADB’s Mid-Term Review of Strategy 2020. ADB’s new partnership with Indonesia will be working toward inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth through improved infrastructure services, better economic governance, and enhanced human resource development.
