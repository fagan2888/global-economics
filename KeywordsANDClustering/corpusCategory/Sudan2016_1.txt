In 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, good harvests boosted economic growth and reduced inflation. However, weak commodity export prices and expansionary policies widened external imbalances, which remain an important stability risk. Non-oil real GDP grew by 5.8 percent in 2015 (up from 2.7 percent in 2014), driven by agriculture and services, while oil-GDP contracted by 10 percent. The declining trend in inflation started to reverse in recent months. Inflation slowed to 12.6 percent in December 2015 (from 26 percent at end-2014) owing largely to lower food prices, but picked up to 14.3 percent in June 2016 as nonfood inflation remained high at about 20 percent. The fiscal deficit widened by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.9 percent , as fuel subsidies remained high due to high import financing costs reflecting Sudan-specific risks, while oil 60Jan-11Nov-11Sep-12Jul-13May-14Mar-15Jan-16 Non-food Food Overall Consumer Price Index (In percent,year over year) Source:Sudanese authorities Page 14 revenues (including transfers from South Sudan) declined in line with international prices. Ongoing tax administration reforms raised tax collections slightly. In 2016, in response to continued shortfalls in oil revenues, the authorities tightened expenditure, especially capital, to contain the first quarter deficit to 0.5 percent of GDP. Net domestic assets of the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) expanded by 38 percent in 2015 largely owing to lending to the government (temporary advances and letters of guarantee) and quasi-fiscal activities (QFAs) related to losses on gold purchases and support to agriculture. Total lending to government and QFAs reached 3.8 percent of GDP in 2015, up from 1.8 percent in 2014 (Box 3). However, the growth of net domestic assets slowed to 27 percent annually in May 2016 thanks to restrained government borrowing. Transfers from South Sudan comprise transit fees for the use of Sudanese oil pipelines and payments under the Transitional Financial Arrangement to compensate Sudan for the loss of oil exports. Gold exports have become a significant source of foreign exchange for the official sector. Losses arise because the CBOS purchases gold from domestic producers in local currency at a price that reflects the parallel exchange rate, exports the gold, and sells the foreign exchange proceeds at the more appreciated official rate.

CBOS Financing of the Budget and QFAs (in percent of GDP) Page 15 The external position—structurally weakened by the loss of oil revenues following South Sudan’s secession—was hit by a negative terms-of-trade shock in 2015, compounded by expansionary policies. The current account deficit (on a cash basis) widened to 5.9 percent of GDP (from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2014), largely owing to lower prices for Sudan’s commodity- based exports (mainly livestock, gold, oil, and sesame) and high oil import-financing costs. Non- oil imports also increased significantly. In the first quarter of 2016, the trade deficit widened to 1.1 percent of GDP (from 0.7 percent in the same period of last year) on account of weak commodity exports. International reserves dropped by about $460 million in 2015 and remained low at $1.2 billion (1.4 months of imports) as of May 2016 . The CBOS intervened in the foreign exchange market and financed strategic imports such as fuel and wheat. These interventions were made possible by financial inflows from Gulf countries, estimated at $2.1 billion between May 2015 and January 2016. Following two large devaluations in 2012–13, the official exchange rate remained virtually unchanged over the past year and a half . As a result, the official rate appreciated significantly 140160Jan-11Nov-11Sep-12Jul-13May-14Mar-15Jan-16 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates (January 2011 -April 2016) REER OfficialrateREER Parallel rate Source: INS (IMF), and IMF staffcalculations.

In contrast, the parallel exchange rate depreciated by 36 percent between end-2014 and end-June 2016, which increased the parallel market premium to 125 percent (from 46 percent). Overall, staff estimates that the exchange rate is overvalued by about 50 percent in real terms (Annex I). The overall performance of the banking system, which operates under Islamic finance principles, has improved. Financial stability indicators improved in the past few years with increasing capital adequacy ratios (CAR), declining nonperforming loans, and steady profits. The net open foreign- exchange position of the banking system, at -3 percent of capital, remained within regulatory limits, and the five largest banks had a positive net open position of 7 percent in March 2016. However, equity injections into weak banks have resulted in CBOS and government fully or partially owning 15 of the 37 banks, and their restructuring has been lagging. In October 2015, following significant strengthening of its framework for Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), Sudan was removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” of countries subject to monitoring. Enforcement actions against violations of U.S. sanctions contributed to the withdrawal of CBRs and complicated bank operations. This resulted in high import financing costs and rising difficulties in international transactions, including remittances, which may result in greater reliance on cash transactions and associated AML/CFT risks (Box 3). The CBOS sets two official exchange rates: an “indicative” rate and an “official” rate (within ±4 percent) which applies to public transactions and customs valuation. The difference between the two is currently less than 2 percent. Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to set their rates within ±4 percent of the indicative rate, but in practice they trade at top end of the band. Thus, the official rate differs by more than 2 percent from the commercial banks’ rate. Since January 2014, the CBOS devalued the official rate by only 7 percent, of which 2 percent in 2015. Staff estimates that the parallel market covers about 50 percent of imports—up from 30 percent in 2013 due to changes in foreign exchange regulations in mid-2014 that allowed exporters to sell their proceeds directly to importers. Based on a weighted exchange rate between the official and the parallel markets, the effective premium is about 63 percent. q ud qu Page 17 Box 3. Withdrawal of Correspondent Bank Relations Enforcement actions against international banks in mid-2014 for violating U.S. sanctions contributed to a substantial withdrawal of foreign CBRs of Sudanese banks . In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan and other countries, and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in forfeitures and fines. In 2015, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank also faced fines for violating U.S. sanctions. Among other factors, this contributed to a substantial withdrawal of CBRs of Sudanese banks. Foreign and local entities based in Sudan reported difficulties and delays in processing foreign exchange transfers to and from Sudan. The central bank and commercial banks reported a significant reduction in the number of foreign correspondents (one large bank reported having only 15 correspondent banks in 2016 compared to 55 a year ago) or an almost complete cut-off from international transactions. According to a recent report by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure, Sudan lost almost half of its CBRs between 2012 and 2015, representing a 15 percent drop in volume. Banks had to pay higher fees and post full cash collateral; the CBOS authorized “nil value” imports financed offshore; and one bank reported plans to open branches abroad to carry out international transactions. Available data suggest a slowdown in trade since the withdrawal of foreign CBRs. Import financing (e.g., through letters of credit) by both the CBOS and commercial banks slowed in 2015. Difficulties in repatriating export proceeds reportedly weakened exports. Transfer payments, including remittances were adversely affected. Embassies and international organizations reported being affected by correspondent banks’ reluctance or outright refusal to process foreign exchange transactions, despite being exempt from sanctions. Payments to the IMF were also received with long delays. Banks and the authorities expressed concern that a shift to cash transactions would jeopardize hard-won progress on the implementation of the AML/CFT framework A persistent breakdown of CBRs would weigh on economic and social outcomes. Constraints on financing imports and repatriating export proceeds may reduce trade and foreign investment. Shortage of imported goods, including foodstuffs and energy, would increase inflation and depress consumption. Difficulties in processing international transactions will lead to continued shortages of foreign exchange, which will put pressure on the exchange rate. Constraints on transferring remittances may impact the most vulnerable. These adverse developments would contribute to further dampening economic growth, and ultimately worsen social outcomes and poverty. tt tt mm = Page 18
