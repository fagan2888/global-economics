After the balance of payments position had improved on temporary factors in 2012 the current account balance worsened rapidly in 2013, reaching a deficit of 10 percent of GDP (Figure 2, Table 2). In part the deterioration reflected slowing growth in Russia, but it was further fueled by rapid wage and directed lending growth—which boosted domestic demand—and an ongoing real appreciation of the exchange rate. A disruption of potash exports compounded the deterioration. Trade Balance of Goods (Billions of U.S. dollars) Jan-13 Source: National Bank of the Republic of Belarus. Nov-13 Jun-13 As short-term risks increased, policies became more cautious from the second half of After the summer, when the scale of the current account deterioration became gradually apparent and the demand for dollar deposits rose sharply, the authorities made several policy Page 6 changes. Specifically, wage increases were paused and the exchange rate was allowed to depreciate somewhat faster. Also, monetary policy was temporarily tightened during July–November, until the NBRB switched to direct control of credit volumes in the last quarter of the year. The latter caused a sharp squeeze in commercial credit, as directed lending continued unabated. The combined measures managed to stem deposit conversions and helped quell exchange market pressure, but they were insufficient to reduce inflation, which has persisted at around 16½ percent (Figure 3).

The trade balance improved markedly, reaching a small surplus, mainly on a sharp decline in imports. While this improvement appears to large extent a seasonal phenomenon—the trade balance tends to improve sharply in the first quarter to then gradually deteriorate during the year—the turnaround may have been particularly pronounced owing to tight external financing conditions in early 2014. Meanwhile, first quarter growth surprised on the upside (+0.5 percent y-o-y), but this was influenced by a large investment project and unlikely to be sustainable. Policies were on hold in early 2014, with the notable exception of monetary policy which is gradually being loosened. The authorities continue to pursue GDP growth (3.3 percent) and real income (3 percent) targets in 2014, but in contrast to previous years, emphasis on these objectives in policy statements has been muted.
