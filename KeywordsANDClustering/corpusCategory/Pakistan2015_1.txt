Economic activity appears robust amid mixed signals . Growth has been underpinned by expansion of large-scale manufacturing (3.9 percent y-o-y in the first quarter), construction, and the services sector. Alongside, consumer confidence continued to improve. However, exports declined by 9 percent y-o-y (in US$ terms) in Q1 FY2015/16, owing to falling cotton prices and real exchange rate appreciation, and growth of remittances eased to 4 percent y-o-y in Q1 FY2015/16 (from 18 percent in FY2014/15). Foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by a half in FY2014/15, albeit with some recovery in Q1 FY2015/16. Despite several interest rate cuts (400 bps since November 2014, see Figure 2), real private sector credit growth remained subdued at 2.2 percent y-o-y in July-September 2015. Headline inflation picked up to 2.7 percent y-o-y in November 2015 but remained near multi-year lows, driven by lower food and energy prices. Core inflation has also declined to 4.1 percent in November, still significantly above headline inflation. Officially reported unemployment has remained stable at around 6 percent over the past five years, although a large share of the economy is informal. The external position has further strengthened Despite weak export performance, the current account deficit narrowed to 1 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 and is on track for a further gradual decline this year, helped by lower oil prices and increased grant assistance from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF). Owing to SBP purchases to save the oil windfall, foreign exchange reserves reached US$15.2 billion at end-September, covering almost four months of imports. Nevertheless, export competitiveness has suffered from structural factors such as security concerns, power outages, and an unfavorable business climate, as well as from significant real exchange rate appreciation over the past two years (Box 2). Banking system soundness indicators remain adequate . Banking system profitability increased, albeit on the back of higher government borrowing which exceeds credit to the private sector. Alongside, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) increased to 18.2 percent in Q1, 2015/16 (from 15.5 percent last fiscal year). Liquidity in the banking system has remained adequate.

Sectoral Contribution to Growth Page 15 Box 2. Pakistan: External Sector Assessment The current account deficit has come down from the peak of 8 percent of GDP in FY2008 to 1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15. While the deficit is relatively small, its structure—a large trade deficit (7½ percent of GDP) financed by remittances (7 percent of GDP in FY2015) and other transfers—highlights the importance of strengthening Pakistan’s export competitiveness. Indeed, market shares for Pakistan’s exports have been either stagnant or declining. The structure of the financial account shows reliance on debt issuance rather than on FDI flows, which have significantly declined over the last decade. The net International Investment Position (IIP) has marginally declined in the last years. Following appreciation of the REER by 17 percent over the past two years, estimates from standard methodologies for exchange rate assessment, while subject to significant uncertainty, point to overvaluation of varying degrees. The Fund- wide EBA exercise suggests a modest overvaluation (just below 5 percent), finding the current account close to its norm of -0.7 percent of GDP, with a policy gap of 1.2 percent of GDP driven by more expansionary than optimal fiscal policy and still less than desirable reserve accumulation. By contrast, the REER-based EBA-lite method, explicitly accounting for factors such as remittances and aid flows, suggests a much larger overvaluation of up to 20 percent. See the accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Improving Pakistan’s Competitiveness and Business Climate.” Gross reserves have remained below the adequacy level as suggested by the ARA metric. At US$15.2 billion as of end- September, they cover 3.8 months of prospective imports, or 67 percent of the ARA metric. While gross reserves are broadly in line with projections at the outset of the program, SBP spot foreign exchange purchases in FY2013/14 and FY2014/15 have exceeded the significant windfall from commodity prices and remittances. Continued accumulation of reserves is needed to further strengthen buffers while also supporting competitiveness. Regressions used for the current account-based EBA-lite method do not produce a good fit in the case of Pakistan. Adjusting the regression parameters to improve the fit produces an estimate of overvaluation of 10 percent driven by fiscal policy. The windfall is calculated relative to remittance flows and commodity prices projected at the start of the program in September 2013.
