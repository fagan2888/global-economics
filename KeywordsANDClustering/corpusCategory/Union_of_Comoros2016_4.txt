The Bank Group concretely re-engaged in Comoros in 2010 following the resolution of the Anjouan crisis and the lifting of sanctions in February 2009 after clearance of its arrears with the Bank. A two-year Interim Country Strategy Paper (I-CSP) 2009-2010 focusing on economic and financial governance and water and sanitation was approved in April 2009. In December 2011, the Board of the AfDB approved a full Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2011–2015 based on a single pillar focusing on the energy sector in support of economic diversification. This new CSP draws on the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-2014 and spans over two ADF cycles - ADF 12 and ADF 13. In April 2016, the Bank approved a second full CSP for 2016-2020, based one single pillar: Developing basic energy and road infrastructure to support economic diversification. The current CSP is aligned on the national Strategy of growth and sustainable development (SCA2D 2015- 2019) and is financed by ADF 13 and 14 resources, corresponding to a total amount of UA 40 million, including UA 10 million from the Transition States Facility (TSF). These resources will primarily aim to finance (i) a Page 69 road project (UA 15 million), (ii) an energy investment project (UA 10 million), and (iii) a sectoral budget support –energy and road- operation (UA 15 million) whose main objective will be to support government efforts in rehabilitation of roads and energy sectors in which the country faces major challenges. Moreover, aware of the weak of institutional capacity of Comoros, the Bank approved, in November 2015, the second Phase of the Project of Institutional capacity building (PRIC 2) to strengthen the operationalization of Tax department (AGID), improve the capacity of programming and management of public investment (CGP), and improve the effectiveness of the department in charge of energy (DGME). As of October 2016, the Bank’s ongoing portfolio in resources amounts to UA 22.005 million comprising 4 operations: (i) Energy Sector Support Project (ii) Energy Production, Transport & Distribution Plan, (iii) Private Sector Support Project, and (iv) the Institutional Capacities Building (PRCI 2). A Midterm review of CSP combined to Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) is planned in 2018.
