Mexico continues to navigate a complex external environment. The exchange rate has been affected by heightened risks of a rise in protectionism in major trading partners. In the context of elevated external risks, policies in Mexico remain focused on maintaining strong fundamentals and financial stability. The flexible exchange rate continues to play a key role in facilitating adjustment to external shocks. The authorities remain committed to a gradual reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). Financial and non-financial companiesâ€™ sector balance sheets are resilient to downside risks, in part due to strong financial sector supervision and regulation.
