Having bounced back quickly from the global crisis, growth has moderated below trend and macro vulnerabilities, mainly from the weak fiscal position, are rising. After falling modestly in 2009, real GDP surged in 2010–12. Since then, however, growth has remained below potential, with the latter also declining. Hence, structural impediments must be removed to maintain sustained rates of economic expansion. The counter-cyclical budgetary stimulus imparted in 2009 pushed the deficit above 5 percent of GDP in 2010 (mainly through a rise in wages and transfers). The deficit has crept up further to 6 percent since then, placing the public-debt-to-GDP ratio on an unsustainable upward trajectory and fast approaching levels associated with higher risks of disorderly adjustment in emerging economies. Continuing fast expansion of dollar-denominated credit, facilitated by a stable XR, exacerbates vulnerabilities in the financial sector, rendering further improvements in regulation and supervision even more important. Policy actions have been broadly consistent with past Fund advice. The authorities submitted to Congress a fiscal reform package that is in line with staff advice, though its approval will require cooperation of opposition parties (¶22) Other measures consistent with past Fund advice include: (i) the removal of the XR band in early 2015 and continued reserve accumulation (¶5), (ii) the reduction in the inflation target range in 2016 to 2–4 percent, in line with the average inflation of trading partners (¶4), and (iii) tightening of prudential requirements to discourage dollarization (¶28). The large easing of monetary policy was an appropriate response to the unexpectedly sharp decline in headline and core inflation amid low international oil prices (¶4). Additional progress is needed to implement the 2008 FSAP recommendations (¶29).
