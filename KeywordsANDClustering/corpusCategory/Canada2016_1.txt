After almost two years, the effects of the oil price shock continue to reverberate through the Canadian economy (Figures 1â€“2). Oil prices have fallen by 60 percent since 2014, with the spot WTI touching a low of US$27 in January 2016. At these prices, the oil sands industry is struggling to break even. With oil and gas accounting for a large share of economic and financial activity, the effects of the oil price decline have spread through the economy, transmitted through macro-financial linkages (Box 1). The economy slipped into recession in the first half of 2015, as oil companies slashed investment spending, and the stock market fell by 17 percent. In a pro-active move to insure against falling prices and slowing growth, the Bank of Canada (BOC) cut the policy rate twice in 2015. The economy recovered in the second half of 2015 and is likely to gain strength in 2016, but the complex adjustment to lower oil prices continue to weigh on the near-term outlook. A new government, led by Prime Minister Trudeau, took office in late 2015. It announced its first Budget in March 2016, emphasizing infrastructure investment and strengthening the middle class as central to growing the economy.
