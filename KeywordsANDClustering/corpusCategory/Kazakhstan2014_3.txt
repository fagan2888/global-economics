Policy discussions centered on the short-term policy stance—including restoring confidence and stability—and on progress in improving policy frameworks. In the short run, staff’s assessment is that slower growth in 2014 warrants the authorities’ somewhat looser-than-originally-planned fiscal stance. Monetary policy, on the other hand, may need to be tightened should inflationary expectations become unanchored. At the same time, to further enhance the policy architecture, staff has underscored the need for (i) a decisive follow-through on dealing with the NPL problem; (ii) strengthened monetary policy framework and gradual transition to greater exchange rate flexibility; (iii) improved medium-term planning of fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities; and (iv) a transparent and market-based reform and diversification strategy to help promote more inclusive growth. The authorities agreed with staff on the proposed short-term policy mix and broadly shared staff’s view on the need to bolster the macroeconomic policy frameworks. Page 12
