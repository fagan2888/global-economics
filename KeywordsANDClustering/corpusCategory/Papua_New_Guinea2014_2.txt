Overview. The economic transition underway calls for an adjustment of macroeconomic policies to ensure stability. Fiscal consolidation will need to be anchored by governmentâ€™s existing debt targets, with more focus on improving the quality of expenditure. Greater exchange rate flexibility will be required to cushion the economy from shocks, while more complete withdrawal of banking system excess liquidity would help strengthen monetary policy transmission and also alleviate the downward pressure on the kina. These policies should be supported by faster and deeper structural reforms to create an environment that is conducive for private sector investment, job creation, and inclusive growth.
