Economic activity picked up somewhat towards the end of 2014 and early this year (Figure 1). The pickup was propelled by very stimulative macroeconomic policies: in particular, fiscal policy has turned highly expansionary in 2014 and this year, with a strong acceleration of infrastructure spending in the last quarter of 2014 (Figure 2). On the monetary side, Central Bank has kept the policy rate at 3 percent (well below its neutral level, estimated by staff at 4½–5 percent) after reducing it by 200 basis points between September 2013 and November 2014. Lower gasoline prices sustained private consumption, while the weaker peso supported non-mining exports, in particular agriculture and forestry products (the real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 15 percent in 2014 relative to early 2013). However, recent indicators suggest that the economic recovery has lost momentum in the last few months . After improving in the first quarter of 2015, business confidence deteriorated again in the second quarter. Imports of capital goods have continued to decline on a year-on-year basis. Non-mining export growth has slowed, although partly because of one-off factors. Labor market conditions have been softening, with slower growth in private sector employment and nominal wages since early 2015. After remaining relatively low at about 6 percent in the last six months, the unemployment rate increased to 6.6 percent in May 2015, as labor force participation inched up. Inflation has remained stubbornly high. Headline inflation has exceeded the central bank’s target band (2– 4 percent) for 15 consecutive months (Figure 3). After peaking at 5.7 percent in October 2014, inflation has declined steadily as the pass-through from the sharp peso depreciation of 2014 dissipated, and has hovered around 4 percent in the last few months. In the non-tradable (service) sector, disinflation has been slower, reflecting the sustained growth of nominal wages (in turn largely explained by the high degree of wage indexation to the CPI). Nonetheless, inflation expectations at the 24-month horizon have remained well anchored at 3 percent. The external position has improved significantly. The current account deficit fell by over two percentage points of GDP in one year, from 3.7 percent in 2013 to 1.2 percent in 2014, mainly driven by the strong contraction in investment-related imports (Figure 4). EBA-based estimates suggest that the currency was modestly undervalued in 2014 in real effective terms.

Page 13 REER has appreciated somewhat in 2015 (its average in January–May 2015 was about 2½ percent above the 2014 average), the peso may be now closer to its equilibrium value (Annex I). The financial sector appears generally healthy, although recent developments in Chile’s non-banking sector warrant close attention (Figure 5). Banks’ profitability remained strong in 2014, although it has declined so far in 2015 mainly due to a smaller positive impact of inflation. Banks’ non-performing loans have decreased slightly from already low levels, and capital ratios are above regulatory thresholds. On the other hand, life insurance companies and pension funds continue to be pressured by the low-yield environment and have kept on restructuring their portfolios towards riskier or less liquid assets, notably, real estate, lower rating domestic and foreign corporate bonds (life insurance companies) and foreign mutual funds and equity (pension funds). Mutual funds grew by almost 40 percent in 2015 compared to end-2013, with the fastest growth observed in mutual funds investing in medium- and long-term fixed-income instruments. Non-financial corporate and household debt continues to increase. The debt-to-GDP ratio of Chilean non-financial firms was about 100 percent at end-2014, a relatively high level compared to other emerging economies (Box 2). Household debt-to-disposable income also rose to about 60 percent in 2014, driven by higher mortgage debt (Figure 6). Mortgage credit has grown at a much faster rate than consumer and commercial credit, with households bringing forward their home purchasing over the last few quarters in anticipation of the scheduled increase in VAT on housing from 2016. Despite higher debt, household debt service-to-income ratios have remained at low level due to low interest rates. Gov. Bonds Real Estate Instr. Real Estate Inv. Inv.

Page 14 Box 2. Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities A significant part of the increase in corporate debt-to-GDP ratio reflects Chilean firms’ increasing reliance on foreign currency funding . Foreign currency funding associated with FDI and external bond issuances accounted for about 90 percent of the increase in the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014 relative to 2013. At the end of 2014, 52 percent of corporate debt was in foreign currency, compared to 40 percent as of 2010. Given the sharp depreciation of the peso, this increase also reflects valuation effects on the existing stock, rather than “new” debt. Based on staff estimates, roughly half of the increase in the external corporate debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014 can be attributed to valuation effects caused by the depreciation of the peso. While Chilean companies appear to have increasingly relied on FDI and bond issuances, higher debt ratios for non-listed companies also reflect an increased reliance on domestic bank loans. While on average the leverage of Chilean non-financial firms has remained stable over the past two years, the share of firms with relatively high leverage has increased. Leverage (debt-to-equity) for the firms in the top 25 percent of the distribution has moved up over the past few years. On a sectoral basis, the increase in leverage in 2014 was concentrated in retail, forestry, and energy, with a few large firms in these sectors financing their expansion plans abroad. Over the last decade, the increase in leverage appears more broad-based, and leverage for Chilean listed non-financial companies is relatively high compared to other economies in Latin America. Risks to financial stability are moderated by a series of mitigating factors. Rollover risks on domestically issued corporate bonds seem moderate, as the average time to maturity of outstanding issues has increased since 2011 (from 10 to 14 years). Also, the increased reliance on foreign currency funding does not seem to be associated with greater currency mismatches. Data for the 20 largest Chilean corporations as of end 2014 show that, on average, their net foreign currency exposure was small and relatively unchanged since 2013. While a few firms have large net foreign currency liabilities, those are usually associated with significant natural hedges. Moreover, about 40 percent of this foreign currency debt is FDI- related and is typically less sensitive to external financial shocks. Finally, market perceptions of the underlying credit risk of Chilean non-financial firms have remained stable (measured by Moody’s CreditEgde+ one-year ahead expected default frequencies).

Page 15 Box 2. Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities (concluded) However, high leverage makes Chilean firms less resilient to a further slowdown of economic activity and external financial shocks. In 2014, average profitability and liquidity indicators across Chile’s non- financial firms have remained at levels close to 2013, but, as in the case of leverage, there are large differences across firms and sectors. While average profitability ticked up in 2014, the distribution had been on a downward trend since 2011. Profitability of firms in retail and construction sectors has been particularly affected, and remains much below historical averages. At the same time, the relatively greater reliance of non-listed firms on bank funding suggests that lower profitability across these firms may affect the banking sector.
