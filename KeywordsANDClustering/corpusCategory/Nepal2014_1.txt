The macroeconomic situation remains solid, but growth is low. GDP growth slowed to below 4 percent in 2012/13, largely due to a weather-related weakening in agricultural output, but the delay in passing a full budget also resulted in low capital spending and a fiscal surplus. Inflation rose to over 10 percent y/y in December 2013 in the wake of the depreciation of the Indian rupee, but moderated to 8.9 percent y/y in March 2014. Growth of remittances rose to 17½ percent in the first eight months of 2013/14, partly on account of the depreciation. This fueled further build-up of international reserves, which stood at $5.8 billion (8.1 months of prospective imports) in March. High remittance inflows also drove reserve money growth of 30½ percent y/y in March, though private sector credit growth slowed to 15½ percent y/y. Despite efforts to accelerate spending, capital expenditure remained low. The authorities have made efforts to implement IMF policy advice, but have been hampered by political uncertainty. Progress has been made toward consolidating the financial sector, and the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has begun to strengthen supervision, including with technical assistance (TA) from the IMF and donors. A full budget was passed on time for 2013/14, the treasury single account (TSA) has been rolled out to all 75 districts, and reforms in revenue administration are ongoing (with IMF TA). However, monetary policy has remained loose, and The fiscal year ends in mid-July.
