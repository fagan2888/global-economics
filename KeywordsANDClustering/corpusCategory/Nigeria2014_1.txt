Recent macroeconomic performance has been strong. Real GDP grew by 6.1 percent in Q3 2014 (y-o-y): the non-oil sector (crop production, textiles and footwear, telecommunications, and real estate) remained robust (up 7.3 percent), but the oil sector declined by 3.6 percent, mostly driven by an increase in intermediate costs. Inflation remained within the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) 6-9 percent target range, declining to 8 percent at end-2014. (Figure 5). Key banking system financial soundness indicators remain above prudential norms and CBN stress tests indicate overall resilience. This is despite slight declines in overall capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability, and a small increase in non-performing loans in the first half of 2014 (Figures 6, 7 and 8, Annex 3). Earnings have been affected by the commencement of banks’ annual payments (of 0.5 percent of total assets) into the Banking Sector Resolution Cost Fund. Banking sector performance has varied by institution-size (Figures 6 and 7), with medium and small banks underperforming larger banks, and two smaller banks requiring some recapitalization in the second half of 2014 after falling below the 10 percent minimum capital Page 7 adequacy ratio. The risk profile of banks has also evolved, with increased foreign currency exposures, both on the lending and funding sides, though the net open foreign exchange position remains small (about 6 percent of total capital) (Annex 3).

Source: CBN Page 8 Credit to the private sector grew 28½ percent in 2014, compared with 24 percent in 2013. Lending to the oil and gas, construction, and power and energy sectors have grown particularly fast, though exposures to the construction and power and energy sectors remain relatively small (at 5 percent and 4 percent of total loans respectively) (Figure 9). The spread between prime and maximum lending rates widened to 9.5 percentage points. (Figure 10). The trade surplus, $43.8 billion (or 8.4 percent of GDP) for 2013, is about 23 percent lower (2014 Q1-Q3), from lower oil exports and continued strong growth in imports. Remittances and income outflows (mostly oil profit repatriation) have been steady, with fluctuations in capital flows (including errors and omissions) driving reserve movements (Figures 11 and 12).

Page 9 The risk of debt distress remains low (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Total debt is 12.4 percent of GDP, with external debt only 1.7 percent of GDP and mostly from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) on concessional terms. However, about 30-40 percent of Federal Government (FG) domestic debt was held by non-residents at end-2013. Moreover, FG debt service on total public debt is nearly 9 percent of general government revenue, a high ratio compared to an average of 5.5 percent in developing and emerging economies. The authorities have taken bold policy actions to manage near-term vulnerabilities, but challenges remain. With oil production below the budget target of 2.38 million barrels per day (bpd) (Figure 13) and the sharp fall in the oil price (Figure 14) the 2014 FG deficit is projected to increase by 0.2 percentage points of GDP above its target of 1 percent of GDP. The Excess Crude Account (ECA) reached $2.0 billion by end-2014—well below the $6.3 billion required to cover a one-half standard deviation shock to oil receipts. The fiscal authorities responded swiftly to the oil price developments by submitting a revised 2015 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in December, with a benchmark oil price of $65 per barrel (pb) compared to the $78 pb in the original MTEF (submitted in October). The November 24-25 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) adjusted the exchange rate and tightened the monetary policy stance. The midpoint of the official retail Dutch Auction System (rDAS) rate was adjusted from N155 to N168 per U.S. dollar (a 8 percent adjustment), and the band widened from ± 3 to ± 5 percent, bringing the rDAS rate more in line with the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) rate. In parallel, to maintain market confidence, the central bank also raised the monetary policy rate (MPR) from 12 percent to 13 percent and the cash reserve requirement on private sector deposits from 15 percent to 20 percent. Initial market reaction was positive, but pressures re-emerged as oil prices fell further. Figure 13.

Gross international reserves (GIRs) stood at $34.25 billion at end-2014, a decline of $8.5 billion from end-2013 (Figure 16). After stabilizing in the middle of the year, reserves declined in the fourth quarter as the CBN intervened to support the exchange rate in the face of falling oil prices and increased capital outflows.

Exchange rate . The foreign exchange market remains segmented, with the IFEM and Bureau de Change (BDC) rates trading at premia over the rDAS rate (Figure 17), creating market distortions. Although the wedge narrowed on the November MPC decision, pressures persist and the IFEM continues to trade outside the 5 percent official band; the spread between the period average IFEM and rDAS rates reached 12 percent in January. In effective terms, the value of the naira changed by less in 2014, as the year-end adjustment offset an earlier appreciation, in line with the dollar Page 11 (Figure 18). For regional trade, movements in naira per euro (to which CFA francs are pegged) matters more.
