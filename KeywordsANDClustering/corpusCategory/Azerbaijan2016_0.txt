Oil and gas are central to Azerbaijan's economy. During the oil price boom (2006-14) hydrocarbon (HC) activity accounted for three-quarters of GDP and government income, and 90 percent of exports. Oil production is expected to decline in 2016-19, with oil prices below historical averages. A pivot toward gas extraction and the building of a new pipeline network should raise gas output and exports (from 2018 onward). Oil reserves are estimated to be 7 billion barrels, while gas reserves are 35 trillion cubic feet. The authorities are negotiating a new production sharing agreement with the consortium of foreign oil companies (AIOC), who together with the state oil company (SOCAR) extract hydrocarbons in Azerbaijan. President Aliyevâ€™s New Azerbaijani Party (YAP) dominated 2015 parliamentary elections. The main opposition parties opted not to participate. Constitutional amendments have been proposed to lengthen presidential terms from 5 to 7 years. To improve policy discussion and coordination, a high-level committee on economic policy planning and reforms was established in late 2015.
