Growth in 2013 slowed despite accommodative policies and high oil prices (Figure 1). Growth slowed to 1.3 percent in 2013 due to a contraction in investment—mainly reflecting destocking of inventories and a reduction in state-owned enterprises’ capital spending—while consumption remained robust owing to strong real wage growth and an unsecured consumer credit boom. Net exports also contributed to growth in 2013, but the share of non-oil exports in the economy continued to decline. Inflation remains above the CBR target. The slowdown appears principally structural and the output gap remained small (Selected Issues Paper). Box 1. Sanctions and Counter-Sanctions The United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, Switzerland, and other countries, have adopted sanctions against Ukrainian and Russian individuals and entities in response to the unfolding situation in Ukraine, as well as the suspension of bilateral negotiations on a variety of topics. The EU has also suspended a number of bilateral discussions and imposed travel restrictions and financial sanctions. Canada, Switzerland, and Australia have announced their own programs of financial sanctions. A number of non-EU member European countries have aligned their national policies with EU decisions. To date, the actual targets and measures taken differ across jurisdictions. For example, around 45 individuals and 20 companies have been designated for financial sanctions by the United States, while the EU named about 70 individuals and fewer than 5 companies. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it will deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions. On March 20 and March 24, Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on U.S. and Canadian government officials. Russia also passed a bill to create a national payment system insulated from foreign companies’ influence, and is considering the creation of a national rating agency. Page 7 Figure 1.

The general government balance moved from an overall surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2013, owing to weak revenues due to the economic slowdown and increased VAT refunds after the completion of large infrastructure projects. Russia continues to rely on oil revenues, as evidenced by a general government non-oil deficit of more than 12 percent of GDP. As a consequence, close to 80 percent of the oil revenues targeted for savings in the Reserve Fund (RF) were used to offset the decline in non-oil revenues and worse-than-expected privatization receipts. Hence, despite high oil prices, the RF remains well below the 7 percent targeted by the authorities. A timid and incomplete pension reform was introduced (Box 2). Box 2. Pension Reform The fiscal viability of the Russian public pension system is concerning. The main problem is a low statutory retirement age (60 for men and 55 for women) given the expected demographic dynamics and the many exemptions making the effective retirement age even lower. The reform introduced in December 2013 did not increase the statutory retirement age. Starting in 2015, contributors will earn notional pension points over their working life. The value of notional points will be assessed annually based on the system’s revenue (including government transfers to be decided annually) divided by the sum of all notional points earned by pensioners. Other changes to the system include: (i) providing financial incentives to delay retirement; (ii) increasing the contribution rate for self-employed and hazardous jobs; (iii) increasing the minimum requirement of years worked from 6 to 15, before claiming a pension; and (iv) introducing a threshold of notional points before claiming benefits. These changes will increase the effective retirement age. A person earning minimum wage would require 40 years to accumulate the minimum notional points needed to claim benefits under the system. According to the authorities, the generosity of the system – expressed as the ratio of the average benefit to the average wage – is expected to decline gradually by about 10 percentage points, from its current level of 37 percent. Under the new system, transfers from the federal government are expected to decline by about 1 percent of GDP by 2030.

The CBR had kept policy rates constant since September 2012 amid a softening of economic activity and above-target inflation (Figure 1). It also eliminated its targeted foreign exchange (FX) interventions and widened its non-intervention band while reducing the cumulative level of FX interventions necessary to move the exchange rate corridor, increasing the flexibility of the ruble. During this time, capital outflows persisted, spurred by expectations of continuing ruble depreciation. Page 9 Pressures on the ruble have intensified in early 2014. The Fed tapering talk of May 2013 did not affect Russia as much as other EMs given that Russia had not experienced large capital inflows. Nonetheless, at end–2013 and early 2014, pressures re-emerged as inflation remained relatively high, policy rate tightening fell behind other EMs, and growth prospects and fundamentals outlook deteriorated. A move to increase ruble flexibility facilitated a needed orderly depreciation before March.

Growth revisions for 2014 (between Feb 21 2013 and Feb 24 2014) Growth Revisions and Exchange Rate Depreciation In response to the exceptional circumstances, the CBR raised policy rates and reduced exchange rate flexibility from end February. The onset of geopolitical tensions raised the ruble pressure considerably and the CBR sharply increased net intervention, which reached US$26 billion for the month of March, almost matching the US$27 billion in net interventions for 2013. In a surprise move, the CBR raised its policy rates by 1½ percentage points in early March and a further ½ percentage point in April. Moreover, in response to significant currency pressures in early March, the CBR lowered the flexibility of its FX rule, increasing by more than fourfold, to US$1.5 billion, the cumulative interventions required to move the exchange rate corridor. While the CBR announced that it could determine its FX policy parameters on a daily basis, increasing discretion in its intervention policy, the shifts in the bands have so far occurred in accordance with the new rule. The discretionary policies followed by the authorities appeared to have contained the heightened currency and liquidity stress in early March. In late May, as the exchange rate traded firmly in the non-intervention zone, the CBR lowered the amount of interventions involved in each band by US$100 million to US$100 million in the inner intervention band and US$300 million in the outer intervention band.

Aug-13 Russia India Turkey Oct-13 Dec-13 Mar-14 May-14 Page 10 The banking system remains broadly stable amid a gradual slowdown of unsecured retail credit growth and a stepping-up of bank oversight . Since the 2008 crisis, the banking system has moved from a negative to a positive net foreign asset position (Figure 5). Non-performing loans have remained relatively constant throughout 2013, reaching 6.4 percent in March, and were almost fully provisioned (Table 6). Capital adequacy ratios were relatively stable and remained above the statutory minimum of 10 percent (Figure 3) while overall liquidity has edged down (Table 6). The prudential measures taken in 2013 and early 2014, including tightening risk weights and raising provisioning, have significantly reduced the growth of unsecured consumer lending and were concomitant with a decline in the banking sector profitability (Table 6). The authorities have enacted legislation to tighten regulation over predatory lending practices which should come into effect in July, intended to further reduce risks from consumer lending. W ith increased supervisory powers (¶31), the CBR has stepped up its banking supervision since the second half of 2013. This resulted in a wave of bank closures, mostly very small banks, found in breach of banking operations or money laundering laws. Some depositors have reallocated their savings from smaller to bigger banks. The extensive coverage of personal deposits by the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA), which covers 99 percent of retail deposits by number and 70 percent by value, has provided an important confidence backstop, and payouts to insured depositors have proceeded within a period of two weeks. The current account surplus shrank but capital outflows continued in 2013 . The current account surplus declined to 1½ percent of GDP in 2013 from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This reflected weaker oil and merchandise exports, as well as continuing deterioration of service and income account balances. Net private capital outflows, which had mirrored the evolution of the current account surplus, remained elevated in 2013 at about 3 percent of GDP. Outflows were driven by the nonbank private sector via shadow capital flight and net portfolio outflows. The authorities are considering measures to promote “de-offshorization,” i.e. to discourage Russian individuals and companies from using foreign corporate structures to conceal beneficial ownership or obtain undue tax advantages, which could reduce net capital outflows and increase government revenues. In May, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus signed a treaty on the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union to become effective starting 2015. Russia’s external position in 2013 was weaker than its medium-term fundamentals (Annex II). While the REER gap identified for 2013 narrowed and perhaps closed following the recent depreciation, a lasting improvement in the current account would require sustained consolidation on the fiscal policy front and structural reforms to improve competitiveness. Foreign reserves are adequate, standing at the end of April 2014 at US$472 billion or 143 percent of the IMF’s calculated reserve adequacy metric, near the upper bound of the recommended range of 100–150 percent. External debt edged up due to a major acquisition in the oil sector but remains sustainable under the baseline scenario (Tables 8–11, Figure 5 and 9). See the IMF Policy Paper “Assessing Reserve Adequacy” (2011). Page 11 Net private capital outflows increased significantly in the first quarter of 2014 to US$51 billion (Figure 2 and Box 3). Reserves at the CBR experienced additional downward pressures following the sharp increase in FX intervention in early March. The increased level of FX swaps and correspondent accounts between the CBR and domestic banks has temporarily cushioned the level of reserves, which have not declined by the total amount of interventions. While FX swaps were used to access CBR liquidity, the increase in the level of correspondent accounts at the CBR has reflected increased foreign assets repatriation by domestic banks amidst increasing geopolitical uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions are negatively weighing on the cost and access to financing. Since March, sovereign and private issuances have declined very sharply, with borrowing rates increasing by an average of 100–150 basis points (Figure 2). The government has also cancelled a number of domestic auctions. Moody’s and Fitch revised the outlook on Russia’s sovereign BBB rating from stable to negative while S&P downgraded the sovereign rating by one notch to BBB-, its lowest investment grade category. This downgrade forced similar ratings cut on major Russian corporations such as Gazprom, Rosneft, and VTB bank, as well as subsidiaries of international banks. The geopolitical uncertainty has also given rise to dollarization pressures. Page 12 Figure 2.
