The fiscal position continues to improve . For the first time in a decade, Grenada achieved a primary surplus in 2015 (2.2 percent of GDP), a significant turnaround from the deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2013. The primary balance exceeded the adjusted Quantitative Performance Criterion (QPC) by a significant margin (0.7 percent of GDP) due to continued expenditure restraint and higher-than-projected revenues. Stronger growth and a bigger yield from tax measures helped boost revenues. All end-2015 and continuous QPCs were met. This over performance was achieved even as the authorities utilized some of the fiscal space provided by the strong revenue growth to raise capital spending (allowed under the program) to support growth. Grenada entered the final year of its program with over 80 percent of the total programmed consolidation completed. All budget expenditure arrears were cleared by end This was an important condition under the program and should help restore liquidity and confidence in the economy.

Grenada: Fiscal Program Performance (in millions of EC$)2015 Page 15 (excluding membership arrears). Apart from external debt still under negotiation, no new arrears were accumulated, in line with the QPC. Remaining external arrears are primarily to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors and holdouts from the 2005 debt restructuring. The new instrument issued for the restructured U.S. dollar 2025 bonds included an allowance for participation by these 2005 holdouts. The restructuring for these creditors will be finalized in the first half of While budget expenditure arrears at end-2015 were cleared, the ceiling for end- June 2015 was not observed. During restructuring negotiations with the NIS in late 2015, the government became aware of previously unrecorded contribution arrears amounting to EC$14.5 The majority of creditors have not come forward; the excess allowance of new debt issued for these holdouts will be cancelled before the first coupon payment (May 2016) on the U.S. dollar 2030 bond. The authorities are also exploring the option of cancelling the entire allowance and pursuing a cash settlement with these creditors. & nn ili ili dg ili cc ili ili W ill hn W nn Page 16 million, or 0.6 percent of GDP. These arrears were folded into the restructuring, enabling the government to meet the December 2015 QPC. However, given the higher stock of budget expenditure arrears that would have existed in June had the additional contribution arrears to the NIS been known, the program ceiling on budget expenditure arrears for end-June 2015 would not have been observed by a small margin (EC$10.5 million, or 0.4 percent of 2015 GDP). Staff recommends granting a waiver for this deviation because it was minor and because the government accomplished the program objective of clearing all arrears by end-2015. The assessment of performance under other previous test dates was unaffected because central government expenditure arrears remained below the program ceilings, despite the higher stock. The authorities continue to limit external borrowing as per the QPC. In 2015, external non-concessional borrowing was restricted to the bonds issued to execute the restructuring agreement with private external bond creditors. The remaining external borrowing consists primarily of exceptional financing from multilateral creditors, excluded from the QPC on non- concessional external debt (TMU¶10, see also ¶29). The continuous QPC was consequently met, as was the end-2015 indicative target on the net change in central government and central government guaranteed debt. External borrowing is expected to remain limited going forward, with borrowing limited to program and project based lending from the World Bank and Caribbean Development Bank consistent with the authorities’ development strategy (¶31). Spending under the ‘Support for Education, Employment and Development’ (SEED) program was below the indicative target (floor) for end-2015 . Staff had understood that the new beneficiary information system developed under Grenada’s World Bank-supported program would be fully operational in late 2015, but the transition has taken longer than expected due to technical and administrative capacity constraints. Consequently, the approval of new beneficiaries has been constrained, and spending under the target fell short by EC$1.6 million, or 0.06 percent of GDP. The SEED program is now closed to new entrants until the transition is complete, expected in the first half of 2016. The goal of SEED reform under the World Bank The additional arrears comprised: (i) arrears that existed prior to the program period (EC$10.9 million) from an earlier agreement signed between the NIS and the Government of Grenada on pre-2002 contribution arrears; and (ii) arrears that arose over the program period as a result of discrepancies (related to both bookkeeping and disagreements as to amounts owed) between the NIS and Government of Grenada data on contributions owed il il mm dg Y mm PP q z ili ¶ Page 17 program ―to improve the targeting of social spending and eventually consolidate all social programs under the strengthened SEED program―is an important objective which the Fund- supported program shares. As a result, staff continues to support the existing definition of the indicative target. In the interim, the government has continued to offset the impact of under-spending on SEED with higher spending on other social programs such as the youth apprenticeship, needy assistance, and emergency recovery programs.
