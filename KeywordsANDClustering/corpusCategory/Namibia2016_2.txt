Namibiaâ€™s key challenges are to preserve macroeconomic stability and make inroads in reducing high unemployment and income inequality. With recent expansionary fiscal policy contributing to rising public debt and external vulnerabilities, discussions focused on the need for: (i) anchoring additional fiscal adjustment in a credible medium-term plan that minimizes the negative impact on growth; (ii) managing risks from overvalued housing prices and the large non-bank financial sector; and (iii) advancing structural reforms to generate sufficient jobs to reduce unemployment and inequality.
