Growth has remained strong and inflation moderate. Real GDP grew by 7 percent in 2015, with activity particularly buoyant in the construction, communication, finance, and transportation sectors. Inflation remained in single digits throughout 2015, averaging 5.6 percent, despite the significant exchange rate depreciation in the first half of 2015. Inflation in April 2016 was 5.1 percent, close to the authorities’ target of 5 percent. Source: National Bureau of Statistics. Exchange Rates The external position recorded mixed developments. The current account deficit declined from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to a projected 8.6 percent in 2015/16, mainly due to lower oil prices. The capital and financial account surpluses, however, have narrowed, reflecting lower donor support and lower FDI related to natural gas exploration. International reserve coverage has declined somewhat to a projected 3.6 months of imports of goods and services in June 2016, reflecting no accumulation in 2015/16 and the projected large increase in imports in 2016/17. The shilling depreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar in 2014/15 (about 25 percent) and experienced high volatility. While the shilling depreciated a bit further since mid-2015, the situation in the foreign exchange (FX) market has normalized, with improved liquidity and participation by commercial banks. Following the opening of the capital account to East African Community (EAC) investors in 2015, the authorities plan to extend the liberalization to all foreign investors.

Tanzanian shillings/US$ NEER (RHS; 2010=100) Unrealistic budgets and weak commitment controls led to the accumulation of large arrears to suppliers and pension funds in recent years. The overall cash fiscal deficit remained relatively low in 2013/14 and 2014/15, at 3.3 percent of GDP. However, once corrected for significant budget expenditure arrears accumulation, the fiscal deficit actually was Page 13 in the 4-4.5 percent of GDP range. Budget execution in recent years was affected by unrealistically high revenue projections and financing shortfalls, which required inefficient intra-year expenditure adjustment mostly falling on investment. Delays in adjusting the budget and weak commitment controls were key factors behind the accumulation of arrears.

While the budget was built on ambitious but realistic revenue projections, expenditures still had to be adjusted for external financing shortfalls and to make room for expenditures carried over from 2014/15 and some of the new government’s priorities in education. The revised budget targets a lower overall deficit of about 3¼ percent of GDP (compared with 4.2 percent in the original budget and the program). Available information (on a cash basis) for the first three quarters suggests that this target is well within reach, reflecting a significant slowdown in the execution of capital expenditures. The stock of expenditure arrears decreased during the third quarter of the fiscal year (January-March 2016), reflecting the partial clearance of construction arrears and reversing an increase during the first two quarters. As a result, program design was changed during the third review with an assessment criterion (AC) on the overall cash fiscal deficit and a target of no accumulation of domestic expenditure arrears. Page 14 Foreign Aid (Percent of GDP) Grants Loans While central government debt has increased to about 38 percent of GDP, debt vulnerabilities remain limited. This increase reflects both fiscal deficits and the impact of the recent depreciation of the shilling on dollar- denominated debt. External borrowing on nonconcessional terms has increased rapidly in recent years, partly to make up for dwindling aid. Sources: Tanzanian authorities and IMF staff estimates. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has successfully implemented its monetary targeting framework, but there has been little progress in moving to an interest-based framework. Average reserve money growth has been kept within a 10–15 percent range and inflation at single digits. Once exchange rate effects are accounted for, credit and broad money growth, respectively at about 14 and 8 percent at end-April 2016, have picked up modestly. Progress on de- dollarization, which stalled in the wake of the shilling’s depreciation, has resumed. The BoT is building forecasting and policy analysis capacity, with IMF support, and started focusing more on managing commercial banks’ excess reserves, leading to less volatile interbank rates. However, the move to an interest-based framework has lagged behind, with repeated delays to introduce required reserve averaging, which is a precondition to implementing additional reforms. Nominal credit growth for April 2016, not corrected for the impact of the recent dollar depreciation, was about 19 percent. Measured at constant June 2014 exchange rates, FX deposits accounted for about 30 percent of M2 at end- April 2016 compared to a peak of 35 percent in April 2015.
