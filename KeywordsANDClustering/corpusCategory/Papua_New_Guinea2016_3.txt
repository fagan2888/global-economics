Against this background, staff’s view is that modifying the macroeconomic policy mix would facilitate PNG’s adjustment to the large terms of trade shock. The 2017 budget targets a prudent fiscal deficit that balances the need to bring down the debt ratio against the costs of excessive fiscal adjustment in terms of growth and poverty reduction, with a view to bringing the gross government debt-to-GDP ratio below 30 percent by 2021, consistent with the debt ratio ceiling in the authorities’ Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS). Going forward, additional revenue measures should be implemented to lessen the need for expenditure cuts. Greater exchange rate flexibility would help strengthen the external and fiscal positions, yielding a larger growth contribution from net exports. More rapid exchange rate adjustment implies a need for monetary policy tightening to moderate the inflationary effects of the depreciation; in this regard, measures to strengthen monetary policy transmission channels are needed given the large stock of excess liquidity. Partially sterilized foreign exchange intervention and large money-financed fiscal deficits have played central roles in the liquidity build up, while limited central bank independence and weak Page 12 government cash management have constrained efforts to absorb it. Thus far, excess liquidity has not led to inflationary pressures because structural impediments constrain private credit growth but this could change if the economy picks up.
