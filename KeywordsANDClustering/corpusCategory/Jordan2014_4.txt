Placing public debt on a downward trend requires further consolidation (¶9). The new Market Access Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows results consistent with the DSA presented in the staff report for the second review. Ensuring public debt sustainability will require a very significant net fiscal adjustment by both the central government and NEPCO. Assuming a consolidated fiscal adjustment of about 9 percent of GDP during 2015–18 (this includes an adjustment of one percent of GDP of the water authority of Jordan (WAJ)), public debt would continue to increase until 2015 (to 91 percent of GDP) before declining. Confidence intervals for debt do not show unsustainable upward trajectories under a variety of shocks. While the analysis points to vulnerabilities with debt structure and financing needs, financing available from Jordan’s international partners under the program addresses these in the near term. Staff welcomed plans to further lengthen the maturity profile of domestic debt, which will reduce roll-over risks and recommended to regularly access the domestic market rather than depending on the availability of external financing. Both the central government and the utilities need to go through major transformations. Some automatic adjustment is expected when refugees return to Syria (up to 1.4 percent of GDP per year; Box 1), arrears of the health funds are fully repaid (0.3 percent of GDP each year over three years), and possibly from a reduction in cash transfers (which are supposed to be disbursed only when the oil price is above $100 per barrel). Moreover, the medium-term strategies for NEPCO and the water authorities—if implemented as planned—will return the utilities to cost recovery by 2017 and 2019, respectively, yielding more than half of the The 2012 Article IV found that, historically, the impact of an increase in oil prices has been positive, due to the current account linkages to oil exporting countries. This relationship is likely reversed now, as Jordan is much more reliant on fuel imports. Paragraph numbers refer to the paragraphs in the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies. Page 11 adjustment. What has been lacking so far is a well-defined adjustment strategy for the central government to generate measures of 2½–4 percent of GDP from 2015 onward (depending on when and how quickly Syrian refugees return). Staff highlighted the advantage of setting in train most of the adjustment upfront to help anchor expectations. Jordan: Central Government, NEPCO, and Consolidated Deficits, 2012–19 (In percent of GDP) The burden of fiscal consolidation should be distributed equitably. Adjustment in the last years concentrated on reducing subsidies and affected mostly banks, hotels, telecommunication, rich households, and non-Jordanians. Staff noted the need for making the adjustment more broad-based to minimize distortions and maintain competitiveness. It reiterated that deep income tax reform will need to play a prominent role in any credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. This could reverse the revenue loss in recent years. Losses of 5½ percent of GDP in tax revenue during 2007–11 reflected to some extent tax policy choices—an increase in incentives and a revision in the income tax law costing the budget some 2 percent of GDP and regular tax amnesties possibly further eroding the tax base. Revenue also suffered from a weaker economy and a reduction in tariffs from trade arrangements. Nontax revenue declined as well by about 3½ percent of GDP, mostly related to real estate transactions and profits from public enterprises (each amounting to about one percent of GDP). Central Government The 2014 budget aims to strike a balance between consolidation and growth (¶s13–15). The primary deficit would decline to 4.5 percent of GDP. While this is only 0.2 percent of GDP tighter than the 2013 outcome, capital spending will accelerate by almost one percent of 20122013201420152016201720182019Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Program (Second Review) Central government primary deficit 1/7.45.44.52.91.41.00.5… Central government fiscal measures……1.81.61.50.30.5…NEPCO operating losses5.25.73.82.21.10.00.0…Reduction in losses…-0.51.91.61.11.10.0…Of which: from tariff increase0.50.20.50.50.70.60.0… Combined public deficit 2/12.611.18.35.12.41.00.5… Underlying consolidated balance 3/11.59.88.05.12.41.00.5… Projections Central government primary deficit 1/7.44.74.52.91.41.00.50.5 Central government fiscal measures……1.81.51.60.40.50.0NEPCO operating losses5.34.63.82.20.90.00.00.0Reduction in losses…0.70.71.61.30.90.00.0Of which: from tariff increase0.50.20.50.50.70.60.00.0Combined public deficit 2/12.79.38.35.12.31.00.50.5Underlying consolidated balance 3/11.68.08.05.12.31.00.50.5Sources: Jordanian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.1/ Excludes grant and transfers to NEPCO and WAJ.2/ Excludes arrears repayment by NEPCO.3/ Assuming constant inflows of Egypt gas at 100 million cubic feet per day and excluding arrears clearance in 2014-2019. Page 12 GDP and spending on health by 0.7 percent of GDP. These increased outlays would be financed by revenue measures, and, to a lesser extent, by savings on nonessential current spending. Both tax and nontax revenue will increase. Cabinet has approved a package of measures with an annual revenue impact of one percent of GDP, about half of which is already effective with the remainder to become effective shortly. The package relies heavily on fee increases. Staff welcomed these efforts, but cautioned that revenue might come in lower than expected (for instance, imposing customs fees might not be consistent with some bilateral trade agreements). To help limit risks, the pending measures should be implemented as soon as possible. Looking beyond 2014, staff felt that the scope for further raising fees was limited. Expenditure measures are relatively limited. Central government wage increases have been curbed to 2 percent. However, the wage bill would stay constant as a share of GDP, because of the need to hire new doctors and also a re-classification of wages, which had in previous budgets been recorded under capital spending. Staff welcomed savings from tightening the eligibility criteria for the cash transfers. It noted that the acceleration in capital spending in the last quarter of 2013 bodes well for implementing the full investment program in 2014. Staff also urged the authorities to front-load the transfers to the health funds to ensure early arrears clearance. Some of the increase reflects delayed revenue payments of 0.3 percent of GDP due in 2013 (part of this revenue was already received in the first quarter of 2014). Staff regretted these delays and urged the authorities to work closely with payees to prevent a repeat.

MeasuresAnnual impact Revenue Measures for 2014 Page 13 The medium-term fiscal strategy needs to be anchored in deep tax reform. Tax reform (¶16–17). Reform should rest on two main pillars, specifically the new income tax law and a reduction in tax incentives, which could collectively generate up to 2.5 percent of GDP. At the same time, stronger tax administration could improve compliance and help reduce tax arrears, contributing up to 0.5 percent of GDP (see paragraph 43). The income tax law at parliament is expected to raise revenue by 0.7 percent of GDP. Staff highlighted that there was scope to go much further, and pointed to the income tax threshold, which is by far the highest in the region (only about some 3 percent of the population is currently paying income taxes). A published report on existing tax incentives shows that foregone general sales tax revenue amounted to about 2 percent of GDP in 2012. Staff encouraged the authorities to streamline such incentives, including by eliminating in particular the exemptions on services and curbing incentives provided to economic zones (which also complicate tax administration).

Replacing the wheat flour subsidy (which is currently sold at about one tenth of the market price) with transfers to vulnerable parts of the population could yield savings of up to ½ percent of GDP. Recognizing the political sensitivities of such targeting, staff encouraged the authorities to continue with outreach. It also recommended preserving or, if possible, increasing social and capital spending. At the same time, staff believes that another ½ percent of GDP in savings could come from a gradual reduction in the wage bill. This could come about by reforming compensation and promotion policies. And, as outlined in the National Employment Strategy (NES), there is a need to gradually eliminate waiting lists in the Civil Service Bureau, and turn them into lists for active labor market programs in the private sector. Utilities The utilities are implementing their medium-term strategies (¶s 12, 20–23). Reforms are well underway to return NEPCO to cost recovery. Making the LNG terminal operational is the only medium-term option to reduce the large energy import bill. The construction is on track and the authorities hope to complete the terminal at the latest by mid-2015. Progress has been also made on renewable energies. Staff stressed that electricity transmission and distribution network improvements should go hand-in- hand with increased generation capacity. It noted that the strategy remains vulnerable to fluctuations in fuel supply and international oil prices. Establishing an automatic tariff adjustment, in the form of a variable fuel surcharge, would help to partly mitigate the impact of changes in the fuel mix and prices. Moreover, there is scope for reducing technical losses in the private sector-run electricity distribution companies. Lastly, more regular consultations between the ministry of finance and NEPCO would ensure that NEPCO can reduce its arrears as planned. A write-off of NEPCO’s debt to accelerate the company’s return to market access could be considered because the World Bank assesses that NEPCO is managed efficiently (so there is little moral hazard). The water strategy aims to cover operation and maintenance costs. It seeks balancing cost-savings measures to improve efficiency with investments to improve network performance and gradual increases in tariffs (Box 4). Staff welcomed that vulnerable parts of the population are exempted from tariff increases. Because implementation risks are high, careful monitoring will be essential to recalibrate as needed. Staff also noted that the strategy is based on major investments, requiring coordination with donors and the public investment program. A decision by the Electricity Regulatory Board could impose such a surcharge as it is already envisaged in the tariff structure. Page 15 Authorities’ Views The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment but highlighted political sensitivities and the need to balance consolidation with growth. They underscored their commitment to fiscal consolidation and, in the long term, to reduce net debt to 60 percent of GDP. The authorities, however, indicated that it was difficult to go for broad-based adjustment because the middle class had been adversely affected by the lackluster economic performance of the last years. Thus, measures would need to be introduced gradually being mindful also of any potentially negative impact on the economy. More grants are vital to shoulder the burden of the Syrian refugees. The budget is tight as it covers only the direct costs of Syrian refugees, but not any indirect costs. Moreover, the authorities feel that the direct costs included in the budget are potentially underestimated. They were also concerned that planned future tax increases could be perceived by the population— which was already suffering from lower-quality public services—as having to unduly pay for the Syria crisis. In this context, the authorities also highlighted donor fatigue as a risk if the Syria conflict is further protracted. Energy reforms are progressing. The authorities stressed their commitment to designing contractual frameworks (such as had been done for renewables) to attract investors while putting in place appropriate fiscal safeguards. They also expressed their concern with unpredictable gas supplies from Egypt, but pointed out that the LNG terminal would provide much-needed relief. While agreeing that it would be technically easy to implement automatic adjustments in electricity tariffs, the authorities thought that reaching a consensus on tariff reforms had been politically costly and thus wanted to wait with raising the issue.
