RISKS Economic activity is expected to accelerate in the coming years, driven by the investment boom. GDP growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2015 and 2016, rising to 7 percent in 2017–19. Aggregate investment is projected to peak at about 57 percent of GDP in 2015–16, before declining to 30 percent in 2017–19. After peaking at 16.8 percent in 2015, the fiscal deficit is projected to drop to less than 1 percent by 2019, with the completion of the ongoing investment projects triggering a fall in public investment spending from 27.5 percent of GDP in 2015–16 to 11.3 percent in 2017–19. The debt stock is expected to peak at about 80 percent of GDP in 2017, and decline thereafter as disbursements on loans for some infrastructure projects are completed. The inflation rate is projected to stabilize at 3.5 percent in 2016–18. The current account deficit is projected to peak at about 31 percent of GDP in 2015, declining to 14 percent of GDP in 2017–19. Currency board cover is projected at 109 percent throughout 2015–19. Broad money and domestic credit are expected to grow at about 10 percent and 16 percent a year respectively in 2015–19. An agreement signed in June 2015 between Djibouti and China on the establishment of a Chinese naval military base in Djibouti will yield rents of $20 million a year to government revenue. However, the medium-term outlook is exposed to considerable risks, subjecting the baseline growth projections to a high degree of uncertainty. First, Djibouti’s dependence on close trade links with Ethiopia creates risks. A growth slowdown or recession in Ethiopia—the main client of Djibouti’s ports, which are the key engine of the economy—could reduce the use of the ports, adversely affecting growth and fiscal revenues in Djibouti. This risk reinforces the need to diversify economic activity in Djibouti to reduce dependence on a single sector catering largely to a single client. Also, a shock to food production in Ethiopia would impact Djibouti directly which imports the bulk of primary food products from Ethiopia. Second, a sharp slowdown in China, the main source of funding for recent public investment projects, might affect the financing and execution of some of the projects. Third, the risk of political instability in Djibouti could rise in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections. Fourth, further terrorist attacks in Djibouti—which is exposed to spillovers from the conflict in Somalia—would undermine business confidence, investment and economic activity. Fifth, delays in the implementation of investment projects could increase the fiscal costs for projects for which loans have been disbursed. Staff assumes that investment drives economic growth by inducing demand for goods and services. The related job creation and business opportunities will also generate further income, which will also boost economic activity. Page 12 Figure 1.
