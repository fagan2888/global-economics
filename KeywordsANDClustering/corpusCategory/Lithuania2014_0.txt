The authorities remain on track with public finance repair and meeting conditions for euro adoption. Scope for bold reforms is limited in the four-party coalition led by the Social Democrats since late 2012, but two key projects are advancing well: (i) Prime Minister Butkevicius has staked his political survival on successfully adopting the euro next year, with the Lithuanian economy now well placed to do so, and (ii) fiscal consolidation is moving further ahead, with the public debt ratio now on the verge of starting to decline. Presidential and European elections are due in May. Incumbent President Grybauskaite is running as an independent and is leading opinion polls by a large margin. The economy has entered a broadly favorable trajectory of healthy and balanced growth—output is set to surpass its 2008 peak for the first time this year. Determined reform efforts since the 2008/09 crisis have produced strong economic growth of more than 3 percent in each of the past three years. Similar prospects for 2014 will put real GDP above 2008 levels, but this time the current account is in slight surplus, inflationary pressures are absent, and the banking system’s loan-to-deposit ratio is contained at not much above 100 percent. Nonetheless, income convergence with Western Europe has a long way to go, underscoring the need for continued reforms, policy discipline, and consistently high investment. Despite strong progress since the mid-1990s, Lithuania’s per capita GDP has advanced to only one-third of Western Europe’s and, at 11.4 percent, unemployment is too high. With demographic headwinds building and dividends from macroeconomic adjustment running their course, the onus for driving future income convergence will increasingly shift toward structural reforms.
