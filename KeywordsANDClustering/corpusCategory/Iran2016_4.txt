A comprehensive and coordinated plan of action would focus in the next-year on (i) restructuring and recapitalizing banks to safeguard financial stability and support growth, and (ii) defending low and stable inflation by reducing liquidity growth while progressing to a market-based monetary policy framework. Casting fiscal policy in a medium-term framework would over time create space for reform costs and higher public investment. Within the structural reform agenda, priority should be given in the next year to reforms to laws and regulations that facilitate foreign investment to ease domestic financing constraints. Over the medium-term, labor market reforms would foster job creation.
