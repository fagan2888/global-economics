Inward spillovers from changes in global liquidity conditions. Nigeria saw large portfolio inflows in 2012-13 and outflows in 2014-15, reflecting both “push” and “pull” factors, such as favorable domestic and external financial conditions, expected high growth rates and oil prices, and overall positive sentiment toward emerging markets. Going forward, the risks are tilted to sluggish net capital flows (SIP on Capital flows). Outward spillovers via regional trade channels. The foreign exchange restrictions are impacting exporters in trading partners such as South Africa, while the growth slowdown is adversely impacting growth in neighboring countries, mainly through informal trade and rapidly growing cross-border bank channels—for example, it is estimated that a 1 percent reduction in Nigeria’s growth generates a 0.3 percent reduction in Benin’s growth. Outward Spillovers to the region via financial channels. While the funding model appears to mitigate spillover risks through financial channels, the growing cross-border activity of Nigerian-based banks poses regulatory and supervisory challenges. Nine banks have a significant presence in Benin, the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. For example, United Bank of Africa has a meaningful market share (assets between 3 percent and 7 percent of GDP) in Liberia, Benin, and Burkina Faso, while Guaranty Trust Bank is systemically important (assets greater than 7 percent of GDP) for the Gambia.
