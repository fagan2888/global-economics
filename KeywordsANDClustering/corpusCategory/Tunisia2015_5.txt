Strengthening and expanding social safety nets is necessary to ensure growth dividends reach a larger portion of the population. The strengthening of existing social safety nets is progressing . The existing cash transfer system for the poor (PNAFN) has been expanded to cover 235,000 families (twice the level of 2010 and close to 60 percent of the estimated poor) and to provide more cash (average transfer has tripled to about 80 dollars per month). The evaluation study of the existing PNAFN program and Page 38 subsidized health program has identified fewer inclusion errors (leakages to non-poor) than previously estimated. Based on this finding, and the expansion of the unique social identification number (currently available for 8.5 million Tunisians), staff called for the quick adoption of a well- targeted social safety net (improving on the existing PNAFN) that could be fully functional by the end of the year. Reforming the public pension system is needed to ensure its financial viability (MEFP ¶45). The public sector retirement and social security Fund (CNRPS) has been running deficits, and depleted its cash balances by 2011. Since then, budget transfers—about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015—have been alleviating short-term cash needs to pay pensions. In view of its importance and social consequences, discussions with all stakeholders on a comprehensive reform have started but not yet concluded. In the meantime, the post-transition government has publicly announced a one- off voluntary increase in the retirement age to help alleviate short-term pressures. In line with existing actuarial studies, staff stressed that a sustainable long-term solution would also need to include changes in contribution parameters and pension benefits.
