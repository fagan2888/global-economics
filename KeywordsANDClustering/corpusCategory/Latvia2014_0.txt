Latvia adopted the euro on January 1, 2014, fulfilling a long-desired policy goal. The country has taken rapid strides since the crisis, undertaking a large internal devaluation and addressing severe macroeconomic imbalances. Over the last three years Latvia has achieved strong economic growth and a substantial fall in unemployment. Market confidence has soared; a 1 billion euro seven year government bond issued in January was heavily oversubscribed. The 2012 Article IV consultation supported euro adoption and broadly commended macroeconomic policies. The staff appraisal recommended continued fiscal consolidation at a gradual pace; adoption of a medium-term framework to anchor the budgetary process; strengthening the social safety net; and close supervision of non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system. Policy making has been in line with these recommendations to a considerable extent. The 2014 budget cements past fiscal gains while introducing some measures to protect vulnerable sections of society. The Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL) has been adopted and monitoring and supervision of NRD-specialized banks further strengthened.
