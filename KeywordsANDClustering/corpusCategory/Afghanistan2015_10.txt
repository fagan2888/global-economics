Data provision has shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance . The quality and timeliness of monetary, fiscal, and price data are broadly adequate, although coverage could be improved. Fiscal accounts cover only the central government. Limited data on the public enterprises are available, but qualitative information suggests that some of the largest enterprises are operating at a loss and represent a potential fiscal risk (Annex I). Data on national accounts, balance of payments, and social indicators also suffer from weaknesses in coverage and consistency. Recording and monitoring of debt statistics could be strengthened. The authorities have been working to improve compilation of debt statistics on a regular basis. They reached out to their creditors to enhance recording of disbursements and debt repayments and are working to improve data entry mechanism in Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management Software (CS-DRMS). In addition, they plan to reconcile treasury debt data with DAB, AFMIS, and Client Connections. Fund technical assistance, including from the IMFâ€™s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center, is also being provided to strengthen statistical data systems. Page 31
