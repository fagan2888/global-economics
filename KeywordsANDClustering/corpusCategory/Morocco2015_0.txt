A sound policy framework and prudent macroeconomic management have served Morocco well over the last few years, even though challenges remain. In response to shocks to external demand and terms of trade, the authorities undertook fiscal consolidation and important structural reforms, including subsidy reforms. These measures have helped reduce vulnerabilities, but challenges to growth, employment, and poverty reduction remain. The IMF is supporting the authoritiesâ€™ program through a two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement approved in July 2014, which provides insurance against external risks.
