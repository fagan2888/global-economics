Czech economic performance has been impressive recently, but challenges remain. A favorable external environment, high EU fund utilization, and accommodative macroeconomic policies have contributed to a strong growth performance, with output having surpassed its pre-crisis level, and a sharp decline in unemployment. This performance along with solid fundamentals has enhanced market confidence, as reflected in record-low bond yields and credit default swap rates. But inflation remains well below target, despite the central bankâ€™s (CNB) exchange rate floor and very low policy interest rates, due in part to the slump in oil prices. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but fiscal framework legislation that would anchor policy, avoid pro- cyclicality, and enhance predictability is yet to be approved by parliament. The strong growth performance has helped keep the government coalition that took office in January 2014 stable. The challenge for the authorities is to create conditions for sustainable strong growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
