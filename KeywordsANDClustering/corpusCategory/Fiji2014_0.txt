Persistent political turmoil, external shocks, and slow progress in structural reforms have contributed to low growth over the past three decades . After experiencing robust growth in the 1970s, economic growth in Fiji slowed to about 2 percent between 1980-2012. As in the case of other Pacific island economies, growth in Fiji has also been constrained by high transportation costs and the small size of its domestic economy. Fiji’s human development indicators are relatively strong and Fiji has achieved broad coverage in provision of basic services, with declining overall poverty levels even though progress in rural areas is lagging. Although Fiji has a more diversified production structure than most Pacific island economies, the economy remains heavily dependent on sugar and tourism. With the successful elections in September 2014, Fiji took a decisive step toward a return to democratic government, ending nearly eight years of military government since the coup in 2006. The international community welcomed the successful elections Voter participation rate was high at 84 percent, and FijiFirst – the party of (former interim) Prime Minister Bainimarama – received nearly 60 percent of the popular vote and thus secured about 2/3 majority in the Parliament. With the return to democracy, relations with traditional development partners and access to concessional finance will likely continue to improve (see Box 1). The confidence in the economy will receive a boost as political uncertainty is reduced. In terms of the economic policy, the new government is expected to continue the economic reform momentum established over the past few years.
