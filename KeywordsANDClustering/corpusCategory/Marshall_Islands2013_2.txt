While a growth rebound is expected in FY2014, the medium-term outlook is less promising. Growth is projected at 3.2 percent in FY2014, assuming the resumption of Compact funded infrastructure projects. The pickup in related construction activities is expected to continue through FY2017, and unwind in FY2018, with growth slowing significantly in that year. The fishing sector is expected to expand further, but at a slower pace (Box 1). In the medium-long term, growth potential is projected at about 1½ percent—weighted down by the scheduled reduction in Compact grants and limited private sector expansion. Inflation is expected to remain moderate at 1.7 percent in FY2014, thanks to subdued global commodity prices. A fiscal deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP is projected for FY2014. The temporary improvement compared to FY2013 is driven by one-off revenue factors—a grant from Papua New Guinea and a dividend transfer from the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority— more than offsetting increases in education and health spending in response to a US request. The current account deficit is expected to widen in FY2014 to nearly 21 percent of GDP The deterioration will be driven by the acquisition of two ships provided by a donor to improve domestic transportation, and higher imports for the resumption of infrastructure projects. In the medium term, however, the current account will tighten, as the impact of these temporary factors abates, and thanks to some expansion in fish exports and fishing license fees. The real exchange rate is close to its historical value. The real appreciation in FY2008–09 following the global commodity price shock was largely reversed, and the real exchange rate has remained fairly stable since then. Exports have been expanding and unit labor costs in the fishing sector—the main export— have been declining over the past three years. Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding and the use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender and the close ties with the United States provide a shelter against external instability.
