Public Debt in Nepal and other LICs (In percent of GDP) Nepal’s long-term vision is to graduate from least-developed country status by 2022 and to achieve middle income country status by 2030. Accordingly, key objectives of Nepal’s 13 th Development Plan (2013-16) are to achieve an annual growth rate of 6 percent and bring down the percentage of the population living below the poverty line to 18 percent by 2016. These objectives are echoed in the Budget for 2015/16 (mid-July 2015/mid-July 2016) and Monetary Policy for 2015/16. Experience in other low-income countries has shown that the recovery and reconstruction after a natural disaster such as the recent earthquakes takes considerable time. In light of this, discussions focused on the macroeconomic policy mix needed to support Nepal’s recovery while maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.
