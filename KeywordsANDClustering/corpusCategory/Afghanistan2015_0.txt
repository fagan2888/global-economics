Afghanistan is at an inflection point that will shape the country’s landscape for the years ahead . Since 2002, large aid flows supported reconstruction and growth and Afghanistan has made important strides in building its economy, infrastructure and institutions. Afghanistan’s Human Development Index (HDI) increased by about 2.5 percent annually between 2000 and 2013, above average HDI growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Notwithstanding this strong progress, Afghanistan has experienced an extended period of political and security uncertainty, which has held back economic activity and, more recently, led to increased emigration. Afghanistan remains a poor fragile state far from self-reliance; donor grants finance the budget and external current account deficits . Afghanistan ranks 194 out of 213 countries by GNI per capita in 2013 (World Bank Atlas method). A large illicit narcotics sector, difficult security conditions, corruption and weak institutions undermine development, constrain growth, and weigh on poverty reduction. Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of political power in 2014. The new national unity government wishes to tackle Afghanistan’s challenges. At the December 2014 London Conference, the international community welcomed plans to enhance productivity, stimulate private sector-led growth and mobilize domestic revenue, and reaffirmed their engagement with Afghanistan. The authorities committed to deliver on their commitments ahead of the September 5, 2015 Senior Officials Meeting (SOM). IMF management approved a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) for Afghanistan in May . The SMP (April–December 2015) aims at addressing fiscal and banking vulnerabilities, preserving macroeconomic stability, laying the ground for inclusive growth, and building a track record for a future IMF financial arrangement.
