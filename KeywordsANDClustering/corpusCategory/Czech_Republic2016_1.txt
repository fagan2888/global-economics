The economy has been growing at an exceptionally strong pace . Driven by robust domestic demand, output expanded by 4.2 percent—the highest rate in the CEE region—in 2015. Government consumption and investment, alongside an increase in inventories, accounted for close to half of 2015 economic growth. Private consumption benefitted from a boost to disposable income from higher employment and wages, and improving consumer sentiment. On the supply side, manufacturing, helped by strong external demand, and services, benefitting from improved domestic sentiment and disposable income, contributed equally to the growth in gross value added. The growth momentum continued this year (output expanded by 3 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1), with positive contributions by private consumption and investment, as well as external trade.

Page 10 Labor market performance has been strong. Solid private sector-led employment growth of 2 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1 helped reduce the unemployment rate to 4.1 percent in April. Labor participation reached 75 percent and hours worked continued to grow steadily. Real wage growth accelerated to 3.9 percent in 2016:Q1, boosted by an improving labor market, and increases in public sector wages and the minimum wage. Following the post-crisis freeze, the minimum wage has been increased by a cumulative 24 percent during 2014–16, thus bringing it to 35 percent of the average economy-wide wage compared with an EU average of 42 percent. However, the strong growth momentum has not translated into higher inflation. Headline inflation remained subdued at 0.3 percent last year and after picking up slightly to 0.5 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1, it eased to 0.1 percent y-o-y in May, as positive domestic developments were offset by external disinflationary factors; e.g., declining oil, gas, and food prices. Meanwhile, core inflation has been stable at around 1 percent and one-year ahead inflation expectations of financial markets (at 1.7 percent in May 2016) have recovered from their historic lows a year ago, while three-year inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2 percent. Fiscal performance was better than budgeted in 2015. The fiscal deficit narrowed from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.4 percent—against the 1.9 percent target—on account of robust tax revenues and spending discipline, implying a 0.5 percentage point tightening of the fiscal stance. But, the main driver was a significant shift in the structure of funding of public investment during the transition between EU fund cycles. To maximize absorption, government units shifted their focus to EU-funded investments, postponing domestically-financed investments. Public debt declined to 41 percent of GDP, as the government continued to economize on cash balances in the Single Treasury Account, by extending the scope of the State treasury system. Stripping net EU revenues out of the structural balance offers another measure of fiscal stimulus. The resulting structural deficit widened by 1 percentage point in 2015, capturing the impetus of EU-fund utilization. 2015 was the last year that capital expenditures could be financed from the 2007-13 EU fund allocation. Such spending has a much lower impact on the deficit than domestically-financed investment, as up to 85 percent of the projects is EU funded.

In November 2013 amid mounting disinflationary pressures, the CNB started using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing monetary conditions and introduced a CZK 27 per euro floor. Besides FX intervention upon the floor’s introduction, the koruna remained above that level until mid-2015. However, with appreciation pressures building, the CNB intervened to defend the floor, purchasing €12.2 billion during July 2015–April 2016. The koruna has been trading slightly above the floor subsequently. In February 2016, the CNB extended its commitment to the floor until end-2016. The banking sector is stable and credit growth continues to strengthen. Czech banks are mainly self-financed with deposits that grew by 8 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1. They continue to enjoy high capital buffers and profitability, and strong asset quality. The deleveraging process bottomed out at end-2014, and credit to the private sector has been growing at around 8-9 percent since August 2015, driven by demand for both corporate and household loans. Czech Republic’s external position is strong. The current account surplus widened to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, on account of an improvement in the income account due to stronger EU transfers and lower dividend payouts. The trade balance deteriorated slightly relative to GDP, owing to the higher import component of investment, which boomed in the transition between EU-fund cycles. Higher EU-fund absorption also boosted the capital account. Foreign direct investment was weaker than in previous years, while portfolio inflows increased significantly. The net international investment position improved to –31 percent of GDP, on the back of higher official reserves. Staff’s assessment is that the external position is broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies.
