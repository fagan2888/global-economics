Sustaining future growth will require steady improvements in training, education, healthcare, and institutions. Economic growth has facilitated important progress in poverty reduction over the past decade (see Figure 6). Going forward, capital accumulation in the public sector is expected to decelerate, and growth will need to depend much more on raising productivity. It will be essential to continue efforts to improve the quality of public education and healthcare, address skill mismatches including through internship and training programs, promote greater female labor force participation (e.g. by increasing the flexibility of working arrangements), and strengthen institutions. To secure enhancement in the quality of education, the authorities need to make sure that the two large increases in teachers’ salary planned over the next few years are adequately anchored to advancements in teachers’ qualifications. The authorities indicated that they are undertaking a concerted effort to improve education, enhance job qualifications, reduce skills mismatches, tackle youth unemployment, and integrate foreign workers. Staff analysis suggests that there are signs that the current account deficit is excessive, but this is expected to self-adjust as investment projects wind down and exports increase (Annex IV). The current account continues to be financed by FDI, while the external debt is deemed sustainable and resilient to shocks (Annex V). There is no compelling evidence of a need for an adjustment in the real exchange rate. Authorities are not overly concerned about the current account deficit and indicated that the economy has historically shown ample flexibility in responding to changes in the external environment.
