Policymaking in recent years has failed to address long-standing structural problems and proved counterproductive, contributing to an erosion of policy credibility and worsening growth prospects. Greater progress at addressing medium-term structural issues—particularly pertaining to the fiscal framework, at both national and subnational levels—would go a long way toward restoring policy credibility and boosting confidence, necessary for the return to strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth. Early implementation of key measures would also help moderate inflation expectations and facilitate an easing of monetary policy. Given the current environment and risks, the resilience of the banking sector should be bolstered and efforts to boost infrastructure investment scaled up.
