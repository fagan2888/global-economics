Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has had 18 actual, attempted or alleged military s; the resultant chronic political instability deterred growth. The last coup d’état took place in April 2012 in the midst of the presidential election and interrupted an otherwise successful three-year ECF-supported program. Its effects were profound, as external financing and tax collection collapsed, and political uncertainty under the transitional government formed in May 2012 fostered rent-seeking and corruption. Following pressure and financial support from the international community, successful presidential and parliamentary elections brought President Vaz’s government into power in July 2014. The security situation remains calm. A multi-party commission has been set up to review the constitution with the aim of clarifying the respective competencies of the President and the Prime Minister. In parallel, the government has initiated a comprehensive security sector reform that seeks to address pension benefits of the security forces, improve the efficiency of the national army, and end the recurrence of s. The April 2012 coupled with a fall in cashew nut prices exacerbated economic fragility and heightened food insecurity and poverty. Between 2012 and 2013, the Bissau– Guinean economy was hit by a 40 percent fall in the international price of cashew nuts, contributing to large trade deficits, despite a compression of imports. The external current account balance deteriorated by almost 13 percentage points of GDP during 2012–13; the overall balance of payments deteriorated as well and was financed mainly by drawing down government deposits at the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) as financial support from traditional foreign partners was suspended. The domestic impact of the shock was a large decline in farm-gate cashew nut prices by over 60 percent, and poverty soared. At the same time, food insecurity doubled to 40 percent in 2013, according to a survey by the World Food Program. The reduction of international support and the institutional decay deteriorated public finances and depressed economic activity. Despite scaling back current and capital spending, the government accumulated domestic and external arrears and social conditions worsened (which, among other things, ignited teacher strikes). The cash-strapped government increased its reliance on simplified spending procedures. The economically disruptive coup d’état exacerbated the chronic regulatory forbearance in the banking sector, leaving two of the four banks with excessive levels of nonperforming loans. In 2012 the economy contracted by 1.8 percent and barely recovered in 2013 with a growth of 0.8 percent (Text Table 1). Expenditures not classified in the expenditure tables presented by the National Budget Directorate. Regulatory forbearance persists on the regional level, see: IMF, 2015, “West African Economic and Monetary Union, Staff Report on Common Policies of Member States”, SM/15/56. Page 12 Text Table 1. Guinea-Bissau: Recent Economic Developments In July 2014, the new democratically-elected government initiated an ambitious reform agenda to address Guinea-Bissau’s developmental challenges within the framework of strategic plan with donor support. The government has recently adopted a Strategic Plan that aims to consolidate past progress and advance socio-economic development in 2014–18, and launch Guinea-Bissau onto a virtuous cycle of progress by 2025. Encouraged by the renewed commitment of the country, development partners resumed support, and reaffirmed this through commitments at the roundtable held in Brussels on March 25, 2015 (Box 1). Prior to this, the IMF provided policy advice and financing in November 2014 under the Rapid Credit Facility to help address the country’s urgent balance of payments and fiscal needs. The government successfully issued FCFA 15 billion in Treasury bonds to clear wage arrears, and prepared 2014 and 2015 budgets that were approved unanimously by the Parliament. While reforms largely halted under the military and transitional governments, the newly elected authorities have generally been responsive to Fund policy advice, and continue to build on technical assistance (TA) recommendations to advance structural reforms and improve policy formulation (Box 2). Box 1. Outcome of the Brussels Donor Roundtable of March 25, 2015 The Government prepared a 10-year development and transformation plan with an intermediate 2020 milestone, consisting of six axes, twenty-three fields of actions, fifty-three programs and 115 projects for a cost of US$2.1 billion. At the Brussels roundtable, bilateral and multilateral development partners pledged approximately US$1.5 billion, of which 40 percent would be grants, 30 percent loans and the conditions for the remainder yet to be determined. The annual and sectoral breakdown of the pledges is yet to be confirmed. About US$48.2 million (out of an estimated cost of US$82 million) for the special pension fund for demobilization of army personnel have been committed so far by international partners. However, the details of a more comprehensive reform–with a possible cost of US$260 million, as presented at the roundtable–are yet to be defined. The current macroeconomic framework integrates foreign-financed public investment of US$545 million for 2015–20, significantly less than pledged but a substantial scaling up compared to the past. This excludes any envisaged amounts for the security sector reform, which is expected to be financed from both foreign and domestic sources (including budgetary transfers into the special pension fund). The public investment program would be adjusted as more information becomes available. 20102011201220132014Real GDP growth (%)4.49.4-1.80.82.5Real per capita income growth (%)2.16.8-4.0-1.40.3Consumer price inflation (%, annual average)1.15.12.10.8-1.0Total revenue (incl. grants, % of GDP)20.316.711.411.621.0Total Expenditures (% of GDP)20.518.113.713.423.1Overall fiscal balance (incl. grants, commitment basis, % of GDP)-0.2-1.4-2.2-1.8-2.2Overall fiscal balance (excl. grants, commitment basis, % of GDP)-9.8-8.0-4.6-5.3-11.2External Current Account (incl. grants, % of GDP)-8.7-1.5-8.8-4.4-1.2Total Public Sector debt (Gross, % of GDP)69.043.747.349.851.9Source: IMF staff estimates Page 13 Box 2. Guinea-Bissau: Response to Fund Advice from the 2013 Article IV Consultation Fund Advice Response Restore macroeconomic stability and foster economic growth by putting in place the conditions required for political stability and sustained support from development partners. Adopt a prudent budget for 2013, which should be based on realistic revenue and financing estimates, and implement strict budgetary management in the face of tight financing constraints. Enhance growth prospects; improving the business environment; promoting economic diversification; increasing access to finance; and maintaining debt sustainability. While progress was limited under the transitional government, the new government formed in 2014 sought political unity upon assumption of office and stepped up implementation of Fund advice. They initiated structural reforms that have begun to show good results in strengthened efficiency at the revenue authority. The government has adopted a Strategic Plan to address the country’s developmental needs and catapult it onto a virtuous cycle of progress by 2025. For the medium-term, 2015–18, the plan aims to boost infrastructure investments, encourage industrialization and promote urban development. The plan drew considerable support from development partners at the Brussels Roundtable in March 2015. The authorities have embarked on a security sector reform focused at promoting professionalism in the security forces. While the 2013 budget was not fully implemented by the transition government, the new government presented in late-2014, the 2014, and 2015 budgets to parliament and got them unanimously approved. Furthermore, the authorities established a Treasury committee that aims at tightening expenditure commitment procedures to improve non-priority spending monitoring and contain them to budgeted levels. To strengthen the business environment, the authorities have committed to audit the hitherto ill-managed fund for industrialization of agricultural products (FUNPI), and are determined to use the results from the audit to restructure or completely eliminate the fund. They continue to implement a fuel pricing mechanism that adjusts domestic pump prices to international price movements. The authorities have extended SYDONIA ++ (a global software for capturing and reporting customs data) to one major entry port, tightened controls over fuel imports and streamlining fuel tax exceptions, intensified audits of large taxpayers, established Bissau Link—a system for tax risk assessment of imports and scanning of containers—and set up a one-stop shop for potential investors.
