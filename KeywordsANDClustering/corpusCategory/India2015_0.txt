CHALLENGES Policy Stance and Output Gap (In percent) While India’s external vulnerabilities have moderated since September 2013 due to effective policy actions and strengthened external buffers, risks remain. India was hit hard during the post-May 22, 2013 taper tantrum period, in line with other emerging markets, due to concerns about its weak growth prospects, high inflation, and large external imbalances. In response, the authorities’ implemented wide-ranging policies to contain market volatility, correct imbalances and build buffers against external shocks. Notably, against the background of still-limited policy space, they ran pro-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy stances. As a result, India’s underlying vulnerabilities have receded more than those of most emerging markets. Notwithstanding this, weaknesses in corporate financial positions and bank asset quality remain, as do long-standing structural impediments.

The Bharatiya Janata Party scored a landslide victory in India’s parliamentary elections in May 2014. The new government has initiated economic reforms, including diesel price deregulation and raising natural gas prices, taken steps towards more flexible labor markets, commenced reforms in the coal sector, and is enhancing financial inclusion (see Text Table 1 on policy reforms undertaken in fiscal year 2014/15). Nonetheless, much remains to be done to raise potential growth, particularly in areas of reforming factor and product markets, many of which are on the concurrent list (areas where the central government and states can legislate), and thus will require consensus building to implement. Some states have initiated reforms on the concurrent list, such as labor market reforms, and have requested presidential assent, a modality that could enable states to reform at a faster pace.

Real GDP growth had slowed sharply to around 4½ percent in 2012/13 and 2013/14, as a result of growing imbalances, binding supply constraints, and subdued sentiment. However, as vulnerabilities receded and sentiment revived, growth rebounded to 5½ percent in H1 2014/15, driven by a revival in exports, and a rebound in industrial activity. Also, CPI inflation has receded from 11.2 percent in November 2013 to 5 percent in December 2014. This slowing of inflation was underpinned by several policy actions, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the repo rate by a cumulative 75 bps between September 2013 and January 2014, limited increases in agricultural procurement prices, the release of food grain stocks, lower oil prices, and favorable base effects. India’s improved near-term growth prospects and lower external vulnerabilities have led to sizable capital inflows, appreciation of the rupee, and a rise in equity prices to record highs. Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly aligned, but progress on structural reforms has been partial. The fiscal deficit target set by the authorities was met in 2013/14, which staff had endorsed, and staff also supports the authorities’ intentions regarding the pace of medium-term consolidation. Diesel prices were deregulated and LPG subsidies were capped, leading to a lower fuel subsidy bill. The stance of monetary policy was tightened in 2013/14 to reduce inflation, consistent with Fund advice. The RBI has moved to make the containment of inflation its primary objective, with headline CPI inflation now the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy. Almost all key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update have been implemented (Text Table 2). Progress on product and labor market reforms has been limited, though some labor market reforms have been initiated by the center and a few states. Sources: Datastream; and IMF staff calculations.
