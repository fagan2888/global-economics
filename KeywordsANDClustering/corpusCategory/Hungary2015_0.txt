Economic recovery has gained momentum and vulnerabilities have declined, but underlying weaknesses continue to weigh on Hungary’s growth potential. Expansionary macroeconomic policies contributed to strong output growth in 2014 and real GDP is about to reach its pre-crisis level. Vulnerabilities have declined, but debt levels remain elevated and the associated high financing needs pose significant risks, particularly given the heavy reliance on non-resident funding, and the large concentration of the investor base. Thus, a shift in market sentiment could destabilize the economy, particularly in light of its exposure to exchange rate risk. Weak underlying fundamentals, along with policy unpredictability and a frail business environment cloud Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects. A comprehensive strategy in needed to nurture a continued recovery and stronger medium-term growth prospects, while reducing vulnerabilities. The role of state in the economy has been increasing. The government acquired energy companies and foreign bank subsidiaries, increased the scope of sectoral taxes, and boosted disposable incomes by expanding public works, cutting administered utility prices, and introducing the Settlement Act, which required banks to compensate borrowers for deemed unfair lending practices (Appendix I). In contrast, the government welcomes FDI in manufacturing, where it sees significant benefits to the Hungarian economy. Recently, it committed to improve the operating environment of banks.
