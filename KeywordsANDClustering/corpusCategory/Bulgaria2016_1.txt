Economic activity has been buoyant, supported increasingly by domestic demand. Real output grew by 3 percent in 2015, benefiting from stronger-than-expected demand from European markets. Domestic demand picked up in the second half of 2015 on account of improved labor market conditions and the rush to utilize EU funds available under the 2007–13 program period. GDP continued to grow at around 3 percent during the first half of 2016, with private consumption overtaking exports as the main driver of growth, offsetting weakening export growth and a slump in EU-fund related public investment. Deflation has largely been driven by international commodity prices. Prices have fallen more than in the euro area in recent months as energy and commodity prices have a larger weight in the Bulgarian Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basket than in the euro area. While the major driving forces of deflation are external, some internal factors, including food and communication prices, have also contributed. Most recent data point to a gradual easing of deflation, supported by decelerating energy price declines and a pick-up in food prices. The labor market has continued to tighten, with wage pressure increasing. The Labor Force Survey-based unemployment rate declined to 8.2 percent in Q2 2016, reflecting growing employment opportunities and a shrinking labor force. Nominal wages in the private sector rose by around 10 percent in 2015 and by about 8 percent year-on-year during the first half of 2016 on the back of strong private sector labor demand and an increase in the monthly minimum wage of 8.6 percent in 2015 and 13.6 percent in January Recent trends in the minimum wage and its ratio to the average wage have been in line with those of regional peers. The minimum amounted to €189 on average in 2015, and was increased to €215 in January 2016.

The current account registered a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and stood at 2.8 percent of projected 2016 GDP during January-July 2016. FDI has remained subdued. External debt declined modestly, to about 77 percent of GDP at end-July 2016, reflecting lower liabilities by both public and private debtors. The external sector assessment (Annex I) finds that Bulgaria’s exports have remained competitive and the HICP-based real exchange rate has moved in line with that of peers in recent years. Nevertheless, the ULC-based real exchange rate has appreciated faster than in peers reflecting in large part catching-up, as Bulgaria’s wage level is still the lowest in the EU. Competitiveness concerns could arise should wages continue to grow faster than productivity. Bulgaria’s reserves were 159 percent of the standard IMF metric in 2015, slightly above the 100–150 percent range considered appropriate. mm z hu cc ee = mm Page 12
