Staff expects growth to accelerate to 3 percent in 2015. Investment, supported by growing business confidence, higher capacity utilization and greater take-up of EU funds, is expected to be the main driver of growth. At the same time, the strength of the labor market and improved consumer confidence would provide a boost to private consumption. On the other hand, while export growth remains robust, the net export contribution is projected to turn negative, as strong domestic demand would boost imports. Inflation is likely to remain very low in 2015, before rising toward the target in 2016, as base effects from the oil price shock fade and declining economic slack starts to pull inflation up. (These projections assume the exchange rate floor remains in place through mid-2016, as the authorities have announced.) Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around 2¼ percent. Finally, the current account is projected to remain in surplus, thanks to a lower oil import bill, before moving toward a small deficit on account of improving investment and in line with fundamentals. Risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—are broadly balanced. On the upside, the positive effects from lower oil prices, supportive macroeconomic policies, the ongoing recovery in Czech Republic’s trade partners, and ECB’s quantitative easing could turn out to be larger than currently forecast. On the downside, if the euro area recovery were to falter, the Czech economy would be negatively affected through the trade channel. The impact would be larger still if low growth turned self-reinforcing through low investment. Moreover, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region or reemergence of sovereign stress in Europe could affect exports and also create negative confidence effects.

The authorities broadly agreed on the near-term outlook, medium-term prospects, and the balance of risks. Among positive factors affecting the outlook, they emphasized their stepped-up efforts to boost infrastructure spending, in particular associated with EU-financed programs. They also saw an upside to medium-term growth on account of a strong pipeline of FDI, both due to the global investment cycle and gains in Czech Republic’s relative cost position. Downside risks were, in their view, mostly external, related to the possible intensification of geopolitical tensions and its negative impact on market sentiment in the region. Finally, they were somewhat concerned about renewed financial stesss in the euro area, possibly related to developments in Greece. However, they emphasized that direct spillovers from a prolonged period of financial market turbulence were quite small, given the very limited exposure of the banking system to Greece.
