Future budgets will need to devote resources to foster peace and increase social and infrastructure spending while seeking to gradually reduce current spending over time. At first, peace will likely require budget allocations to reintegrate militias into the government and begin a disarmament program. At the same time, sustaining peace and reconciliation over time will require a well-designed demobilization program to allow for the gradual absorption of former combatants into the private sector together with a civil service strategy to keep a lean and more efficient government. Furthermore, social and infrastructure needs are massive in South Sudan, now Page 17 exacerbated by the recent conflict. Attending to these needs will require a gradual scaling up of investment in the social and physical infrastructure (health, energy, transport, and water). The medium-term fiscal framework (as portrayed in Table 6 and in the accompanying debt sustainability analysis) contains preliminary estimates of this path. The authorities recognize that the process will need to be properly planned and timed as cost overruns, poor governance, or lack of complementary infrastructure (e.g., roads) could significantly weaken the effectiveness of the investments. In order to ensure the targeting of non-oil balance for stabilization and intergenerational savings, and given finite oil reserves, the non-oil domestic current fiscal balance would be an appropriate medium-term fiscal anchor. A clear commitment to development, together with technical assistance and donor involvement will be needed to deliver visible results in these areas.
