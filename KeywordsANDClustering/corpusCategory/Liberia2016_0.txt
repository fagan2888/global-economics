Context The Ebola epidemic and the fall in commodity prices have laid bare the vulnerabilities of Liberia’s economy . The economy is still reeling from the devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014–15, that, besides triggering a human tragedy, stopped GDP growth, setting back the country’s development. The outbreak coincided with the decline of world commodity prices, which is buffeting Liberia’s economy, heavily dependent on the natural resource sector. Lower commodity prices have drastically reduced activity, triggered the delay or cancellation of investment plans, undermined budget revenues, and worsened long-standing weaknesses in the financial sector. The Ebola epidemic has been generally contained, and occasional flare-ups have been swiftly addressed . The WHO has declared Liberia Ebola free on three occasions, first in May 2015, then in September 2015, and January 2016 after the recurrence of small-scale infections. With capacity vastly improved, the government has reacted quickly to tackle and terminate the small Ebola flare-ups, but a resurgence cannot be ruled out due to lack of a vaccine and the fragility of the health systems. The twin shocks are delaying Liberia’s exit from fragility . Liberia is a post-conflict country with significant infrastructure and human capital deficits (Annex I), as shown by limited progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Table 1). Poverty levels are very high, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, poverty declined from 64 percent in 2007 to 54 percent in 2014 thanks to the authorities’ policies, assistance from donors, and a supportive external environment. Food insecurity remains a concern for at least 49 percent of Liberian households. At 3 percent in 2014, the unemployment rate is relatively low compared to the regional average, reflecting the predominance of agriculture in the labor market. But, 74 percent of the employed are vulnerable, due to extensive informality and under-employment. The young demographics, with 42 percent of the population under 15, underlines the need for strong job creation to absorb the fast-rising labor force. Liberia faces important political and security transitions . In the coming months, the country is preparing for its first democratic transition of power with the October 2017 general elections, which will end the two-term presidency of Ms. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. A large number of candidates is expected to be seeking the presidency. In the meantime, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) is drawing down its contingent and handing security over to national security forces. 2016 Article IV discussions focused on policies to boost Liberia’s resilience . In the fiscal area, the less favorable medium-term external environment requires stepping up the mobilization of domestic resources to protect development spending. In a highly dollarized economy, Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) policies should continue to focus on reconstituting buffers to mitigate shocks, and improving vigilance of the banking sector in light of increased vulnerabilities. Growth diversification would reduce the economy’s dependence on iron ore and rubber, reducing vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks. Page 10 Follow-up on the 2012 Article IV recommendations has been limited The 2012 consultation called for: (i) building policy buffers to mitigate vulnerabilities; (ii) harnessing expected strong natural resource revenue to support the development agenda; and (iii) creating a favorable business climate to support broad-based growth and job creation. Progress was largely challenged by delays in budget passage and implementation, weak governance as reflected in the road project audit by the General Auditing Commission (GAC), the Ebola epidemic, and the decline in commodity prices that have eroded the fiscal space and reversed central bank’s reserves accumulation efforts. The 2012 Article IV analysis laid the ground for the current ECF (Box 1). Box 1. Implementation of the ECF Program The 2012 ECF arrangement laid the basis for the Fund’s stepped-up support to Liberia during the Ebola crisis . The ECF arrangement, with an access of 40 percent of quota (US$78.9 million), was designed to accelerate broad-based growth and poverty reduction while maintaining macroeconomic stability. In the wake of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, the program was buttressed by an augmentation of access of 25 percent of quota (US$47.9 million) and a disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for 25 percent of quota (US$45.7 million) to enhance the country’s ability to withstand the shock. In February 2015, the IMF also provided debt relief for 20 percent of quota (US$36.5 million) under the newly established Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to cover urgent budgetary and balance of payments needs. Taking into consideration the delay in the program caused by Ebola epidemic, the program was re-phased and extended until December 2016. The program has been affected by the Ebola epidemic and uneven policy performance . By and large, the ECF, which is aligned with the authorities’ own poverty reduction strategy, the Agenda for Transformation (AfT, Annex II) has so far been successful in helping the authorities maintain macroeconomic stability and lay the basis for poverty reduction. However, after the swift completion of the second and third reviews, the fourth review was delayed by the Ebola epidemic, which derailed the implementation of structural reforms, and policy slippages. Unfunded spending commitments on road projects totaling about 3.8 percent of GDP, highlighted Public Financial management (PFM) weaknesses, and quasi-fiscal activities by the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) combined with persistent large central bank operational deficits, held back the accumulation of international reserves. The fourth ECF review was completed in December 2015 based on the authorities’ corrective actions to address PFM weaknesses and strengthen the CBL’s buffer position. Progress towards the fifth review has been mixed so far . All indicative targets for end-December 2015 were met. However, reflecting the impact of commodity price decline, the end-December 2015 performance criterion (PC) on government revenue was missed by US$7 million because of lower tax revenues from the natural resource sector. Furthermore, the PC on net foreign exchange reserves position was missed by US$20 million owing to exceptional liquidity support to the banking system, large foreign exchange interventions, and lower-than-programmed sales of foreign exchange from the government. Two of the nine structural benchmarks for the fifth review were met, while two were completed with delay, and five have not yet been completed. Discussions with staff are continuing on policies that would allow completing the fifth review The authorities are closely working with staff to implement corrective measures to address policy slippages. Agreement has been reached on the main lines of the FY2017 budget recently submitted to the Legislature, including strong tax and spending measures, and further structural reform mostly focusing on PFM. Discussions continue on addressing risks in the financial sector. Based on Liberia’s pre-14 th review quota of SDR 129.2 million. Page 11 B. Recent Economic Developments and Short-Term Outlook Ebola and weak commodity prices have halted the momentum of the economy (Text Table 1, Figure 1, and Table 2) After a decade of strong performance, growth stalled in 2014–15 The real GDP growth rate dropped from 8.7 percent in 2013 to 0.7 percent in 2014 and 0 percent in 2015 as the mining and rubber sectors were hit by the Ebola outbreak and the fall in commodity prices. But activity is expected to rebound modestly to 2½ percent in 2016, underpinned by recovery of services, as confidence post-Ebola picks up, and an expansion in gold production. Inflation is set to remain in single digits . The inflationary pressures generated by the economic recovery are expected to be partly compensated by the end of the Ebola-related food supply bottlenecks. Inflation is thus projected to average 8.4 percent in 2016, up slightly from 7.7 percent in 2015. Low activity of foreign concessions is impacting government revenues . As a result of disappointing revenues, Cabinet has submitted to parliament a revised FY2016 budget, with both revenues and expenditures equally reduced by 3 percentage points of GDP or 11 percent of the original budget, leaving unchanged the envisaged budget deficit at Est.Est.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Real sectorReal GDP0.70.02.54.75.25.76.06.5Consumer prices (annual average)9.97.78.48.37.77.17.17.5Central government operations Total revenue and grants27.432.532.130.327.127.527.627.6 Total expenditure and net lending29.340.939.237.033.431.931.731.4Overall fiscal balance, including grants-1.9-8.4-7.0-6.8-6.3-4.4-4.1-3.8Public external debt13.223.028.232.335.937.538.238.5Monetary sectorCredit to private sector (annual change)5.68.110.39.410.811.211.512.7External sectorCurrent account balance, including grants-32.5-33.6-31.3-27.7-26.6-26.6-26.5-27.0Gross official reserves (millions of U.S. dollars)411446457509581638688748Months of imports of goods and services 2.42.62.73.03.33.53.63.7CBL's net foreign exchange position (millions of U.S. dollars)179164189227302373433493Terms of trade (annual percent change)-12.1-25.5……………… Sources: Liberian authorities and IMF staff estimates and projections.

Despite the cut in expenditure, the authorities maintained spending on health and education as envisaged in the original budget. Based on the revised budget, the overall FY2016 government deficit, including off-budget items, is projected to remain around 7 percent of GDP. Exports have declined, but the current account is expected to strengthen thanks to import compression . With weaker iron ore and rubber prices, total export earnings declined by 45 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and the current account deficit rose to 34 percent of GDP from 32 percent in 2014. The exchange rate depreciated by about 7 percent in 2015, broadly in line with inflation. The real effective exchange rate strengthened by 11.6 percent reflecting the inflation differential with trade partners and the rising U.S. dollar (Text Chart 1 and Annex III). In 2016, exports are expected to remain weak, despite rising earnings from gold, but imports should decline after the end of the temporary surge in Ebola-related imports of materials and machinery in 2014–15, with the current account deficit falling to 31 percent. The CBL’s net foreign exchange position has declined in 2015 . Gross reserves have risen from US$411 million in 2014 to US$446 million in 2015 (2.6 months of imports). In contrast, the net foreign exchange position of the CBL declined from US$179 million to US$164 million due to operational losses and liquidity support to the banking sector. In 2016, gross reserves are projected to increase to US$457 million and net foreign exchange position should rise to US$189 million, assuming strong policies by the CBL, including implementation of its operational budget, and sufficient foreign exchange sales by the government. The two shocks have further eroded bank asset quality and profitability . With subdued economic activity, non-performing loans (NPLs) as a percent of total loans have risen to above 20 percent in 2015, weighing on already weak profitability and undermining credit growth recovery. The import series is being revised upward after migration to the ASYCUDA customs data platform which has a more robust coverage. = EE EE Page 13 Figure 1. Liberia: Recent Economic Developments Economic recovery is expected to be driven by gold, agriculture, and services. Prices for key commodities have decline sharply. Gross official reserves have remained broadly stable, but the CBL’s net foreign exchange position is weak. Inflation is projected to remain in single digits, but remains vulnerable to high oil prices and exchange rate depreciation. The current account deficit will remain high. Declining natural resource revenues and external support are compressing government spending. Sources: Liberian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
