Sri Lanka has made notable advances in recent years, and appears to be on its way to joining the ranks of upper middle income countries . Per capita GDP has increased from US$869 in 2000 to US$3,256 in 2013, and there appears to be an ongoing shift toward higher value added industrial production, as well as rapid expansion of services. The years following the end of civil conflict in 2009 have seen an acceleration of activity. Overall real GDP growth has risen (albeit sometimes on the back of unsustainable booms in credit and consumption), and new areas of economic activity (tourism and transport, IT, and other services) have emerged. Inflation has also come down—from an average of 12.6 percent during 2001–08, to mid-single digits. Infrastructure has also visibly improved. Vulnerabilities have generally moderated with stronger economic performance and a commitment to fiscal consolidation. Nonetheless, public debt and debt service remain high by international comparison, reserves are limited, tax revenues are low, and medium- term sustainability depends heavily on continued growth and a positive external environment. Notable gains have been made in poverty reduction, and the government has made a public commitment to inclusive growth and development . The national poverty headcount ratio declined from 8.9 percent in 2009/10 to 6.7 percent in 2012/13. Also, poverty headcount has significantly declined on a $2 and $1.25 scale from 29.1 (7.0) to 23.9 (4.1) percent, respectively within the last two surveys. Regionally, poverty headcount ratios were lower in 18 districts and higher in 4 districts in 2012/13 compared with 2009/10. Available data suggest a gradual decrease in inequality at national and most provincial levels with the Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.49 in 2009/10 to 0.47 in 2012/13. The lowest ratio is in the North-Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces of Sri Lanka and highest in the North and North-Western provinces of the country. The government espouses an inclusive development strategy that focuses on six pillars: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) spatial transformation (creating economic links through improved infrastructure; (iii) human resources development; (iv) rural-centric development; (v) resilience to climate and external shocks; and (vi) five hubs of development (knowledge, shipping, energy, aviation and commercial hubs.

Page 5 Policy consistency with staff advice . The direction of the authorities’ macroeconomic Political context and medium-term vision . President Rajapaksa is in his second term of office, having been first elected to the presidency in 2005. Presidential elections are expected in 2015. The President’s second five-year plan (from 2010–15) aims to raise per capita income to US$4,000 by 2016 and to reach real GDP growth of 8 percent or more. Sustaining the current momentum of development and growth will require a continued focus on macroeconomic stability, high and sustained investment in infrastructure and human capital, and continued progress in fiscal consolidation and debt reduction. policies since the 2013 Article IV Consultation has been broadly in line with past staff advice. Progress was made on fiscal policy but in some areas more gradually than advocated by staff. The government has implemented a number of recommendations made by the Presidential Tax Commission (which was complemented by IMF technical assistance). Importantly, fuel and electricity tariffs were adjusted in 2013, and measures taken to put the state-owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) on a more commercial footing and eliminate their financial losses. Also in 2013, the VAT was extended to the wholesale and retail level. In line with staff advice and the authorities’ medium-term objectives, the 2014 budget targeted a further reduction of the deficit. The VAT threshold at the retail level was also lowered from Rs 500 million to 250 million in quarterly turnover to broaden the tax base. Ongoing work, with support of IMF TA, focuses on introducing a formal system for the collection, analyzing, and reporting of commitment data. Reform of tax holidays and exemptions remains a key objective. On monetary policy, the authorities moved to a more aggressive easing than recommended by staff, but with no adverse affects given low private credit growth.
