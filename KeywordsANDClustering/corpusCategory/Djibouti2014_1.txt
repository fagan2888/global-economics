The surge of public and private investment is expected to accelerate economic growth. Aggregate investment is projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2010–13 to 52 percent in 2014– 16, and public investment from 11 percent to 25 percent of GDP over the same period. Staff projects that GDP growth will rise from 5 percent in 2013, to 6 percent in 2014, and to 6.5 percent in 2015, and will stabilize at about 7 percent in 2016–19. By 2016, when aggregate investment is projected to begin to fall, some of the major investment projects should be operational and supporting growth. Inflation was 2.4 percent in 2013. It is projected at about 3 percent in 2014, and expected to pick up to about 3–3.5 percent in 2015–19 as the large capital spending fuels demand for housing, transport, and other services. High public investment spending is exerting considerable fiscal and external debt pressures. The loans for the railway and the water pipeline projects will be serviced from the central government budget until they can be transferred to the relevant public companies when the projects are operational and generating enough revenues to service the loans. Domestic revenues are expected to fall as a percentage of GDP in 2016–19 compared with 2013–15 for the following reasons. First, the activities driving growth will be mostly tax-exempt, implying that growth will not be accompanied by a concomitant increase in fiscal revenues. Second, rents for the military bases (nontax external revenues) are fixed by bilateral agreement in nominal terms. As a result, over time, they diminish as a percentage of GDP. Third, outstanding tax arrears, which account for the rise in tax revenues in 2013 and 2014, would diminish after 2014 as most arrears are expected to have been collected. Meanwhile, interest payments on outstanding government debt will increase to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2017–19, and by 2019, these will be accompanied by large debt amortization payments. The fiscal deficit, on a commitment basis, should rise from 5.9 percent in 2013 to 12 percent in 2014, and peak at 13.8 percent in 2015, financed mainly by external borrowing. As a result, in 2017–18, external public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to peak at about 81.5 percent of GDP. The increase in the rent for the U.S. military base and a grant from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will boost revenues. The rent for the base has increased from US$38 million a year to US$63 million with effect from May 2014. The GCC grant is for US$50 million Page 10 a year over four years. It will be used to cover debt service vis-à-vis Arab donors and to finance social and investment spending. Of the US$185 million received from the partial privatization of the ports in 2013, about US$79 million was allocated to the 2013 budget, US$73 million to 2014, and the balance of US$33 million to 2015. The allocations covered investment projects, including government contribution to the Djibouti-Ethiopia railway project and the water pipeline project, and current spending items such as support for the newly launched health insurance scheme. The current account deficit is projected to widen from 23.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 28 percent of GDP in 2014–15, because of large capital goods imports financed by the project loans or FDI. These high imports will exceed an expected increase in export revenue, mainly from port services. The real effective exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued (Annex III). Declining international oil prices are expected to bode well for the Djibouti economy but would eventually reduce fiscal revenues. All fuel products consumed in Djibouti are imported. Thus, the fall in oil prices would improve the current account. To stabilize domestic prices, the authorities had lowered the applicable taxes on fuel products, forgoing tax revenue. Staff estimates that at an international market oil price of US$87 a barrel, the need to lower the applicable taxes to maintain the current domestic administered price for diesel, the main fuel product, is eliminated. Thus, no fiscal revenue is forgone below this international price. However, as the base for fuel taxes in Djibouti is the international price of oil, declining international oil prices below the US$87 threshold would reduce fiscal revenues. The decline in international oil prices is not expected to have an immediate impact on inflation in Djibouti because prices of fuel products are administered. A lowering of these administered prices would result in a fall in the general price level, due to the large weight of fuel products in the CPI. Only US$22 million of the US$50 million intended for 2014 has been allocated to the 2014 budget because the full amount is not expected to arrive in time. The remaining US$28 million will be added evenly to the US$50 million intended for 2015–17. The final impact of a decline in international oil prices on fiscal revenues will depend on whether or not, and the extent to which, domestic administered prices are lowered. Staff estimates that any possible decline in fiscal revenues would be limited. T x L D j b u F Oil Price per Barrel (USD) Taxes Collected and Forgone on Diesel Collected Taxes Foregone taxes Maximum Revenue Page 11 Currency board coverage is being met. Currency board coverage is projected at 110 percent at end-2014, falling to 105 percent in 2015–19, compared with 107 percent in 2013. Central bank gross foreign assets should fall from US$411 million in 2013 to US$388 in 2014, as privatization revenues—kept at the central bank—are drawn down. Gross foreign assets are projected to increase by about 30 percent between 2015 and 2017, boosted by US$200 million in grants from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); and fall in 2018 and 2019, as government deposits at the central bank are drawn down. It is expected that currency board cover will not fall below the 105 percent floor set under the previous ECF. Under the currency board arrangement, the central bank is legally required to provide full cover for base money. Besides performing this basic function, the central bank normally does not intervene in the foreign exchange market. As a result, gross foreign reserves are largely delinked from the domestic foreign exchange market. External arrears have been accumulated. As of end-November 2014, the stock of external arrears (excluding technical arrears) stood at about US$4.7 million or about 0.3percent of GDP. The authorities have indicated that external and domestic arrears are being cleared. The financial sector remains stable but vulnerabilities persist. The central bank (BCD) made further progress in strengthening its overstretched banking supervision capacity, adopting new instructions on liquidity and the licensing of credit institutions. The banking sector is dominated by the two leading banks although their market share—currently 67 percent of assets—has been declining because of competition from the new banks. Eight of the 10 banks in operation, including the two leading banks, have now met the increased minimum capital requirement of one billion FD (US$5.6 million), following the expiration of the end-January 2014 deadline. Neither of the two banks that have failed to meet the minimum capital requirement is likely to pose systemic risks, given their low market share. Another bank, which had been in distress, is under receivership. This is also unlikely to pose systemic risk, because the bank’s market share is small. Nevertheless, nonperforming loans increased from 11.4 percent of total loans in 2012, to 16.2 percent at end- June 2014—which the authorities attribute to the introduction of stricter loan classification requirements. The nonperforming loan provisioning rate fell from 82 percent in 2012 to 60 percent in June 2014, and all the banks exceeded the single borrower limit as at end-June 2014.

Job Creation and Poverty Reduction A number of factors account for widespread poverty and unemployment in Djibouti. Investment has been narrowly concentrated. Although the current development model— which exploits Djibouti’s strategic location along one of the world’s busiest shipping routes—has transformed Djibouti into a vibrant service economy centered on port activities, it has fostered reliance on a single sector catering mainly to Ethiopia, leaving the economy vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, services—the main driver of growth in recent years—and construction activities account for only about 13 percent of formal employment. Much of the current investment boom is also narrowly concentrated on port and transportation services, reinforcing the need for reform to broaden the base and spread the benefits of growth (See Annex 1: Risk Assessment Matrix). The business environment has been challenging. Djibouti ranked 155th out of 189 countries on the World Bank’s Doing Business 2015 Index. The country ranked 171 or lower in getting electricity, getting credit, and enforcing contracts. These are major obstacles, especially for labor-intensive small businesses. On the control of corruption index of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, Djibouti’s percentile rank (out of 200 countries and territories) improved steadily to 51.5 in 2008 and then deteriorated to 41.6 in 2013. Djibouti’s demographics pose additional challenges. First, the low labor force participation rate, because of the low female participation rate, increases the dependence on the working population. Second, the population is relatively young—almost 75 percent is less than 35 years old—meaning a large proportion of the labor force are job market entrants who lack the experience (and skills) needed for employment. Youth unemployment standing at about 60 percent is much higher than the overall unemployment rate of 48 percent. Third, large-scale migration, exacerbated by refugees fleeing conflict in neighboring Somalia, is exerting additional pressure on basic social services and on the already tight job market. The domestic skills base is weak. More than a third of the labor force has no education; those with some education have been trained mainly for white-collar jobs, resulting in a significant skills mismatch. Financial inclusion remains low. Despite a relatively high bank deposit-to-GDP ratio of 80 percent, and private credit-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent, the bulk of the population and most small and medium size enterprises lack access to banking services. These are still concentrated on a few enterprises and individuals. Only about 14 percent of the adult population has a bank Page 16 account. Interest rate spreads are high, with the average deposit and lending rates at about 2 and 12 percent respectively. The high lending rate reflects banks risk aversion. Absent reliable credit and financial status information to support loan applications, banks impose a high lending rate or demand large collateral. Micro-finance remains underdeveloped. The Djibouti Savings and Credit Fund, the main micro-finance institution, has, since 2012, been under conservatorship by the central bank due to management problems. Figure 3.

Page 17 The authorities have articulated their overarching framework for addressing the country’s development challenges in Vision Djibouti 2035. Vision Djibouti 2035 envisions Djibouti as Africa’s commercial and logistics hub. It aims to triple per capita income, and reduce the unemployment rate from 48 percent to 10 percent, by 2035. The vision consists of five pillars: (i) peace and national unity, (ii) good governance, (iii) economic diversification, (iv) human capital development, and (v) regional integration. A rolling five-year Accelerated Growth Strategy for Promoting Employment (SCAPE) and a National Employment Policy 2014-19 have been developed to realize the vision. The employment policy emphasizes youth and female employment, and the development of small and medium enterprises. The authorities are pursuing several initiatives to improve electricity and water supply. High electricity costs and limited water supply are regarded as major constraints to investing in Djibouti. Electricity: Geothermal project, sponsored by a consortium of seven donors. The recruitment process for the consultant to oversee the project is underway. The project is expected to be completed in A second power interconnection with the Ethiopian electricity grid (which now supplies about 65 percent of Djibouti’s electricity consumption). A second thermal plant in Djibouti-ville, the capital city. Wind-generated electricity project: A joint venture is being considered. The first phase is expected to be completed in 2017. A solar project. To avoid possible duplication and inefficient use of scarce resources in these initiatives, the EU is undertaking a study to develop a strategic vision for the energy sector. Water supply: Two major initiatives are being launched. The first is the water pipeline that will be constructed between Djibouti and Ethiopia, permitting the importation of 100,000 cubic meters of water a day free of charge from Ethiopia (Annex 2 contains more details). The second initiative is a €45 million water desalination plant which will be built with a €40.5 million grant from the EU. The remaining €4.5 million will be provided by the Djibouti government or other donors. The project is expected to generate 45,000 cubic meters of water a day and to be completed in 2018. A number of poverty alleviation and social welfare initiatives have been launched. First, compulsory health insurance will be introduced for all government employees starting in 2015. The cost is being covered from the government budget and with additional funding from the African Development Bank. Health insurance will be extended subsequently to other beneficiaries. Second, the government has announced the construction of 5,000 social housing units. Third, connection Page 18 fees and consumption tariffs for water supplied by the state-owned water company have been lowered for poor neighborhoods. Fourth, a stone cutting project that employs 2,800 unskilled workers has been launched. Last, the authorities are developing a social register (database) to identify the poor and facilitate coordination of poverty alleviation initiatives. Rationalizing development initiatives and improving donor coordination. To ensure efficient resource allocation, development initiatives should be pursued within a well-defined global or sectoral strategy, especially in sectors with multiple initiatives such as electricity. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to improve coordination of donors and government institutions. Improving the business environment and competitiveness. Reducing red tape, stepping up anti-corruption efforts, and improving contract enforcement through administrative and judicial reforms should help create a more business friendly environment. Moreover, improving the supply of basic utilities and reducing the cost of electricity would boost competitiveness. Reform of educational curricula and training programs. The emphasis should be on ensuring that the labor force is trained for the needs of the job market, and that Djibouti nationals— rather than expatriates—take the jobs created during the investment boom. Economic diversification. Diversification is essential to exploit opportunities in sectors with high growth and employment potential such as tourism and fishing, and reduce the risks associated with relying on a single sector (services) catering mainly to one client (Ethiopia). To this end, improving the business climate is indispensable. Promoting financial inclusion and stability. Given the importance of financial stability for financial inclusion, staff stressed the need to strengthen banking supervision, reduce credit concentration, and monitor non-performing loans. Staff urged the authorities to increase the number of onsite bank inspections, focusing on internal risks and controls. Furthermore, staff reiterated the importance of strengthening the AML/CFT framework, particularly elements related to the financing of terrorism, the supervision of cross-border activities, and the detection of cross- border transportation of currency. Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to adopt the following measures to facilitate access to credit for individuals, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs): Accelerate the implementation of the national strategy for modernization of payments and credit reporting systems (project document has been completed with World Bank assistance). Set up a framework for mobile payments to make financial services accessible to low-income groups. Operationalize the SME Partial Credit Guarantee Fund (project study has been completed with World Bank assistance). Page 19 Diversify sources of SME financing by establishing an appropriate regulatory framework for specialized financial institutions such as leasing and Islamic financing institutions. (The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to improve the regulatory framework for Islamic banking.) Simplify the taxation system to encourage SMEs to migrate to the formal sector. Simplify access to land and improve mortgage procedures. Authorities’ views: The authorities generally concur with staff recommendations. They highlighted the various ongoing economic reforms and initiatives—aimed at improving water and electricity supply, providing safety nets for the poor, and providing improved training for the labor force—to reiterate their commitment to economic diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. They consider Vision Djibouti 2035 and its Accelerated Growth Strategy for Employment Creation as a well-defined overarching framework for development. They expect that the recently established committees will improve coordination and management of development initiatives. The authorities agree with staff that financial stability is critical for economic stability and growth in Djibouti, and that central bank supervisory capacity required further strengthening. While accepting that higher commercial bank provisioning requirements should be enforced, they perceive the deterioration of nonperforming loans as largely due to changes in classification procedures. B. Fiscal Sustainability The current fiscal stance appears unsustainable. The current fiscal stance is unlikely to generate the substantial revenues needed to service the growing public debt and to help translate the benefits of the investment boom into sustained and inclusive growth. The main elements of current fiscal policy are (i) generous tax exemptions for investors; (ii) tax exemption or low tax rates on fuel and basic food imports; and (iii) a hiring freeze in the public sector outside the education and health sectors (resulting in decline in the wage bill as a percentage of GDP). As a result of tax exemptions on investment, while the investment boom is expected to generate growth, the impact on revenues over the medium term would be modest, with the share of tax revenues to GDP declining and large budget deficits arising over the medium term. To ensure fiscal sustainability, reforms are required in public management, tax policy—especially the investment incentive framework—and debt management. Public management capacity is lagging behind investment spending. This is reflected in difficulties in effectively coordinating development projects, and the lack of appropriate appraisal for some projects. The institutional arrangement, including revenue sharing, for the joint railway project with Ethiopia—which is expected to be operational in 2015—has still not been finalized. Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to set up a committee to assess the macroeconomic implications of the mega investment projects and expects that the committee would provide much-needed information on the projects’ expected economic impact. Regarding public financial management, Page 20 the authorities informed staff that a resident expert provided by the US government has been working with staff of the Ministry of Budget to set up the medium-term budget framework which is expected to be operational in 2015. Lastly, the authorities informed staff that they have launched a public enterprise reform program covering ten enterprises including the water company (ONEAD) that will manage the water pipeline project, and the monopoly electricity provider (EDD). Investment risks loom large while contingent liabilities are expanding. Delays in implementing projects for which loans have been contracted would be costly to the budget. This holds for the delayed water pipeline project—the government would be obliged to service the loan, including the commitment fee of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed amount. Also, a rise in world interest rates would increase servicing costs for debt subject to variable interest rates. Meanwhile, the total amount of explicit public guarantees to the non-financial public sector is projected to increase from US$265 million (15 percent of GDP) in 2013 to over 60 percent of GDP over the next few years. This amount excludes debt contracted by public companies without explicit government guarantees and liabilities of public financial companies, which also represent implicit contingent liabilities to the government. With few exceptions, requests by public enterprises for government guarantees are approved even though the central government is unable to evaluate, monitor or manage the projects. Other risks linger. Political and security risks: Renewed political unrest could raise spending pressures, and undermine revenue collection efforts. Further terrorist attacks in Djibouti could delay or disrupt economic activity, particularly investment. Global recession. A recession in donor countries could result in reduced aid inflows. A global recession, leading to a decline in world trade and shipping, could reduce the use of Djibouti’s ports, and ultimately hurt government revenues. It could also undermine the ports’ ability to service the debt contracted to fund their ambitious investment program. Fiscal consolidation is imperative to: (i) reduce the large fiscal deficits, (ii) generate the resources required to service the growing public debt and create liquidity buffers, (iii) rationalize expenditure to create fiscal space to finance poverty alleviation initiatives, and (iv) reduce aid dependence. Over the medium term, in light of the authorities’ commitments, there is little scope for reducing investment expenditures, or for further tightening of current expenditures (dominated by wages) beyond the current freeze on public sector employment outside the education and health sectors. Consolidation would therefore have to focus on increasing revenues through fiscal reform, and reform of public enterprises to increase their profitability. Strengthen public management capacity. The timely execution of the investment projects, and, when operational, the capacity to generate revenues to meet their operating costs and service the associated loans are critical for fiscal sustainability. At present, the required public management Page 21 capacity is limited. Considering these constraints, staff recommended that the authorities: (i) undertake only economically viable investment projects, integrated in an overarching development framework to ensure consistency with Djibouti’s development objectives; (ii) prioritize the execution of the projects, taking into account absorptive capacity and resource constraints; and (iii) reform the public enterprises that will administer the mega investment projects to improve their efficiency and profitability. Staff stressed the importance of expediting the setting up of the institutional framework for managing the joint railway project with Ethiopia—including the revenue- sharing arrangement—before the railway becomes operational. In the area of public financial management, staff urged the authorities to: (i) implement the action plan for the medium-term budget framework to improve budget planning; and (ii) establish the treasury management system to ensure timely payment of government financial obligations and avoid accumulation of arrears. The authorities concurred with staff views and recommendations. Reform the investment incentive system. There is broad consensus that the investment incentive system creates an uneven playing field for investors, has been abused—some firms operating in the free zone are not engaged solely in export activities and others shift activity to the free zone to avoid paying taxes—and entails large fiscal costs. Thus, with current policies the fiscal benefits of the investment boom are likely to be modest, with the share of tax revenues in GDP projected to decline over the medium term. The authorities assured staff of their commitment to reform the investment incentive system towards greater transparency and efficiency, and that reform proposals would be deliberated at the proposed tax conference (paragraph 31). Other reforms to generate revenues. The authorities and private sector stakeholders pointed out that the tax base is narrow, comprising mainly firms not benefiting from fiscal exemptions and formal sector employees. Recognizing the need for reform, the authorities plan to organize in 2015 a tax conference ( Assisses Fiscales ) to deliberate reform proposals with various stakeholders. The reform proposals are yet to be developed. Meanwhile, the authorities and the private sector have set up a high-level Public-Private Partnership forum to discuss fiscal and other issues of common interest. The authorities informed staff that a new strategy has been developed for the monopoly telecommunications sector, with World Bank assistance. The strategy recommends opening up the mobile telephone market to a second operator. Staff would welcome this decision, as its implementation would generate fiscal revenues, and over time, help broaden the tax base. Last, the authorities stated that the legislation is being drafted to unify administration of the VAT and other taxes for large taxpayers, as recommended by an FAD technical assistance mission. The authorities indicated that a large taxpayers’ directorate—rather than a unit—is now planned. Policies to protect the poor and vulnerable population from high cost of living. In the wake of the global food price hikes of 2007-2008, the authorities removed import duties on five basic foodstuffs to help protect the welfare of the poor. They also acquired land in Ethiopia to cultivate crops and sell the products back in Djibouti at subsidized prices. Furthermore, to restrain domestic prices, the authorities introduced a negative tax adjustment to the existing taxes on Page 22 kerosene, gasoline and diesel. The negative tax adjustment lowers—but does not eliminate—net taxes collected on the products. The authorities informed staff that the fall in world fuel prices has obviated the need for this implicit subsidy on gasoline, and reduced the negative tax adjustment on diesel and kerosene. Nevertheless, this could be reversed by a rise in world prices. In line with past staff advice, the authorities reiterated their commitment to eliminate the negative tax adjustment mechanism, and set up a safety net program to protect the poor from any ensuing price increases. They stated that they have developed a timetable for the removal of fuel subsidies and are awaiting the preparation of the social register to set up the safety net program, which would involve cash transfers. Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledge the scale of the fiscal challenges facing the economy and concur with staff that reform is indispensable to help address them. Their reform plans are based on the following pillars. First is reform of public enterprises and the budget framework. They have launched a public enterprise reform program to improve the performance of key enterprises including the enterprise that will manage the water pipeline project. They are also working towards implementing the medium-term budget framework by 2015. The authorities recognize their limited capacity in public management at present, and underscore the importance of technical assistance to enhance it. Second is tax reform. The authorities share staff concerns about the limitations of the tax regime, especially the investment incentive framework. They expect the fiscal conference planned for 2015 to generate concrete reform recommendations that would pave the way for a more efficient and transparent regime. Third is subsidy reform. The authorities remain committed to reforming the fuel subsidy system and intend to put in place social safety nets to protect the poor. Last is the need to restrain spending. Given their commitment to their investment strategy, the authorities plan to maintain the hiring freeze in the public sector outside the education and health sectors. C. Deb Sustainability and External Stability Debt vulnerabilities have increased significantly over the past two years. In 2013–14, the public sector contracted US$1 billion (70 percent of 2013 GDP) in external loans. This included the two non-concessional loans signed by the central government to finance the railway and water pipeline projects, which are to be disbursed over 2014-2019. As a result, total public and publicly guaranteed debt is expected to exceed 80 percent of GDP in 2017 (see the DSA annex). The updated DSA indicates elevated solvency risks as well as potential near-term liquidity tightness. There are significant and protracted breaches of the present values of the debt- to-GDP and debt-to-exports thresholds. Liquidity ratios breach nearly all the thresholds. External debt ratios are most sensitive to exchange rate depreciation (which is unlikely under the currency board arrangement), and shocks to exports and tightening of the financing terms (some loans have An FAD technical assistance mission estimated the forgone revenues due to the negative tax adjustment at about 2 percent of GDP for 2012. Page 23 floating interest rates). Djibouti remains at a high risk of external debt distress. Given the significant share of debt with floating rates, the central government budget is sensitive to potential tightening of global liquidity. At current US LIBOR rates of about 0.5 percent, the interest rate bill is projected to reach 1.1-1.6 percent of GDP in 2015-2019. To date, no provision has been made for liquidity buffers. Debt service capacity is not mainstreamed into the budget planning process, and is undermined also by limited coordination among relevant agencies. The absence of liquidity management leads to repeated arrears accumulation. Responsibility for financial planning, monitoring, and negotiation is spread between the external debt directorate in the Ministry of Budget, the external financing directorate in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and other units in the two ministries, with some overlap in functions and no clear lines of subordination. The absence of a medium-term strategy and limited coordination among public finance institutions undermine transparency and effective debt monitoring. Central bank involvement in debt management is crucial, given the risks to external stability caused by excessive borrowing. Develop a strategy to reduce and manage the external debt burden. Any public or publicly guaranteed borrowing on non-concessional terms would lead to additional debt service costs over the medium term and should be avoided. In addition, any new debt-financed investment should be based on a rigorous assessment of near-term financing costs and potential medium-term benefits. The assessment of debt service capacity and debt sustainability should be integrated into investment management and budget planning. The budget should provide for sufficient liquidity buffers to cover volatile debt service costs and avoid accumulating arrears. Last, alternative options for promoting investment other than direct government debt-financed participation should be considered, noting the risks involved in public-private partnerships in particular. Strengthen coordination among government units involved in debt management and monitoring. Expedite the setting up of the Debt Committee consisting of the ministry of budget, the ministry of economy and finance, and the central bank. Tighten monitoring of government contingent liabilities by: (i) developing rules for issuing government guarantees; and (ii) introducing a monitoring system for debt incurred by public companies without government guarantees. Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledge the risks attached to their current financing strategy. However, they believe this strategy would be viable if it could generate growth and attract large FDI inflows. They stated that external and domestic arrears are being cleared and that, to improve debt management, they are considering setting up a debt committee comprising the ministry of budget, the ministry of economy and finance, and the central bank. The authorities The September 2013 Medium-Term Debt Strategy TA mission echoed this observation. Page 24 underlined the importance of government guarantees as they reduce public enterprises’ financing costs. STAFF APPRAISAL The authorities are fully committed to their investment strategy, despite the concomitant increase in fiscal and external debt vulnerabilities. They view the strategy as vital for the country’s development in the face of widespread poverty and unemployment and the absence of natural resources and a viable agricultural sector. Fiscal as well as structural reforms are essential to generate the high economic growth and substantial revenues needed to return the economy to a sustainable fiscal and external debt path and realize the benefits of the investment boom. While the scaling up of investment is expected to generate growth, its medium-term impact on revenues is likely to be modest due to weaknesses in the fiscal regime and in public management. Accordingly, a wide range of reforms is required to enhance the capacity of the central government and public enterprises to raise the revenues needed to return the economy to a path of fiscal and external debt sustainability. At the same time, deep structural reforms are needed to ensure that growth reduces poverty and unemployment and generates widespread benefits. Improving public capacity to manage investment projects is key. Enhancing public management capacity will help ensure that only viable investment projects are undertaken based on absorptive capacity and resource availability. Public enterprises charged with managing investment projects should be reformed to improve their capacity for the task. The institutional arrangement for managing the joint railway project with Ethiopia should be finalized before the railway becomes operational. Improved coordination of the various ongoing initiatives, especially in the electricity sector, would help avoid duplication. Staff welcomes the setting up of a committee to assess the macroeconomic implications of investment projects as a step to fill the gaps in analyzing the impact of the investment projects. Implementing the medium-term budget framework would improve budget planning. A debt management strategy is needed. The strategy should seek to manage and reduce the external debt burden, avoid any public and publicly guaranteed debt that could lead to additional debt service costs over the medium term, and integrate assessment of debt service capacity and debt sustainability into the budget process. Coordination among government units involved in contracting, monitoring, and servicing debt should also be improved. The authorities should remain current on Djibouti’s existing obligations. Clearance of existing arrears should be incorporated into the budget. The budget should provide for sufficient liquidity buffers to cover volatile debt service costs and avoid accumulating arrears. The investment incentive system and overall fiscal framework should be revamped. Staff recommends a review of the investment incentive system, in light of the widespread perception that it has not yielded the desired outcomes while generating large fiscal costs. Staff urges the Page 25 authorities to proceed with the fiscal conference which should provide a forum to examine reform possibilities for the incentive system in particular, and the fiscal framework as a whole, and introduce the reforms needed for fiscal sustainability and growth. Fiscal consolidation is indispensable. The current levels of fiscal deficits cannot be sustained. However, the scope for further expenditure cuts is limited given the tightening of current expenditures already envisaged. This unsustainable situation highlights the urgency of fiscal reform to broaden the tax base and reduce leakages. Over the next few years, it is also important for the investment projects to begin to generate revenues, and thus help cut the deficits. Economic diversification remains a priority. Much of the scaling up of investment is focused on port and transportation infrastructure catering mainly to Ethiopia, reinforcing the risk associated with reliance on a single sector with one client. Structural reforms aimed at economic diversification towards sectors with high growth and employment potential would help reduce this risk. The key priorities are: (i) reducing the high electricity costs which—despite the importation since 2011 of much cheaper electricity from Ethiopia—have not been reduced for businesses; (ii) improving the business environment, especially through strengthening the protection of property rights and contract enforcement, and reducing red tape. Educational curricula and training programs require reform with an emphasis on skills training, rather than academic training. This would help to develop the skills that are in demand in the job market, thereby improving the ability of Djibouti nationals to fill the jobs created during the investment boom. Strengthening bank supervision is critical for financial stability. Further strengthening of central bank supervisory capacity is needed to deal with the expanding banking sector. Enhanced banking supervision would enable the central bank to improve monitoring the quality of commercial bank lending, enforce higher provisioning requirements for such loans, and encourage commercial banks to improve their risk management capacity. Facilitating access to credit for individuals and labor-intensive micro, small and medium enterprises would help foster inclusive growth. Strengthening banking supervision will foster financial stability. Developing the overall financial infrastructure by modernizing the payments and credit reporting systems, and providing partial credit guarantees for small and medium enterprises, would promote access to financial services and contribute to inclusive growth. Targeted social safety nets are needed to protect the poor and vulnerable population from economic hardship. Poverty alleviation policies have been largely untargeted, with limited impact on intended beneficiaries despite the high incidence of poverty. Staff welcomes the ongoing preparation of the social register that will provide the database for developing safety net programs and urges the authorities to expedite the process. Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12- month cycle. Page 26 Table 1.

Major Medium-Term Central Government Investment Projects The government plans to spend about US$900 million (60 percent of GDP) on two large investment projects in 2014-2018. The railway project The electrified railway project involves the construction of a 756 km railway line, stretching from Addis-Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. The Djibouti segment of the railway line costs US$550 million, and the loan contracted is about US$492 million. Ethiopia is financing its own segment of the railway line. The Djibouti government will provide the remaining US$58 million, of which US$28.5 million had already been provided in 2013 from the privatization revenues. Construction of the Djibouti segment is already underway without well-defined institutional arrangements for managing the project. The Djibouti authorities expect that the project will generate the following benefits: (i) reduced travel time, (ii) job creation, and (iii) revenue generation through increased port traffic. Furthermore, they anticipate that the railway line will transform Djibouti into the main port for landlocked South Sudan’s imports and oil exports via Ethiopia. Staff believes that the railway project is likely to generate economic growth, jobs, and, in the long- run, fiscal revenues for Djibouti if it is implemented and managed within a well-defined institutional arrangement for revenue sharing with Ethiopia. Such an arrangement is yet to be put in place. Furthermore, staff does not have the necessary data to quantify the possible positive macroeconomic impact and assess whether the expected benefits are sufficiently large to justify the project cost. The water pipeline projects The project involves the construction of a pipeline between Djibouti and Ethiopia to permit the importation of 100,000 cubic meters of water a day free of charge from Ethiopia. The total cost of the project is US$340 million of which about US$322 million is a loan from China. The Djibouti government will provide the additional financing (US$18 million). The current daily demand for water in Djibouti-ville, the capital city, which is home to about 60 percent of the national population, is estimated at 80,000 cubic meters a day. Information on the demand for the entire country is unavailable. The current supply of water is estimated at 36,000 cubic meters a day. Much of the current supply comes from underground sources which are of poor quality and are being depleted. Water from other sources suitable for domestic use is virtually nonexistent. The daily demand is projected at 114,500 cubic meters in 2020 and 144,000 cubic meters in 2030. An estimated 50 percent of water supply is lost due to the dilapidated state of the distribution network. A long- delayed €46 million Euros desalination project is expected to be initiated in 2014 and completed by end-2016. Page 35 Staff believes that the water pipeline will generate large social benefits by reducing or eliminating the shortfall in the demand for water which has been a potential source of political unrest. The pipeline could also induce investment that has been deterred by insufficient water supply. However, it is unlikely that the revenues generated directly from the project will cover the related debt service obligations unless certain politically difficult decisions are taken, notably water tariff increases, and requiring non-state actors—especially foreign military bases located in the country—to source water from Djibouti’s state-owned water company instead of generating their own water supply. Furthermore, the terms and institutional arrangements for accessing the water reserve will need to be clarified with Ethiopia. Lastly, the state-owned water company that will take over the operation of the pipeline and the servicing of the loan requires restructuring. Page 36 Annex III. External Sector Assessment and Competitiveness The current account deficit is forecast to remain large over the medium term reflecting sharp increase in capital imports. However, most of investment imports are linked to external project loans or direct investment flows and may not be realized if disbursements are delayed. Taking into account this financing, real effective exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued. Going forward, the current account could narrow due to increased exports capacity without major adjustment of the REER. In order to mitigate significant external vulnerabilities, the government should continue reforms targeted at improving business environment, promote exports diversification and reduction domestic costs. It is also important to build sufficient buffers of foreign exchange reserve. The current account gap will exceed 27 percent of GDP in the near term, but is projected to fall back to low double-digits after the construction boom is over. Massive capital goods imports will greatly exceed an expected increase in export revenues (mainly port services) over 2014–17. In the medium term, the on-going expansion of the port infrastructure and related transportation is expected to result in major increase in exports potential as well as to allow Djibouti to benefit from growth of Ethiopia’s economy and external trade. Exports of maritime services is forecast to accelerate to about 15 percent in real terms on average in 2014-2019 as construction of new port facilities will allow to ease capacity constraints. Constructions of the new railroad will generate a new stream of export revenues, however for the next decade most of the incomes will be used to cover debt service. Limited exports diversification and minimal local production makes the outlook dependent on the economic performance of the neighboring Ethiopia and the global commodity prices. While export revenues are concentrated in trade and transportation services, local production of key consumption goods (such as food) as well as the main factors of production (including water and energy) is almost non-existent. Current account remains prone to food prices and energy shocks. Public borrowings, predominantly project loans, remain the main source of financing. Most of the investment projects are either directly financed by the government, or by public enterprises under the explicit government guarantee. Due to limited investment opportunities and underdeveloped financial system within the country, banks prefer to accumulate assets abroad or transfer them to the parent companies, draining capital from Djibouti.

Page 37 by nonfinancial enterprises is limited. Overall, the threat of sudden stops in capital flows is perceived to be low. Major improvement in competitiveness and business environment in particular, are prerequisites for the projected increase in FDI flows. To unlock private investments and benefit fully from its main competitive advantage—geographical position—Djibouti needs to realize major improvements in business environment, increase labor efficiency and reduce costs of other factors of production such as energy. Despite recent steps made by the government to facilitate start of new businesses and access to financing, Djibouti remains behind its peers (See paragraph 13- Djibouti: Business environment and Governance Indicators). Accounting for the structure of external financing and the drivers of external demand, the real effective exchange rate (REER) is assessed to be moderately overvalued. In 2013, the REER index based on consumer price inflation remained broadly unchanged (figure above) as compared to the previous year. At the same time, as current account remains above the level consistent with the medium-term fundamentals (estimated at around 7 percent), quantitative models provide a range of 15-60 percent for the estimates of the REER gap. Taking into account data constraints, the results should be treated with particular caution for a few reasons: Most capital goods imports are directly financed through accumulation of public and publicly-guaranteed debt or FDI inflows. Net of imports associated with the major on-going and projected investments, estimated gaps would be much lower. This is not captured in MB or EBA estimates. Price elasticity of exports and imports is very low. Demand for Djibouti’s main exports—port services and the use of its land for military bases—stems from Djibouti’s geo-strategic location. At the same time, internal production of the main import items such as food and manufactured goods is non-existent due to unfavorable climate and a range of other of supply-side constraints. Djibouti remains dependent on aid flows, which should be captured in the assessment of the gaps. Current account projections are highly sensitive to the assumptions on loan disbursements. As discussed above, after the frontloaded scale-up in investments, the current account is projected to fall to about 13 percent by 2019 and further to about 10 percent in the long term without major movements in the REER. Sufficient reserves buffers are needed to deal with shocks. Under the baseline, reserves coverage ratio will stay at around 105 percent of the sum of the broad money and the government deposit at the central bank, which is slightly above legally required full coverage. Reserves imports coverage ratio is projected to fluctuate between 3 and 5 months of imports below the 6 months benchmark for countries with fixed exchange rate regime.
