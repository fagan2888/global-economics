High and rising government spending has been at the core of France’s fiscal problems (Selected Issues Chapter I). After more than two decades of steady growth, general government expenditures reached a record high in 2014, at over 57½ percent of GDP—about 12 percentage points above the average of the other euro area countries. This growth was driven primarily by social security and local government spending, which expanded on average one percentage point per year faster than GDP, while the central government spending has been growing on par with GDP. As a result of the persistent spending pressures, revenues had to be raised successively, and France’s tax burden is now about ten percentage points of GDP above the euro area average, constraining the growth potential of the private sector (Figure 6). Moreover, with a persistent structural deficit, public debt has ballooned to 95½ percent of GDP in 2014, from 21 percent of GDP in 1980. Page 15 The fiscal strategy has rightly shifted to expenditure-based consolidation, but the planned pace of adjustment leaves little room for maneuver. Reliance on nominal containment measures—such as public service wage-scale freezes and temporary under-indexation of pensions and certain social benefits—did not deliver the adjustment envisaged in last year’s Stability Program, as growth and inflation came in below projections. In light of these slippages, the European Council granted France two additional years, until 2017, to bring its headline deficit below the EDP threshold, allowing for a more gradual adjustment path. The fiscal strategy outlined in this year’s Stability Program, which includes additional spending reductions of 0.2 percent of GDP for both 2015 and 2016, would bring the headline deficit narrowly below 3 percent of GDP in 2017 under baseline assumptions. While the 2015 deficit objective appears on track to be met, there is a risk that medium-term targets will be missed in the event that growth or inflation fall short, or additional spending needs arise. Fiscal Adjustment Sources: France authorities, IMF staff calculations. Staff recommended keeping spending flat in real terms, starting with the 2016 budget. A fiscal anchor that ensures that primary general government expenditure grows in line with inflation, supported by a burden sharing mechanism, would deliver structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP per year, striking an appropriate balance between anchoring debt sustainability and smoothing the impact on demand. It would provide a safety margin to ensure that the headline deficit is reduced to below 3 percent of GDP by 2017 and debt is placed on a firm downward trajectory. It would also help ensure that structural fiscal balance is achieved within the next five years, which would create fiscal space for tax alleviation in the order of ½ percent of GDP per year starting around 2020. To this end, staff recommended clarifying the structural measures underpinning the already announced spending package and identifying additional savings. In the short term, this could include further tightening the budget constraint for local governments, steps Nominal spending growth was contained at 1.6 percent in 2014 (almost half of which was due to rising tax credits). With nominal GDP growth coming in at only 0.8 percent, this resulted in a further rise of the spending-GDP ratio. Similarly, with a lower-than-projected nominal GDP path in 2015 and beyond, both spending and headline deficits are projected to exceed the targets set in early 2014 (see text chart).

Any windfall gains from potential interest savings or excess revenues should be saved. Alternative Fiscal Adjustment Path (In percent of GDP / potential GDP) Fiscal adjustment should rely on deeper reforms that can underpin a lasting reduction in government spending (Selected Issues Chapter I). Building on recent efforts, regular broad- based expenditure reviews should be employed to assess the efficiency and quality of expenditure at all levels of government and prepare for deeper structural reforms, including: Streamlining local government positions and institutions, supported by further cuts in transfers, tighter caps on local borrowing and taxes, and elimination of the universal competency clause that allows local governments to spend in all areas; Reversing the growth in public employment based on reviews of staffing at all levels of government; Improving the targeting and efficiency of social benefits, including for unemployment, welfare, families, and housing allowances; and Reforming pension benefits, by raising the effective retirement age, streamlining special pension regimes, and ensuring the financial sustainability of supplementary pensions. The authorities confirmed that fiscal consolidation will be fully expenditure-based going forward, and emphasized the spending containment efforts since last year. On the pace of adjustment, they considered that the multi-year strategy outlined in this year’s Stability Program provides adequate margins to meet medium-term targets, in particular as 2014201520162017201820192020Fiscal balance-4.0-3.8-3.4-2.8-2.1-1.3-0.7Structural fiscal balance-2.4-2.2-2.0-1.8-1.5-1.1-0.7Expenditure57.557.156.555.855.154.353.7Gross debt95.697.398.298.297.395.593.0Fiscal balance-4.0-3.8-3.2-2.5-1.7-0.8-0.3 Structural fiscal balance-2.4-2.2-1.8-1.4-0.8-0.10.0Expenditure57.557.156.355.554.753.852.8Gross debt95.697.398.298.196.994.791.8Cumulative nominal spending reduction0.00.0-0.4-0.8-1.2-1.7-2.2(in percent of baseline spending)Cumulative impact on nominal GDP0.00.0-0.2-0.3-0.5-0.6-0.5(in percent of baseline GDP) Staff baselineZero real primary spending growth 2016-20 Memorandum items: Page 17 macroeconomic assumptions are prudent. They confirmed that any windfall would be used to reduce debt. The authorities concurred with staff on the need to reduce the expenditure-to-GDP ratio, ultimately bringing it closer to the euro area average. They agreed on the need for structural reforms to contain local spending, control the wage bill, and improve the targeting of social security programs. While horizontal nominal spending measures remain necessary in the near term, the 2016 budget will also include structural measures. The authorities noted that containing spending at the local level is challenging given the constitutionally guaranteed fiscal autonomy of sub-national governments, but progressive cuts in transfers from the state combined with the recent creation of an indicative spending target ( ODEDEL ) should help.
