Overvaluation of the official exchange rate was broadly eliminated with the exchange rate liberalization in December 2015. Given the resistance from vested interests, this was a courageous and crucial step in the right direction that broadly eliminated a large overvaluation of the official rate and reduced the spread to the parallel market. However, given the current economic and political uncertainties, the volatility in the parallel market remains high and the cash premium has risen substantially. This has caused the spread to the official indicative rate to increase substantially since mid-2016. With the current low inflow of foreign exchange, the BSS should continue to conduct regular auctions with smaller amounts to send price signals to the market. The authorities will need to ensure that the spread between the official and parallel rates is reduced by allowing the auction and indicative rates to reflect market conditions. Restoration of external stability will require improvement in policies and external support (Annex I). While exchange rate flexibility will help, tighter fiscal and monetary policies combined with some external financing are required to restore external stability and to gradually rebuild reserves. In particular, urgent measures are needed to minimize foreign exchange expenditure by the government in light of the current very weak reserve position. The tighter fiscal conditions should over time allow the BSS to increase reserves. Over the medium term, structural reforms to address business environment will be essential to diversify the economy and build competitiveness. Page 18 MEDIUM TERM: REBUILDING BUFFERS AND
