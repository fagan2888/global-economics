The consultation focused on evaluating policies to counter risks to the UK economy and secure durable and robust growth. The acceleration in growth is welcome but needs to be sustained. In this respect, staff assessed the balance of the recovery and risks posed by ongoing productivity concerns, the housing market, and external factors. Policy discussions devoted particular attention to the normalization of monetary policy, measures needed to address financial stability risks and ensure a vibrant, but safe financial sector, the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment, and steps to boost housing supply and long-run potential growth. Economic policy has been broadly in line with past Fund advice. Consistent with Fund recommendations in the 2013 Article IV consultations, the Bank of England has continued to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth. Repair of bank balance sheets has progressed, and the authorities have elaborated a strategy for the two state-owned banks, aimed at returning them to good health and eventually to private ownership. The Bank of England has also outlined a framework for stress-testing bank soundness. The government has also boosted capital spending, within the confines of the well-elaborated medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy, to boost the economyâ€™s long-term potential.
