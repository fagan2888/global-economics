Context H After the end of its civil war in 2002, Sierra Leone experienced more than a decade of strong economic performance, building on improved policies and high commodity prices, which allowed a sharp expansion of iron ore mining Between 2003 and 2014, the economy grew an average of 8 percent per year, while inflation fell below 10 percent (Text Figure 1). The country was making social progress as well; the poverty head count had dropped from nearly 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent, and its Human Development Index (HDI) ranking improved modestly. A combination of improved macroeconomic policies, targeted social measures, the discovery of iron ore, and a favorable external environment were major factors underlying this success. 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 x New Cases in Sierra Leone (Weekly basis, May 2014 August 2015) Text Figure 2. The Spread of Ebola: Number of In 2014, however, the economy was hit by twin shocks — an outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and a sharp drop in iron ore prices As the EVD spread (Text Figure 2), private sector activity came to a halt as businesses closed, and movement of goods and people was restricted. There were sharp job losses in the private sector, while agricultural exports and manufacturing output declined 30 and 60 percent, respectively (SIP 1). As the government was trying to generate additional resources to fight the EVD, iron ore production came to a halt in early 2015, largely as a result of the sharp drop in iron ore prices (Text Figure 3). GDP fell more than 21 percent while domestic revenue as a percentage of non-iron ore GDP dropped to 10.5 (end-2015) from 12.6 (end-2013) prior to the “National Ebola Recovery Strategy for Sierra Leone, 2015– ” prepared by Government of Sierra Leone. Page 13 shocks. Banking sector vulnerabilities also increased, in part due to the pressures created by Ebola and the iron ore crisis. Text Figure 3. Iron Ore Production iron ore, total volume (tons '000), LHS iron ore, unit price (USD per ton), RHS The authorities have done a commendable job in dealing with these two crises, with the support of the international community . The Fund has helped through a combination of debt relief, increased financing and budget on-lending, the IMF provided over US$219 million in assistance during 15 (about 5 percent of 2015 GDP), significantly above what had previously been planned. This helped alleviate the impact of the twin shocks on both the balance of payments (BOP) and the budget. The authorities made adjustments internally, focusing the budget on EVD response, economic recovery, and poverty reduction. Program performance suffered initially, but regained traction in 2015. Source: Sierra Leone authorities. Although still undergoing adjustment, the economy is showing signs of recovery Sierra Leone was declared Ebola free for a second time on March 17, 2016. This has contributed to the resumption of economic activity and a pickup in revenues. The authorities, in partnership with the international community, designed and began implementing a post-Ebola Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). The plan has three main elements: getting to and staying at zero new EVD cases; implementing immediate recovery priorities through social measures, education and sanitation; and transitioning back to the Agenda for Prosperity Plan (A4P) in the medium term (MEFP ¶3). The 2016 Article IV discussions were conducted together with the fifth review under the ECF in March 2016, and continued during the Spring Meetings . The Article IV consultation focused on critical medium-term (including 2017) issues, while the fifth review focused on immediate and short-term challenges. B. Recent Economic Developments, Medium-Term Outlook and Risks As a result of the twin shocks, Sierra Leone’s economy in 2015 deteriorated severely Growth is estimated to have declined from 4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.1 percent in 2015. Between mid-2014 and end-2015, the Leone depreciated 22 percent against the US dollar. Despite the loss of iron ore exports and the resultant more than 55 percent decline in total exports, the current account (CA) deficit improved from 20.1 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2014 to about 15.5 percent in 2015. This was driven by a more than 20 percent decline in imports — largely Ebola related imports of Country Report No. 15/323 elaborates more extensively on the macroeconomic impact of the twin shocks. Page 14 goods and services and fuel products — and still strong current transfers related to Ebola. In early 2016, the largest iron ore producer resumed operations, albeit at significant loss. On the fiscal front, the deficit further widened to 4.4 percent in 2015 from 4.0 percent of GDP in 2014 . Domestic revenue in percent of GDP declined to 10.5 percent in 2015 from 10.8 percent in 2014, mainly due to the loss of revenue from minerals and the ongoing impact of Ebola. This was a somewhat better performance than anticipated at the time of the last review, as revenue was nearly 0.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP, due to enhanced tax audits, minimization of duty concessions, and stricter enforcement. Staff and authorities estimate that about half, of the over-performance in revenue was from structural measures in better administration that could be sustained going forward, while the rest was from one-time measures. Expenditures were broadly in line with expectations, about 0.1 percent of non-iron ore GDP higher than targeted. Combined, the fiscal deficit in 2015 widened moderately. However, revenue shortfalls led to periodic accumulations of arrears, which in turn contributed to problems in the financial sector, discussed below. Inflation remained contained in 2015, despite significant exchange rate depreciation Consumer price inflation averaged X illi un percent in 2015, slightly below staff’s projection during the last review, compared with 8.3 percent in 2014. The increase in inflation reflected exchange rate depreciation, reduced food supply due to lower agriculture production, and disruptions in cross border trade with Liberia and Guinea. du X ff H ff Monetary policy management during ) the second half of 2015 was challenged by the depreciation, increased inflation expectations driven mainly by non-food inflation and the pass through effect associated with the depreciation of the leone. With the end of Ebola and related decreases in external financing, the Leone depreciated 18 percent against the dollar between mid-2015 and end- March 2016 (Text Figures 4 and 5), as donor inflows continue to decline and iron ore export FS W nd ff H pu Z In spite of repeated requests, staff has not received adequate information to assess accurately the breakeven price. Based on limited information, staff roughly estimates the break-even iron ore price for the mine is currently around $75 per ton. Sierra Leone has no external arrears, except the legacy arrears dating back to the civil war period. Page 15 receipts remained negligible. Interventions in the foreign exchange market by the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL, central bank of Sierra Leone) increased markedly between the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, reaching US$19 million in December 2014. In the second half of 2015 and early 2016, BSL reduced interventions to about $3 4 million per week and since the second week of February 2016, the BSL has intervened only infrequently, to preserve reserves. The reserve coverage remains adequate at 3.8 months of imports at end-2015 (Annex I). This is higher than both the standard 3-month norm and the suggested level by the LIC reserve template, at 2.8 months of imports. The REER is estimated to be overvalued between 12 14 percent as of December 2015, suggesting continued pressure on the exchange rate. This will help reduce the current account deficit, particularly through reduced imports , as Sierra Leone’s exports are less responsive to exchange rate. The financial sector is in distress . At end-2015, there were significant problems with respect to prudential norms. Compared to 2014, the number of banks that were non-compliant with the minimum liquidity, capital adequacy, and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios increased. Partly caused by the twin shocks, the NPL ratio jumped from 22 percent at end 2013 to 38 percent in mid-2015. Poor loan quality reflects continuing fragility in the private sector, problems in banking supervision, and governance and connected lending issues in the two majority state-owned banks. Loan sector concentration remains high with international trade, construction, and services accounting for about three quarters of total loans. The top five borrowers account for 35 percent of total gross loans. The economic environment in 2016 remains very challenging . Iron ore production by the largest mining company (Shanghai Iron and Steel Group, SISG) has resumed, providing a modest impetus to real GDP. However, given the low international iron ore price and the significant discount at which SISG’s iron ore is sold on the international market, its contribution to nominal GDP will be marginal. The economic recovery in the near term will largely from non-iron ore and agriculture sectors as the authorities’ economic diversification ef fort and post Ebola recovery plan. Overall, staff projects a return of economic growth in 2016, with total real GDP projected to increase by 4.3 percent, with non-iron ore GDP increasing by 3.3 percent. Average inflation is projected to edge up slightly to 9.5 percent, driven by further exchange rate depreciation, offset somewhat by improvements in domestic food production. Though the NPL ratio declined to around 32 percent at end 2015, the amounts of outstanding loans and provisions were largely unchanged. This may indicate that at least part of the decline in NPLs was achieved through issuance of new loans to pay off overdue loans. Discussion is also on-going for a second mining company to resume production as soon as agreement can be reached on a repayment schedule for tax arrears. Staff has not incorporated this into the medium-term projection given the uncertainty. Given the uncertainties in the sector, staff agreed with the authorities to base 2016 and 2017 macroeconomic projections on assumed iron ore exports that are roughly half the level SISG projects. Page 16 The 2016 fiscal environment is even more challenging than in 2015 , despite the fact that domestic revenues are increasing 0.4 percent of GDP from last year. This increase in revenues is mainly due to policy measures discussed in more detail below, and comes despite the fact that the authorities failed to adhere to their commitment, in the context of the last review, to eliminate implicit fuel subsidies. The approved budget accounted for the fact that budget support is declining by more than 1 percent of GDP from 2015. However, it has proven challenging to mobilize the domestic financing assumed in the budget (3 percent of GDP), despite very significant increases in interest rates on treasury obligations, as continued BSL sales of foreign exchange have drained liquidity from the system. Combined with some overspending — particularly on wages — and the failure to eliminate fuel subsidies as committed in the last review, the budget faces a financing gap for 2016 of more than 1 percent of GDP. Staff and the authorities agreed on measures to close these gaps, as discussed below and in the MEFP (¶22 25). Monetary policy is expected to focus on price stability, while liquidity management should be enhanced The overly tight liquidity in early 2016 calls for improvement in BSL’s liquidity management, as well as a halt to BSL foreign exchange sales. The BSL is struggling to balance the need to provide adequate liquidity to enable the effective operation of commercial banks and to avoid an overshooting of interest rates, with the desire to fight further leone depreciation. The current account (CA) deficit is projected to deteriorate modestly With the resumption of iron ore production in early 2016, exports are projected to rise by 13.7 percent, to $662 million. The trade deficit is projected to improve to US$669 million, helped by resumption of iron ore exports and declining oil prices. However, the CA deficit is projected to increase slightly to over 16 percent of GDP due to declining current transfers, and will be predominantly financed by FDI-related inflows. A significant boost to FDI is expected to come from investments in the agriculture and food processing sectors, as well as predicted capital flows from the parent company to cover the incurred losses of the iron ore company. Over the medium term, economic prospects are expected to improve given that the twin shocks have now largely wound down . Staff projects medium-term growth gradually picking up to around 6.5 percent in 2020 from 4.3 percent in 2016. Inflation will decline to 7.5 percent in 2020 from 9.5 percent in 2016. The fiscal and current accounts deficits will decline to 3.3 and 15 percent in 2020 from 4.9 and 16.6 percent in 2016, respectively. The projected deterioration in the current account deficit from 2017 onwards is mostly driven by the need to increase reserves, as well as by the projected cessation of World Bank budget support. As a result, a balance of payments financing gap is projected to emerge in the medium term. The unusual situation in the iron ore sector makes the medium-term projections highly uncertain . As noted above, staff does not have sufficient data to firmly determine the cost of iron ore production, but it is clear the current mine is operating at a loss. Since it is unclear why SISG chose to resume production at a loss, it is hard for staff to forecast the likelihood of continued Liquidity here refers to excess cash in commercial bank to purchase Treasury Bills. From a prudential perspective, where liquidity includes the stock of Treasury Bills holdings, there is ample liquidity in the system. Page 17 production, or the realistic prospects for the proposed resumption of production at the second mine. Given these uncertainties, staff has attempted to assess what the first-round impacts on the economy would be if iron ore production halted again If there were zero iron ore production in 2017 and 2018, growth would decline to an estimated 1.8 and 5.0 percent, respectively (compared to 5.0 and 5.8 percent in the baseline). The direct fiscal impact would be surprisingly limited, as the mine currently only pays royalties. Thus, the estimated loss of fiscal revenue would be around 0.2 percent of GDP per year. The loss of iron ore exports would be partially offset by declining iron ore related imports, but nonetheless the current account would deteriorate by $75 100 million per year; closing this gap would be perhaps the biggest challenge from a loss of iron ore exports. The risks to outlook are firmly to the downside Beyond the risks related to iron ore production, projected FDI flows may fail to materialize, particularly, in the medium term, posing significant downside risk to both the DSA and the balance of payments financing, as this would cause both growth and exports to be lower. In addition, if the high NPL problem and weaknesses in the state-owned banks are not tackled rapidly, the weaker exchange rate and higher inflation combined with low growth could further compromise the overall stability of the banking system and result in potential high fiscal costs for possible bank recapitalizations and/or resolution. Other domestic risks which could pose negative impacts on outlook include poor implementation of fiscal policy or reemergence of Ebola. External risks include persistently lower energy prices and structural weak growth in emerging economies, particularly a further slowdown in China. These risks emphasize the importance of domestic revenue mobilization and expenditure prioritization. On the monetary and financial policy front, they underline the urgency of timely implementation of the recommendations of the diagnostic studies of the two banks. Authorities’ Views The authorities broadly concur with staff’s projections The authorities agreed with staff’s views on growth and inflation prospects for the medium term, which are better than assumed at the time of the last review (MEFP ¶5). They noted that several initiatives and the large FDI in the agriculture sector will boost activity in the non-iron ore sectors and help the economy diversify. Given the uncertainty of the iron ore and other commodity prices, the authorities acknowledged the downside risk from a prolonged shock in the mining sector. In particular, since the iron ore company is producing at significant loss, the sustainability of their operation remains a major concern. The authorities agreed with staff projections of revenues and expenditures for the medium term (MEFP ¶28). Their key aims will be to increase non-iron ore revenue (MEFP ¶40) while improving expenditure management (MEFP ¶41). Page 18 ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
