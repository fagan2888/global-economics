has considerably enhanced transportation infrastructure and public utilities (Annex IV) . Although some of the largest projects have limited economic payoff (e.g., stadiums), the installed infrastructure “hardware” constitutes a considerable advantage relative to other sub-Saharan African countries. Nonetheless, economic diversification has remained elusive so far, and hydrocarbons have remained at more than 90 percent of total exports. Substantial challenges remain if is to spur diversification. To leverage the hardware, the “software” needs significant strengthening. Potential investors continue to be deterred by a weaker investment climate and lower human capital than in comparator countries: Other factors that could affect the tax yield include the cost structure and the stage of production. highlights two objectives: (i) transition from an oil dominated to a diversified economy; and (ii) the reduction of poverty and enhancement of social cohesion.

The country ranks low on property rights, bureaucratic procedures, regulatory quality, corruption, and rule of law. In addition, economic and social data is scarce, impairing investors’ ability to assess opportunities. On human capital, primary completion rates, teacher training, and repeat rates underperform countries of similar income, as well as the average in sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, new ventures are required to have a minimum of 90 percent of local employment. Furthermore, the recent decline in oil prices could lead to an overvalued real exchange rate unless there is an appropriate fiscal adjustment (Annex II). In recent years, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated relative to other CEMAC countries due to consistently higher inflation. Although analysis based on methodologies developed in Behms and Carvalho Filho (2009) and Araujo and others (2013) show no significant overvaluation, both are built on macroeconomic projections that assume a strong fiscal adjustment without which the current account would remain largely negative. More importantly, these assessments are based on very weak balance of payments statistics and hydrocarbon production projections in a highly uncertain international oil market. The authorities acknowledge these challenges and are taking action on several areas. Phase II of (2013–20) aims at improving governance, the business climate, and human capital formation. To that end, the authorities are: Negotiating with the World Bank a Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) agreement to improve the business climate as well as to establish electronic business registries and an investment promotion agency. Restructuring and computerizing public administration, and have taken steps to increase accountability and transparency by establishing a court of audit, ombudsman office, and an anti- corruption attorney’s office. indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, limited geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability. Equatorial Guinea is not included in the Global Competitiveness Index Ranking, a major international assessment of the investment climate. 80100Property RightsFreedom from CorruptionFiscal Freedom Gov't SpendingBusiness FreedomLabor FreedomMonetary FreedomTrade FreedomInvestment Freedom Financial Freedom Equatorial Guinea SSA Oil Exporting Text Figure 2.

Page 20 Fostering human capital formation by funding scholarships for foreign studies, developing school and technical training infrastructure, and hiring foreign teachers on an interim basis. Establishing a co-investment fund for projects in strategic sectors and new special economic zones. Given the limited success in growing new export sectors, the mission recommended a big push of comprehensive reforms aimed at the country’s “software” . Investor interest could be generated through an ambitious agenda encompassing actions to: Accelerate business climate reforms under the RAS agreement , and address investment bottlenecks by reevaluating local content rules and easing labor market rigidities. Support human capital development by prioritizing the equipping and staffing of new education infrastructure, as well as strengthening its links to the labor market. Advocate for reducing trade barriers intra-CEMAC and from CEMAC to other countries. An Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union could also catalyze investment. Immigration policies should be flexible enough so as to ensure adequate supply of human capital to investors. Catalyze investment through an IFC investment in the non-hydrocarbon sector and working with rating agencies on an assessment of the economy. Fiscal adjustment to avoid real exchange rate overvaluation . To maximize efficiency, spending should prioritize human development and the rising maintenance bill over tax expenditure, new infrastructure, a new administrative capital, or a co-investment fund. To the extent possible, public infrastructure investment should incorporate private sector design and management. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations. However, the authorities expressed their concern about reducing the local employment content and ownership, as well as of signing of the EPA. They argued that these actions could reduce employment, technological transfer, and diversification. They also considered the Co-Investment Fund essential for attracting private sector partners. With regard to more flexibility on immigration rules, they argued that there is need to be cognizant of security issues. They indicated that the eventual adoption of biometric identification by CEMAC countries could facilitate immigration of qualified workers. The Special Economic Zones planned include industrial complexes in Mbini, Sampaka, and Luba. Local content rules stipulate 90 percent local employment, and 35 percent local ownership on new ventures. Furthermore, the World Bank’s report find high redundancy costs minimum wages relative to value added in Equatorial Guinea. World Bank analysis broadly estimated that annual maintenance costs may rise by 2016 to between CFAF 300–500 billion. Page 21 Figure 3.
