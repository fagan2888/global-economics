An increase in the retirement age and tighter access to early retirement. The measures announced by the government (see Box 1 and Appendix IV) should make a significant contribution to raising employment rates and reducing the fiscal costs of ageing. The government still has to negotiate with social partners a number of issues, such as exceptions for hardship jobs and part time pension conditions. Thus, the fiscal impact from these reforms cannot yet be assessed, but the government stressed it was a major step forward in shifting the burden of adjustment away from the young and future generations. Tightening eligibility to unemployment benefits. The announced reforms address the two weakest aspects of Belgium’s unemployment insurance system: (i) its use as a bridge toward retirement which encourages early withdrawal from the labor force; (ii) generous eligibility rules for young workers first entering the labor force, which undermines work incentives and contributes to inactivity traps. The authorities recognized that these measures would likely not translate into significant employment gains in the short term, but emphasized the importance of these measures to change behaviors over time. Need to accompany these reforms with better active labor market policies and education. As recognized by the authorities, the benefits from increasing work incentives will be realized if workers are also given opportunities to improve skills and align them to the needs of the market. In these areas, Belgium scores very poorly: life-long professional training is well behind peers; and the education system suffers from some glaring, if localized, failures as well as generalized inadequacies in vocational training and school-to-work transition.
