Growth is expected to slow in 2016 to 1.2 percent . Oil output growth is projected to slow to 0.6 percent (with oil production assumed to average 10.2 mb/d) and non-oil growth to 1.6 percent, the latter due to the impact of fiscal consolidation and tighter liquidity conditions, higher funding costs, and slowing credit growth (Box 1 discusses the determinants of bank credit in Saudi Arabia). In 2017, real GDP growth is expected to recover to 2 percent as the pace of fiscal consolidation eases. The recovery in private ud pub ud ud pub ud RR ud ub ill ili Page 12 non-oil growth is, however, projected to weaken toward the end of the projection period in the baseline as rising government debt increases the risk premium and crowds-out credit growth. Fiscal Developments 2014–16 The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 13 percent of GDP in 2016 under the baseline scenario. This is based on policies in the 2016 budget and other policies that have an announced implementation schedule (see Table 6 for assumptions). Higher energy and water prices introduced in late 2015 (ranging from 10-134 percent) and increased transfers from public entities to the budget should generate additional revenues of 1.3 percent of GDP and 1.6 percent of GDP, respectively. Oil revenues are expected to decline relative to 2015, while spending restraint, particularly on the capital side, will result in a substantial reduction in spending. Beyond 2016, the fiscal deficit is expected to decline further to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2021, driven by higher oil revenues (about 3 percent of GDP), higher non-oil revenues (about 1 percent of GDP), mainly from the VAT and higher excise taxes which are partly offset by lower transfers from public entities, and a gradual further reduction in capital spending as a number of existing projects reach completion. The baseline scenario does not include additional spending measures in the NTP or additional revenue measures that have not been clearly specified. The fiscal deficit is projected to be financed through a mix of deposit drawdown and domestic and international borrowing. The government’s net financial asset position (defined as government deposits less gross debt) moves from +38 percent of GDP in 2015 to -17 percent of GDP in 2021. nu illi illi )( – z illi – Page 13 Box 1. Supply and Demand of Bank Credit in Saudi Arabia: Challenges and Opportunities Bank credit constitutes a key channel of transmission from oil prices to the real economy in Saudi Arabia . Empirical evidence suggests that the supply and demand of bank credit to the private sector are affected by bank characteristics and macroeconomic conditions. Bank-level credit growth is modeled using a range of bank-specific and macroeconomic variables (Table 1). The results suggest that: The supply of bank credit to the private sector improves as the capital ratio increases and deposit growth strengthens. Credit supply weakens as banks provision for NPLs. Increases in excess liquidity in the banking system boosts credit extension. Bank credit growth declines as banks increase their holdings of government bonds (suggesting “crowding-out”). It also weakens as specialized credit institutions (SCIs) expand lending, suggesting the existence of competition rather than complementarity between these institutions and banks in the segments of the market they work in. The demand for credit from the private sector increases with higher oil prices and stronger activity in the non-oil private sector. Financial deepening, proxied by bank credit to the private sector as a share of nonoil GDP, helps unlock demand for credit. Fixed Effects Panel Model of Bank-Level Real Credit Growth in Saudi Arabia Model predictions help understand why credit growth has remained robust despite the sharp drop in oil prices (Figure 1; using model 7). Credit growth held up well in 2015, supported by strong bank balance sheets and economic activity even as deposit growth slowed. Looking ahead, credit growth could slow further reflecting lagged effects of slow deposit growth, and if the capital ratios decline, provisioning for NPLs accelerates, or growth slows further. These results suggest that, to support bank credit in the period ahead, bank balance sheets need to remain strong. Banks need to maintain sufficient capital even as low oil prices start putting balance sheets under pressure. Provisioning for NPLs reduces credit extension, but is essential for safeguarding financial stability. Greater confidence in the banking system also helps attract customer deposits and support credit supply. Greater lending by SCIs does not increase bank credit, but fiscal adjustment and a reduced reliance on banks to finance the budget deficit could support credit to the private sector. nu agg an ha +**+**+* ……… +**+**+** Y –***–***–*** ……… –***–***–*** Y +***+***+*** ……… +***+***+*** Y –––+––––– Y ab +*** ……… +***+ +***+* –** ………………… pp …… –*** ……………… NN ……… +** ++*** +* pp …………… +*** ……… du mm YYYYYYYYY NN _ upp bu * < ** < *** < bu du Page 14 The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and then move close to balance by 2021 as oil prices rise . Financial outflows are also projected to slow as banks and pension funds reverse their foreign investments and buy domestic government debt, and the government borrows externally. SAMA’s NFA are expected to fall substantially further in 2016, but the pace of decline will slow over the medium term. Inflation is expected at a little over 4 percent in 2016. Higher energy prices led to a sharp increase in inflation in January, but slowing growth over the year is expected to reduce underlying pressures (Figure 7). After easing in 2017, inflation is expected to pick-up in 2018 with the introduction of the VAT, before easing again to 2 percent in 2019–21. Key risks to the growth outlook include (see Risk Assessment Matrix): Global oil market uncertainties. Futures markets and consensus forecasts suggest oil price risks are skewed to the upside. Nevertheless, with excess capacity in the market and downside risks to global growth, a further drop in prices remains a possibility (Box 2 discusses how oil production/prices affect the fiscal balance). More volatile global financial market conditions. These could constrain external financing, putting additional pressure on reserves, domestic liquidity, and credit. Reform implementation. Quick progress in prioritizing and implementing reforms in the NTP and other policy documents could boost growth relative to staff’s baseline. A failure to implement fiscal adjustment may increase growth in the near-term, but at the cost of higher debt and interest rates and pressures on the exchange rate peg with negative effects on growth in the medium-term. On the other hand, too rapid a fiscal adjustment would hurt growth excessively in the near-term. An escalation of regional tensions or domestic security concerns could hurt confidence and growth. Economic developments in Saudi Arabia have an important impact on the other GCC countries and the broader MENA region . The channels include imports, remittances, tourism, aid, and financial flows, the importance of which varies across countries (Box 3). As growth slows in Saudi Arabia this year, it is expected to have an impact on countries in the region with Bahrain, which has strong ties to Saudi Arabia, perhaps likely to be one of the most affected. Page 15 Nature/source of main risks Likelihood/Time Saudi Arabia: Risk Assessment Matrix Expected impact on the economy if Horizon risk is realized Policy Response Persistently low energy prices, triggered by supply factors reversing only gradually High/Medium-term Government does not implement fiscal adjustment plans Low/Medium-term Private sector employment opportunities do not increase fast enough to provide jobs for the young population Medium/Medium- term Heightened risk of fragmentation /security dislocation in part of the Middle East, Africa, and Europe leading to a sharp rise in migrant flows with negative global spillovers High/Short-term High A 10 percent permanent decline in oil prices would reduce fiscal and external balances by 2.3 and 2.8 percentage points of GDP, respectively, assuming no policy response. GDP growth would drop by 0.5 percentage points a year assuming the government fully offsets the revenue losses with expenditure cuts. Adverse confidence effects in the private sector and drying up of liquidity in the banking system could reduce credit availability and amplify negative spillovers. Fiscal policy would need to adjust to reflect the realities of lower oil prices. Policymakers should intensify diversification efforts to partially offset potential negative spillovers from lower oil prices. The authorities should ensure adequate banking system liquidity and carefully monitor banks for signs of stress. High The government has announced an ambitious fiscal adjustment in the 2016 budget and the objective of balancing the budget going forward. If this adjustment does not materialize, the fiscal path will be considerably worse than in the baseline. Net debt will rise quite rapidly, borrowing costs will increase, risks of crowding-out will rise, and pressures on the exchange rate peg will increase. Ensure fiscal consolidation objectives are adhered to, and strengthen budgetary processes to support this. High Absorbing new labor market entrants into government jobs is not be an option going forward given the need for fiscal consolidation. Unless private sector hiring increases, unemployment will rise. Further labor market reforms are needed to increase the employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector. Low Heightened tensions and conflict in the Middle East could result in higher oil prices if oil supply is threatened. The positive impact on the economy from higher oil prices could, however, be offset if confidence and investment falls, financial market volatility increases in response to heightened regional tensions, and if spending on defense and security increases. Higher oil prices would ease pressure on the fiscal position, but fiscal adjustment would still be needed over the medium- term. Increased efforts at diversification would remain important. If growth was significantly affected by a loss of confidence, there could be a case for temporarily slowing the pace of fiscal adjustment. Low Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions: Sharp asset price adjustment and decompression of credit spreads Medium/Short- term Surge in the U.S. dollar High/Short-term Tighter financial market conditions could affect the government’s ability to borrow from international markets, thus increasing the domestic financing requirement. Bank funding costs may also increase. Given the peg, dollar strength would appreciate the riyal. This, however, would have a minimal impact on growth or the current account given small non- hydrocarbon exports and limited substitutability between domestic production and imports. Banks should prove resilient as any open foreign exchange positions (subject to prudential limits) are largely in U.S. dollars. Continued strong fundamentals would likely prevent excessive volatility in Saudi Arabian financial markets. Large financial cushions are in place to mitigate the impact. The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. Page 16 Box 2. Outlook for the Global Oil Market and the Potential Role of Saudi Arabia Oversupply in the global oil market is declining, although the market appears likely to remain slightly oversupplied in the near term . The June 2016 IEA monthly report expects global oil demand to grow by 1.3mb/d in 2016 and 2017. On the supply side, non-OPEC supply, mostly driven by US light tight oil and some one- off factors, is expected to decline by 0.9 mb/d in 2016 and pick up slightly by 0.3 mb/d in 2017. In OPEC, higher oil production in Iran and Iraq has more than offset production difficulties in Nigeria. These demand and supply developments are reducing excess supply in the market, although stocks are high and will take some time to clear. There also remain considerable uncertainties about the supply and demand outlook. Three scenarios are considered to analyze what would happen to Saudi Arabia’s oil revenues if it decided to reduce its output to eliminate estimated excess supply in the market . These scenarios are: (i) a cut in oil production by all the estimated excess supply of 0.9 mb/d in 2016 by Saudi Arabia alone, (ii) Saudi Arabia cuts by half of the excess supply (0.4 mb/d) and other OPEC producers jointly cut by the remaining 0.4 mb/d and (iii) Saudi Arabia, other OPEC, and non-OPEC (each cut one third of the excess supply). These production cuts would increase oil prices by 5-18 percent depending on price elasticity of demand. The impact on Saudi oil revenues could be negligible or negative if Saudi absorbs all the output cut. If the cuts are shared across OPEC and non-OPEC, however, the impact on Saudi oil revenues is positive in most scenarios. (Table 2). …… pp oo in mb/d Saudi Oil Production cut 1/ Only Saudi cuts production All OPEC cut production OPEC + Non-OPEC Price Elasticity of Demand-0.2-0.1-0.05percent change Impact on oil prices Impact on Saudi fiscal balance in percent of GDP Only Saudi cuts production-1%0%1%All OPEC cut production-0.1%0.5%1.8%OPEC + Non-OPEC0.1%0.8%2.0% Sources: IEA, and IMF staff estimates. 2/ Assuming no supply reaction, price elasticity of demand of -0.05, -0.1 and -0.2 implies that a one percent increase in oil supply would lead to fall in oil prices by 20 percent, 10 percent and 5 percent respectively. Table 2. Impact of supply cuts under various scenario for the baseline outlook in 2016 1/ 1/ Assumes total oil production cut to be equal to the estimated excess supply of 0.9 mb/d. Page 17 Box 3. Saudi Arabia—Spillovers to the GCC/MENA Region The economic slowdown and the fiscal and external outlook of Saudi Arabia could adversely affect neighboring GCC/MENA counties through three main channels (Figure): Imports : Most imports come from outside MENA, and more than 50 percent of Saudi Arabia’s imports from MENA comes from 4 countries (UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, and Oman). Bahrain and Egypt, and to a lesser degree Oman, will be affected most by a slowdown of Saudi imports (the impact on UAE is marginal as Saudi Arabia’s imports from UAE represent less than 5 percent of its non-oil exports). Stronger impact will be felt by countries outside MENA given the low share of MENA in total Saudi Arabia imports (about 10 percent). Remittances : Total remittances from Saudi Arabia were estimated at $38 billion in 2015. Five countries (Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria) receive about 90 percent of Saudi Arabia’s remittances outflows to MENA. If fiscal consolidation and labor market reforms translate into lower employment of expatriate labor and eventually a decline in remittances flows, Yemen and Egypt, and to a lesser but still significant degree, Jordan and Syria, will be most affected through this channel within MENA. However, in addition to economic considerations, geopolitical and security concerns will impact developments on this front, particularly the ongoing conflict in Yemen and refugee crisis stemming from the ongoing war in Syria. In addition, it is worth noting that remittances to MENA represent only about 30 percent of total Saudi Arabia remittances flows which means that any impact will propagate to countries beyond MENA, mostly in Asia. Tourism travel : Bahrain will be by far the most affected in the region (and even globally) as Saudi Arabia tourist arrivals into Bahrain represent more than 50 percent of its total tourist arrivals, and Saudi Arabia travels (tourist arrivals) to outside MENA are only about 10 percent of total Saudi Arabian travels. It is worth noting, however, that it is not clear to what extent Saudi Arabian’s travel to Bahrain is likely to be affected by the slowdown of economic activity in Saudi Arabia, given the proximity and close ties between the two countries. The impact may be more significant for Jordan, especially if this is coupled with a decline in remittances. Spillovers to GCC/MENA countries from Saudi Arabia economic slowdown could also be felt through other channels: Aid : a decline in aid would likely affect countries like Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, and Yemen—who have been receiving significant support from Saudi Arabia particularly since 2011. Financial channel : high government borrowing to finance the budget may lead to repatriation/lower FDI or portfolio investments, with potential adverse effects on countries including, in particular, Bahrain and UAE where the financial sectors have higher exposure to Saudi Arabia. Preliminary regression analysis on a sample of the 6 GCC countries suggests that the slowdown in non-oil growth in Saudi Arabia is likely to impact Bahrain. In particular, it suggests that a slowdown in non-oil growth in Saudi Arabia by 1 percentage point would reduce non-oil growth in Bahrain by 0.8 -1 percentage point. Saudi growth also appears to affect growth in Oman, although its influence is sensitive to the sample period. Further, the effect of growth in oil prices and global demand on Bahrain and Oman is also felt through their impact on Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s non-oil growth influence on other GCC economies appears statistically insignificant, although this may be due to sample size/period coverage.
