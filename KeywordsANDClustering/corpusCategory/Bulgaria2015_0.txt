Bulgaria’s reputation for macro-financial stability came under scrutiny in 2014. The year was marked by a severe test to the banking system and a sharp deterioration in the hitherto strong fiscal stance. Political turbulence and unaddressed governance issues heightened concerns about the direction of macro-financial policy, increasing strain on the economic outlook. The difficult external environment further weighed on economic activity. These developments led S&P to downgrade Bulgaria’s credit rating to below investment grade and triggered the EC’s February 2015 decision to step up the macroeconomic imbalances procedure for Bulgaria. Urgent policy action is needed to address near-term challenges and anchor Bulgaria’s medium-term convergence path.
