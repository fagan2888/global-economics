SOLID FUNDAMENTALS Growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis has remained low. Output has not yet recovered to pre-crisis levels, and employment has fallen by 13 percent from its peak (Figure 1). Growth declined from 0.8 percent in 2012 to 0.2 percent in the first half of 2013 as domestic uncertainties undermined demand, with unchanged private consumption and a decline in investment (Figure 2 and Tables 1–3). Good agricultural performance, strong export growth (8.0 percent year-on-year), and higher government spending supported the economy. GDP began to recover in the third quarter of 2013 to an estimated 1.5 percent year-on-year as exports continued to perform well.

Strong macroeconomic and financial sector policies have mitigated vulnerabilities arising from the difficult external and domestic environment, but challenges remain: The current account, which reached a deficit of 25 percent of GDP in 2007, is now registering a small surplus, and reserves are comfortable with a reserve adequacy index of 129 (Table 1). Financial inflows are moderate and stable, consisting mostly of FDI at about 3 percent of GDP a year. The international investment position has improved in line with the fall in external debt (Figure 3, Tables 4–5). The reduction in banks’ foreign liabilities has been gradual and is largely driven by plentiful bank liquidity, resulting in a positive net foreign asset position for the first time since 2006. Bulgaria was largely unaffected by the swings in capital flows to emerging markets following concerns about tapering last summer, as its stock market capitalization and domestic public debt are low, at about 10 percent of GDP each, and banks (three quarters of which are subsidiaries of EU banks) are funded mainly by domestic deposits. The fiscal deficit fell to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2012, below the budgeted deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP (Figure 4). However, this performance was largely due to lower-than-planned public investment expenditure. Public debt, at 17.6 percent of GDP at end-2012, is the second lowest in the EU and the debt sustainability analysis shows it well contained (Appendix I). Inward spillovers occur more through trade with the euro zone (notably Germany and Italy) and neighboring countries (particularly Romania and Turkey), and direct investment primarily from the European Union (also see “Interconnectedness and Spillovers from the Euro Area to Bulgaria,” 2012 Staff Report, Annex I).

Bulgaria: Fiscal Developments, 2005–15 Page 11 Inflation has been low and in line with that of trading partners in recent years (Figure 5). Following reductions in administered electricity prices, inflation turned negative in the second half of 2013. Credit growth, which peaked at 63 percent in 2007, has been flat in 2013. Capitalization and liquidity of the financial sector are high (Figure 6). Although gross nonperforming loans (NPLs)—a legacy from the boom period and subsequent crisis—amounted to 17.2 percent of loans in September, coverage by provisions is comfortable at 72.7 percent. The REER is broadly in line with fundamentals. Estimates suggest that the exchange rate is slightly undervalued, the current account is somewhat stronger than the norm, and Bulgaria’s export market share Bulgaria: Exchange Rate Assessment Methodology REER required adjustment Underlying current Current account Macroeconomic balance approach 1 External sustainability approach 1/ Equilibrium exchange rate 1/ The current account elasticity with respect to the REER is 0.3.

However, real unit labor costs remain higher than in the boom years (with continued increases in nominal wages), international reserves remain broadly stable, and the rise in market share is consistent with Bulgaria’s ongoing integration in the world economy. Reductions in unemployment over the last decade have been erased as a result of the crisis. While employment rose slightly in 2013, the unemployment rate has not begun to decline as more of the population entered the workforce. Given that the output gap is not large, most of the unemployment is structural and characterized by significant age, gender, and regional disparities.
