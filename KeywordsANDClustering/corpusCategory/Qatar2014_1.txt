Growth, Inflation, and Population, 2002-13 (In percent, y-o-y growth) GDP growth Inflation Population growth 2011q1 2011q3 2012q1 2012q3 2013q1 2013q3 Sources: Qatar Central Bank; Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics; and Haver Analytics. Qatar’s macroeconomic performance has remained strong (Figure 1). GDP growth slowed from 13 percent in 2011 to 6.2 percent in 2012, largely as a result of the self-imposed moratorium on new hydrocarbon investments in the North Field. Growth is estimated to have remained around 6 percent in 2013, driven by a 10 percent expansion in the nonhydrocarbon sector, particularly construction, transport, communications, and finance. The nonhydrocarbon sector now accounts for almost one-half of the economy. Page 6 The negative spillovers from sluggish global growth and financial market volatility have been limited . The tight LNG market and supply disruptions among other oil producers have kept hydrocarbon prices high. Announcements regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset purchases modestly raised the cost of external funding and contributed to money market volatility, but have had no discernible effect on the local lending rates so far. The recent emerging market turmoil has not affected local financial markets given strong fundamentals and modest financial linkages. Real Estate Prices, 2006-13 (Index, 2006q2=100) Inflation increased early last year due to increased housing demand, but has fallen since then. With rents and related components constituting over 30 percent of the CPI basket, a strong inflow of expatriate workers in the context of diminishing housing market slack pushed up CPI inflation to 3.7 percent y-o-y in April 2013. However, inflation has eased to 2.7 percent y-o-y in February 2014 as housing supply increased and rent growth decelerated. Core inflation excluding food, rent, and utilities has also been on a downward trend, with February core inflation at 1.6 percent. House prices have been growing strongly since the crisis- related drop in 2008–09, but according to crude measures, valuations appear broadly in line with fundamentals. 2006q2 2007q2 2008q2 2009q2 2010q2 2011q2 2012q2 2013q2 Real estate price index Consumer price index Nominal non-oil GDP Sources: Qatar Central Bank; and Haver Analytics. Overheating phase The central government budget continues to post large surpluses (Figure 2). The FY2012/13 budget surplus increased to 9 percent of GDP on the back of strong growth in revenues (especially from the nonhydrocarbon sector), despite a substantial overrun in current expenditures. Spending on infrastructure and other capital projects was broadly unchanged, but capital expenditures have picked up during the current fiscal year. The underlying non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance as a share of non-hydrocarbon GDP has been improving since the global financial crisis, from -54 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in FY2010/11 to an estimated -46 percent of non- hydrocarbon GDP in FY2013/14 (ending March 2014). Gross government debt as of March 2014 is projected at 34 percent of GDP, with the authorities issuing T-bills and T-bonds for financial market development and liquidity management purposes. Net debt remains negative considering the QIA’s large assets. The current account recorded a surplus of 32 percent of GDP in 2012 and another high surplus can also be expected in 2013 , reflecting sustained high prices of LNG, crude oil, and condensates exports. LNG prices in Qatar’s main export markets in Asia have so far remained largely unaffected by the rapid growth in the U.S. unconventional gas and oil production. The real effective exchange rate remained roughly unchanged during 2013. Page 7 Monetary and credit conditions remain accommodative, but public sector credit growth has slowed substantially (Figure 3). Accommodative U.S. monetary policy has been mirrored by low policy rates in Qatar. Broad money and private sector credit have continued to grow robustly, while the share of real estate lending has somewhat moderated. However, public sector credit growth has slowed substantially, partly reflecting previous strong growth and delays with infrastructure investments. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) started requiring an approval for new borrowing by public sector enterprises since October 2013. The banking sector is profitable and liquid. Tier 1 capital stood at 15 percent of risk- weighted assets at end-2013 and NPLs remain below 2 percent despite a recent slight increase. Banks remain highly profitable with a return on assets at 2 percent. Liquidity buffers are strong, with liquid assets around 50 percent of total assets. Foreign funding of commercial banks—which increased substantially in recent years—has been pared back from 30 percent of total liabilities at its peak in early 2012 to about 23 percent at present, and its maturity structure has improved, with short-term loans gradually replaced by longer-term securities. The aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 1.2 to 1.0 over the past year, partly due to rising public sector deposits.
