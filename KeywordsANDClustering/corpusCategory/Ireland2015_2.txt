Prospects for a self-sustaining recovery appear favorable although euro area developments present risks in the near and medium term. The ECB’s quantitative easing is of particular benefit given Ireland’s strong trade outside the euro area and the ongoing need to address debt overhangs. Growth is projected to moderate to 3½ percent in 2015 and to gradually ease to a 2½ percent pace . With the latest WEO maintaining growth of Ireland’s trading partners at 2 percent, export growth is projected to revert to about 4 percent from 2015. Investment growth decelerates modestly yet remains brisk given the low base. In view of still high household debt, the baseline is for a gradual revival of private consumption supported by rising disposable income. Inflation rises only slowly as unemployment declines towards 8 percent by 2018. The Irish authorities’ growth outlook is about ½ percent higher in 2015, primarily due to a quicker revival of private consumption. Their projection for growth of about 3½ percent in the medium term mostly reflects lower import growth, and on the supply side is underpinned by higher productivity growth than the 1 percent pace staff assumes (based on OECD research placing Ireland in the “close to frontier” economies) together with faster employment growth. This growth and investment outlook will increasingly require credit flows in the medium term, with banks expected to play the main role . Despite the strong growth in 2014, bank credit to the private sector declined by about 5 percent y/y, similar to the declines in previous years of weak or negative growth. But rising investment is expected to increase financing needs over time, with initial signs of such a pick up seen in mortgage approvals (Figure 2). This outlook is consistent with expectations of major Irish banks for loan balances to stabilize and for credit to then grow broadly in line with GDP in the medium term. Gross lending volumes would be larger, and together with continued financing by retained earnings and FDI, would support investment while avoiding the past high reliance on wholesale funding. 80 percent range Median private sector forecasts (Jan. 2015) IMF baseline forecast EC Winter 2015 CBI January Monetary Bulletin OECD Winter forecast Dept. of Finance (Budget) Real GDP Growth Projections (Percent)Sources: Bloomberg; and IMF staff estimates. Page 11 Ireland’s market access is robust and on highly favorable terms, reflecting its improved economic outlook and euro area developments including quantitative easing The NTMA has already secured over half of Ireland’s 2015 financing needs. It has also made further early repayments to the IMF, equivalent to €3.5 billion in February, bringing total early repayments to 54 percent of Fund lending. The ECB’s public sector purchase program (PSPP) will support continued highly favorable financing terms—staff’s preliminary estimates are for the CBI to purchase in the secondary market the equivalent of over half of the bonds the NTMA is expected to issue through September 2016. Soon after the ECB announcement, the NTMA raised €4 billion from the sale of its first 30-year bond at a yield of 2.1 percent. While gross financing needs are projected to fluctuate significantly in the medium term, the authorities have in the past successfully smoothed amortization humps. Ireland’s external position is sustainable and the economy remains competitive EBA’s three approaches suggest that the current account and the real exchange rate are in line with economic fundamentals and desired policy setting (Annex I). The Current Account and External Sustainability approaches suggest a small undervaluation, but this may reflect the treatment of retained earnings of redomiciled firms. The small overvaluation on an REER basis in 2014 has been unwound by the recent euro depreciation. Competitiveness is strong in the services export sector, albeit driven by industries with relatively low domestic value added.

Page 12 Risks to Ireland’s growth prospects are broadly balanced within a wide range, with key sources being (Box 2) Financial market volatility could be triggered by a range of factors, yet Ireland’s vulnerability appears to be contained Financial conditions are currently exceptionally favorable for both the sovereign and banks. A reassessment of sovereign risk in Europe or geopolitical developments could result in renewed volatility and spread widening. But market developments currently suggest contagion to Ireland would be contained by OMT and PSPP. Yet continued easy international financial conditions could lead to vulnerabilities in the medium term For example, if the international search for yield drove up Irish commercial property prices, risks of an eventual slump in prices and construction would increase, weakening economic activity and potentially impacting domestic banks. Euro area stagnation would impede exports Export projections are below the average growth in the past five years of 4¾ percent, implying some upside especially given recent euro depreciation. Yet Ireland is vulnerable to stagnation of the euro area, which accounts for 40 percent of exports. Over time, international action on corporate taxation could reduce Ireland’s attractiveness for some export-oriented FDI, but the authorities see limited risks in practice given other competitive advantages and as the corporate tax rate is not affected. Domestic demand could sustain its recent momentum, yet concerns remain around possible weak lending in the medium term . Consumption growth may exceed the pace projected in coming years given improving property and labor market conditions. However, domestic demand recovery could in time be hindered by a weak lending revival if Basel III capital requirements became binding owing to insufficient bank profits, or if slow NPL resolution were to limit the redeployment of capital to profitable new loans. Public debt remains high and growth shortfalls are the key risk to the debt outlook From 123 percent in 2013, public debt fell notably in 2014 to an estimated 111 percent of GDP (Annex II accounts for this fall). Under the baseline, gross debt falls below 100 percent of GDP in 2018. A temporary shock to nominal GDP growth would hurt these dynamics: if growth were to drop 2 percentage points below the baseline in 2015–16, debt would rise to 112 percent of GDP in 2017. If compounded by a cumulative worsening of the primary balance by 3.1 percent of GDP over 2015–20 and a 2 percentage point rise in interest rates on new debt, debt would peak at 113 percent of GDP in 2017. On the upside, disposal of the state’s stakes in banks in coming years could significantly lower public debt; its holdings in AIB and BoI were recently valued at about 8 percent of GDP by the NTMA.

A surge in financial volatility, as investors reassess underlying risk and move to safe-haven assets Ireland’s high level of private and public debt make it susceptible to financial contagion. Box 2. Ireland: Risk Assessment Matrix Relative Likelihood H Impact Market developments suggest any spread widening is most likely contained by the ECB’s OMT and QE. To the extent spreads did widen, the impact on deficits and debt is limited by low financing needs. The impact on growth could be more significant if there was also a reversal of inflows into commercial property. Policy response Continue phased and steady fiscal adjustmentto ensure market confidence in access to euro area backstops. H The export growth impact would be significant but moderated to the extent that U.S. and U.K. markets remained robust. However protracted EA weakness could undermine domestic confidence, investment, and FDI inflows. With Irish elections due no later than early 2016, external political developments could increase challenges to expenditure control in 2015 and undermine adjustment in Budget 2016. Yet the strong trackrecord of the Irish authorities limits such risks. ECB policy actions should help revive growth and could also aid competitiveness. Strengthen growth potential through reforms in OECD Going for Growth Maintain steady fiscal adjustment. II. Protracted period of slower growth in advanced economies, especially in the euro area . Ireland’s exports were 110 percent of GDP in 2014, with the Euro Area some 40 percent of the total. III. Bond market stress from a reassessment of sovereign risk Sovereign stress re-emerges due to policy uncertainty and faltering of reforms, and political and social upheaval, particularly in Greece. IV. Financial imbalances from protracted period of low interest rates The international search for yield appears to be a significant factor driving Irish commercial real estate markets. V. Excessively low inflation This would slow the decline in Ireland’s high private and public debt levels. Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relatively likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (with L, M, H, denote low, medium, a nd high, respectively). The RAM reflects staff views on the sources of risk and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Deploying prudential policy instruments to limit the exposure of domestic banks to potential asset price bubbles if they begin to emerge, including in commercial real estate. ECB policy actions should contribute to mitigating imported disinflation in Ireland. Low domestic credit growth limits risks. Yet further strong inflows into commercial real estate could eventually generate over-building and risks of future slump in prices. H Lasting low inflation could lead to high savings and lower investment given the slower decline in private debt burdens. Page 14
