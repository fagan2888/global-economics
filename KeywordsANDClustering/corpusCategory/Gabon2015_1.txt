The growth outlook has deteriorated (Figure 2) In light of a weak performance during the first nine months of the year, the forecast of 2015 GDP growth has been revised down from 4.4 percent to 4.0 percent, driven by a slowdown in non-oil activity (5.8 to 4.0 percent). Inflation is expected to be around zero percent in 2015, much lower than in 2014. Continued weakness in the oil sector is expected to weigh on prospects for oil exploration and government revenue, leading to a further deceleration of overall growth in 2016 to 3.2 percent. A pick-up of growth is expected in 2017–18 as large-scale palm oil and rubber production by Olam International ramps up. However, the negative outlook for the oil sector has led to a downward revision of the overall medium-term growth rate to around 4.5 percent per annum, a decline of more than one percentage point since the 2014 Article IV consultation.

As seen in Text Table 1, if government spending items were to grow in line with non-oil GDP, or oil prices remain at US$5 per barrel below the current baseline of the IMF’s World Economic Outlook , the government would be forced to deplete available deposits, and significantly increase borrowing and arrears. At the same time, slower global growth and tighter international financing conditions will entail additional headwinds to the Gabonese economy. Ancillary risks concern a stronger-than-expected spillover of the oil price shock to non-oil economic activity (including to the financial sector), as well as persistent fragility at three small distressed state-owned banks, one of which recently experienced severe liquidity problems prompting government intervention. Several risk scenarios would require further fiscal tightening and, therefore, spending prioritization (Annex I). Such would be the case if oil prices or non-oil revenues are lower than projected, as well as scenarios that demand unexpected additional spending due to regional insecurity or political turmoil. If the oil price shock or existing problems in public banks were to significantly affect banking stability, the national and regional authorities would need to take decisive action through the relevant supervisory and regulatory institutions to strengthen compromised banks (through restructuring and recapitalization if needed), and minimize contagion risk.

No fiscal adjustment scenario assumes that government spending continues to grow in line with non-oil GDP growth, whereas the baseline scenario assumes a gradual decline in all spending headline items as a share of non-oil GDP. It is assumed that the government finances its deficits first through its available deposits at the central bank and borrows afterwards. Oil Price Scenario assumes that oil prices remain US$ 5 below projections in the World Economic Outlook. It is assumed that the government finances its deficits first through its available deposits at the central bank and borrows afterwards. Page 13
