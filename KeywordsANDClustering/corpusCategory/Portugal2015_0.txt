Following a decade of running large current account deficits, Portugal attained a balanced current account position over the course of the 2011–14 EFF, but at the cost of large internal slack. In the run-up to and since euro adoption, easy access to external financing enabled Portugal to finance imports, largely for consumption and investment in the non-tradable sector. With the accompanying erosion of competitiveness, productivity growth continued its inexorable decline while economic growth stagnated—real GDP barely grew between the early 2000s and today—and a large external imbalance arose. The “sudden stop” in 2011 forced an adjustment that corrected the flow imbalance, and Portugal’s external position stabilized. The accompanying collapse in domestic demand contributed to a large internal imbalance, with unemployment peaking at 17.5 percent in 2013 before beginning to decline; labor market slack, a broader measure of labor under-utilization, is still around 20 percent. Portugal’s rebound has been characterized by a U-shaped recovery. The economy has expanded at close to 1 percent per year on average since early 2013, with growth driven largely by consumption. Following the front-loaded fiscal adjustment under the program, the 2014 fiscal deficit narrowed to 3.5 percent of GDP (excluding one-off operations), resulting in a second successive year of 1 percent structural primary adjustment. The better fiscal outturn relative to earlier projections partly reflected cyclical factors, as rising consumption and employment contributed to good revenue This analysis uses the Swan diagram, a macroeconomic model of a small open economy. An economy attains internal balance (IB) when it has full employment and stable prices. External balance (EB) requires equilibrium in the balance of payments. For a discussion of the Swan diagram see Reinert, K. (ed.) 2009. The Princeton encyclopedia of the world economy, pp. 1049–1052. Labor market slack adds discouraged workers to official unemployment and labor force and adjusts for involuntary part-time work.

In addition, a sizable under-execution of investments spending helped offset the adverse Constitutional Court (CC) rulings on public sector wages and on survivor pensions. The main recommendations of the 2012 Article IV Consultation were incorporated into the EFF (see Annex I). Despite significant progress made on many fronts in the period since then, increasing competitiveness remains an important challenge, as elaborated in the current report. The banking system is recovering gradually, but the return to profitability remains elusive. Banks’ capital declined in 2014, with the average CT1 ratio falling by 0.5 percentage point to 11.4 percent. The loan-to-deposit ratio has been declining steadily, allowing banks to reduce their reliance on Eurosystem refinancing operations. The stock of non-performing loans continued to rise, a reflection of the slow progress toward repairing corporate balance sheets. Income from financial operations and trading has not been sufficient to offset losses due to provisions and impairments, and high operating costs. The sale of Novo Banco is proceeding as scheduled, and other mergers and acquisitions of large banks are under consideration. Novo Banco is the bridge bank created at the time of the resolution of Banco Espírito Santo (BES), to which critical functions and viable operations of BES were transferred.

Page 8 The trend of downward inflation pressures, boosted more recently by falling energy prices, appears to have been arrested. Core inflation has stabilized in recent months, but remains low at 0.3 percent due to the sizeable output gap. Portugal’s overall inflation now exceeds that of the euro area for the first time in two years. The authorities have begun early repurchases of outstanding Fund credit. In March, the authorities repurchased €6.6 billion— almost one quarter of the total owed to the Fund—coinciding with the initiation of the European Central Bank’s expanded asset purchase program (QE), and benefitting from favorable market conditions. Early repurchases are overall expected to result in interest cost savings exceeding €500 million, but offset to some degree by recent valuation losses from the euro’s depreciation against the SDR basket, as the initial IMF purchases were not fully hedged. The near-term outlook is benefiting from the trifecta of record-low interest rates, a weakening euro, and low oil prices. The initiation of QE proved to be a sea change. With a total envelope for Portugal of to up to €1 billion a month, sovereign bond purchases could amount to the equivalent of about 60 percent of planned debt issuance in 2015, alleviating remaining concerns on Portugal meeting its financing needs in 2015–16. A sharply weaker euro—also likely associated at least in part with QE—and lower oil prices have improved the outlook further. Staff’s growth projections for 2015 and 2016 have accordingly been revised up. The outlook for inflation has also improved over the forecast horizon. Source: Bloomberg. Source: Bloomberg.

Page 9 As the additional bounce from short-term factors fades, growth is projected to moderate over the medium term. To absorb the large labor market slack by creating jobs, the economy needs to raise investment, while enhancing external competitiveness to avoid generating an external imbalance. For a currency union member with limited fiscal space, this can only be achieved through structural reforms, which have so far not fully delivered the desired outcomes. Many of the structural reforms initiated since 2011 still need to be fully implemented. There also appears to be a need to revisit or step up many of the structural reforms, especially in the public and financial sector areas (Box 1). At the same time, other indicators suggest that Portugal continues to lag behind most peers and trade competitors, including in Eastern Europe, regarding labor and product market reforms (Figure 2). In addition, excessive leverage and elevated economic policy uncertainty acts as a brake on investment prospects. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Objectives, Influencing Factors, and Current Status Source: IMF staff. During the program, staff was of the view that sustained implementation of structural reforms would reverse the decline in productivity growth observed over the last half-century, resulting in medium-term growth of 1¾ percent. With more limited progress on structural reforms, however, staff projects growth of only around 1¼ percent in the medium term, ¼ percentage points below the euro-area average.

The EBA estimates are mixed, with the REER gap estimates—ranging from -5 to 9 percent—broadly reflecting the achievement of short-term external balance. As internal demand conditions normalize, competitiveness will suffer, barring further reform effort (see Swan Diagram). Furthermore, the EBA estimates do not fully capture the burden of the large negative NIIP and the need to ambitiously reduce labor slack. Alleviating this burden will require sustained current account surpluses at or above the projected 2015 level over the medium term (see Annex III). Figure 2.

Global liquidity and risk aversion are favorable but could unwind rapidly due to potentially disruptive tail events—most notably, any volatility associated with turmoil at the euro-area level (see Risk Assessment Matrix). Public and private balance sheets are highly exposed to these risks. In addition, Portugal’s trade with and investment in Angola—its fourth-largest goods export market—could suffer more than expected, should the latter’s growth prospects deteriorate due to low oil prices. Finally, the region-wide compression in bond spreads appears to be not strongly associated with country-specific economic fundamentals (see Box 2). Notwithstanding these concerns, given the recent speed and strength of market reaction to the QE announcement, growth and inflation may very well surprise on the upside in the short term. Authorities emphasized the role of largely permanent factors in spread compression. comprehensive European crisis backstop has successfully been put in place, and market participants now view the new arrangements as credible, though most expect a slightly larger spread differentiation than before the crisis. This favorable environment will raise growth in 2015 and 2016 above what had been expected only a few months ago. The authorities, however, expressed concern that low yields and compressed spreads could possibly lead to the accumulation of external imbalances in the future. The medium-term outlook is positive. Portugal’s external competitiveness has improved and the re-balancing between tradable and nontradable sector is well underway, as signified by both stronger employment and credit growth in the tradable sector, and the robust growth of exports. As a result, the economy will grow faster in the medium term, fueled by investment, the rising stock of human capital, and the continued strength of external demand. Even though the banking system still faces important challenges, the economic recovery (in tandem with a supportive monetary policy stance) should create supportive conditions for corporate and bank balance sheet repair.
