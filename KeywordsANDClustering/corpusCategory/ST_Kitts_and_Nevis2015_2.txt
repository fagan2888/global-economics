Near-term economic growth is set to continue, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. Growth is expected to slow to about 5 percent in 2015 and 3.5 percent in 2016, reflecting some moderation of construction activity; the output gap is estimated to close in 2015. The authorities are more bullish on growth, projecting a 7 percent increase in 2015, reflecting strong first quarter developments. Given considerable uncertainty related to the CBI program following the Canadian action and growing competition, staff is more cautious and assumes a substantial slowdown in the pace of inflows. Inflation is forecast to be negative 2.2 percent in 2015 as a result of the VAT exemptions on food items, which represent 25 percent of the consumer basket, and the decline in global commodity prices. Over the medium-term, staff projects growth to converge back to the regional average. The normalization of growth over 2017-2020 to 2.5 percent is based on the staff’s assumption of low CBI inflows, a tapering off in CBI-related Adjusting for the impact of the debt-land swap, the NPL ratio in 2014 is estimated to be 9 ½ percent, up from 8.9 percent in 2012.

This implies an average growth of 3.9 percent for 2013-2020, roughly the same as the pre-crisis average of 4 percent over 1991-2008, a period buffeted by negative exogenous shocks, including natural disasters. Risks to the outlook, highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex I), are broadly balanced. These include the potential fallout of the regional financial resolution process, vulnerability to natural disasters, and slower growth in advanced economies. On the upside, CBI and FDI inflows could be more buoyant than anticipated in the baseline. The external sustainability analysis suggests that the current account deficit is larger than implied by fundamentals, while the exchange rate is somewhat overvalued. The current account deficit is expected to deteriorate by about 5 percentage points to 12.6 percent in 2015 reflecting the staff’s cautious projection for CBI inflows for the rest of the year. Excluding CBI receipts, the current account balance remains broadly stable as higher good imports are offset by lower energy cost. Reserves are projected to fall reflecting planned debt repayment, but remain adequate, covering 8 months of imports in 2015. Competitiveness indicators – including the investment climate and tourism performance – suggest ongoing challenges (Annex II). The capacity to repay has substantially improved reflecting higher growth and advance repayments to the Fund, with outstanding Fund credit projected at end-2015 to be about 14 percent of imputed reserves compared to projection of 21 percent at the last review. St. Kitts and Nevis: Medium-Term Outlook Substantial measurement shortfalls in the balance of payment hinder accurate assessment. Outstanding 2015 obligations to the Fund have already been paid.
