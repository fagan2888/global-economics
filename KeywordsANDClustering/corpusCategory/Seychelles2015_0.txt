Seychelles is an upper middle-income country—the smallest in sub-Saharan Africa— successfully rebuilding resilience following a debt crisis in 2008-09. Per capita income has risen over time, bringing it close to the World Bank threshold for high income status. However, income inequality also appears to be high (as measured by the Gini coefficient). At the same time, absolute poverty appears to be low, and most economic and social indicators compare well to other microstates and advanced small island economies. In the aftermath of the 2008 balance of payments and debt crisis, the authorities enacted an extensive set of reforms that quickly restored fiscal and monetary credibility, with external support and Paris Club debt restructuring, and reduced the role of the state in the economy. Historically, growth has been driven largely by capital accumulation, with significant productivity gains evident primarily since 2008, when the reforms began (Annex 6). Presidential elections are due by May 2016 . Elections have been freely contested since the 1990s, although the ruling party candidate for president has won each election. In February 2015, President Michel announced his candidacy for re-election to a third and final term. Despite a cabinet reshuffle in January, the authorities have stressed continuity in economic policy, particularly the commitment to macroeconomic stability and the EFF-supported program. The authorities’ policies have largely aligned with advice from previous Article IV consultations. Fiscal policy has been appropriately tight to support continued reduction of the public debt, monetary and exchange rate policies have allowed for an increase in the build-up of foreign reserves, and Fund advice on mopping up the structural excess liquidity in the banking system has been followed, supporting an evolving and more forward-looking monetary policy framework. Structural reforms have also been implemented to improve the management of the public enterprises, including the introduction of a Public Enterprise Monitoring Commission (PEMC). Seychelles is a micro-state (i.e., population less than 200,000). While the overall area is 455 km , the population and economic activity are concentrated on three mostly mountainous islands totaling 203 km , comparable to the size of Washington, DC (177 km ). The 2006/7 household survey measured the Gini of income inequality at 65.8 percent: while the results from the 2013 household survey are still being analyzed, they are also expected to yield a relatively high level. Only 0.25 percent of the population was living on $1.25 or less a day in 2007. This measure may not be well adapted to Seychelles and the World Bank is assisting the authorities in estimating a poverty line using the 2013 household survey.
