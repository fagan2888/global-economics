The government approved an ambitious five-year national economic and social development plan (PNDES) in July 2016 (Box 1). Following two years of subdued growth (estimated at about 4 percent in 2014-15), the new government is under pressure to deliver rapid and tangible improvements in living standards. The plan’s total estimated cost is US$26 billion or 225 percent of 2016 GDP over 2016-20, of which over half or US$14.2 billion would be dedicated to priority investments. The authorities intend to seek official and private financing for a list of about 80 PNDES projects totaling US$10½ billion at a roundtable scheduled for December 7-8, 2016 in Paris. Box 1. Burkina Faso: The New National Development Strategy (PNDES) The government approved an ambitious five-year national economic and social development plan (PNDES) in July 2016. The plan aims at structurally transforming the Burkinabe economy, to achieve strong, sustainable resilient and inclusive growth that will create jobs and raise living standards. The plan is based on three strategic axes: (i) economic governance; (ii) human capital development; and (iii) structural transformation of the economy and private sector development. The plan aims at reaching a number of key objectives by 2020: Achieve annual growth rates of about 7.7 percent over 2016-200 and create 50,000 jobs per year. Reduce the poverty rate from 40.1 percent in 2014 to below 35 percent by 2020. Lower the population growth rate from 3.1 percent in 2006 to 2.7 percent by 2020. percent of 2016 GDP Strategic Axes and Objectives Reform Institutions and Modernize the State Plan for Social and Economic Development, 2016-20 The PNDES envisages that public investment would increase from 9 to 17 percent of GDP in 2017 and remain elevated thereafter . The plan thus Box 1 Table 1. Burkina Faso: Priority Investments in the National foresees a rapid increase in growth, to 8.4 percent in 2017, under optimistic assumptions for mining and agricultural production, and remaining above 8 percent through 2019, well above the 2003-13 historical average of 6.1 percent. The increase in investment spending would also result in a significant widening of the fiscal deficit, to 7 percent of GDP on average in 2017-19. The debt- to-GDP ratio would rise by 10 percentage points of GDP, to 43.9 percent of GDP by 2019, which would not be consistent with medium-term debt sustainability. The plan’s priority investment projects are heavily tilted towards physical infrastructure, mainly energy, road and water management (Box 1 Table 1). Energy projects account for over a quarter of the total cost, followed by road and water and sanitation. Lack of adequate electricity supply is a major growth bottleneck and funding this key sector is essential to unlock the country’s growth potential.

On October 8 the security forces foiled a coup attempt by former presidential guard soldiers who were also aiming to free the leaders of the September 2015 coup. Sporadic terrorist attacks at the borders with Mali and Niger continue. In response, the authorities are stepping up security. BURKINA FASO (% y/y) Jun. 2013 - Sept.2016 Text Figure 1. Burkina Faso: Private Sector Credit and Money Supply Growth, Economic activity has started to rebound in the second quarter of 2016. The January terrorist attacks and the delays in approving the 2016 budget weighed on activity in Q1 but output rebounded at 8.3 percent in Q2 (y/y). Real GDP growth is now projected at 5.4 percent for the year. The recovery is led by services (+11.3 percent), and followed by the secondary sector (+4.8 percent), boosted by the onset of production of two new gold mines. Abundant rainfall is expected to lead to a sharp rebound in agricultural output in late 2016-early 2017 after three disappointing years. Inflation continued to decline, to 0.4 percent at end-September (y/y), driven by transport and energy prices, and is expected to remain subdued at 0.6 percent in at end-year (Figure 1, Table 1). Private sector credit growth reached its lowest level in years at 3.9 percent in April (y/y), and has since only slowly picked up, reaching 6.3 percent in September. At the same time, banks’ holdings of net foreign assets increased by 43 percent as of July 2016 (y/y), resulting in broadly stable money growth during the period. (Text Figure 1, Table 3, MEFP ¶2).

Revenue collection was on target overall, though internet outages during the third quarter led to a sharp decline in customs revenue, which were 4 percent below target as of end- September, following a very strong first half of the year. Recurrent spending ran slightly above budget, owing to an additional CFAF 26 billion in expenses related to the implementation of the new civil servants’ employment framework and other public sector wage agreements (MEFP ¶18). The 2016 budget was Text Figure 2.

Page 12 revised a second time in July 2016 to include about 1 percentage point of GDP in additional revenue compared with the program. About half of this increase was due to one-off dividend payments from the state-owned hydrocarbon importer, SONABHY, and the remainder was reflected in a lower deficit. Public investment budget execution stood at only 50 percent as of end-September despite an acceleration in the pace of execution (Text Figure 2). The overall 2016 deficit is now projected at 2.5 percent of GDP, compared with 3 percent of GDP at the time of the 4 ECF review (Figure 3, Tables 2a-2b, MEFP ¶19). The current account deficit is projected to narrow only slightly from 8 to 7.7 percent of GDP, given large intermediary goods’ imports . Ongoing mining construction and higher public investment are expected to lead to a 7.9 percent increase in imports in 2016, only partially offset by the increased values of gold exports resulting from the recovery in gold prices. Mining investment and the return to political stability are also driving a projected rebound in FDI inflows, to 2.5 percent of GDP compared with 2 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 2, Table 4, MEFP ¶2). Program performance remains strong. All continuous and end-June quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets were met, most by wide margins. Non-concessional borrowing amounted to CFAF 205 billion in June and is expected to reach CFAF 229 billion by end-December, close to the CFAF 230 billion program ceiling (Appendix Table 1, MEFP ¶5). Six end-June structural benchmarks (SBs) were met on time, and one was implemented with delay (transmission of quarterly financial accounts of the hydrocarbon company, SONABHY). Progress is being made on the final SB, implementation of standardized VAT invoicing for large and medium enterprises, and it is expected to be implemented by January 1 st , 2017 (MEFP ¶5). The July benchmark to transfer CFAF 5 billion in windfall profits from SONABHY to the state electricity utility (SONABEL) was met, and the authorities have completed in advance the second transfer of CFAF 35 billion from SONABHY to SONABEL, thereby clearing CFAF 40 billion in arrears, out of a total of CFAF 66 billion. The authorities have requested to reprogram the November benchmark on control of fuel losses during transport owing to delays in securing the electronic tracking equipment. The bolting of manholes on all trucks and installation of seals and electronic tracking equipment along the Benin and Niger corridor will be implemented by December 2016, with the full deployment to be finalized in the first quarter of 2017 (Appendix Tables 2-3, MEFP ¶6).
