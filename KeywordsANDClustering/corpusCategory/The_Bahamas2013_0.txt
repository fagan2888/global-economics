Economic activity continues to recover from the global financial crisis, but at a slow pace. The fiscal situation deteriorated in FY2012/13, mainly due to customs revenue underperformance. Reflecting weak tourism receipts, the external current account deficit increased further, adding to pressures on reserve adequacy. While private sector deleveraging continues, the financial sector appears sound. Growth remains tepid. Real GDP grew by 1.8 percent in 2012, similar to 2011, and well below pre-global-crisis performance (Table 1 and Figure 1). Investment, led by construction of the US$3.5 billion Baha Mar tourist resort project, grew by 20.6 percent, but private consumption (70 percent of GDP) declined for the fifth consecutive year. Tourism receipts—the bulk of exports— have been weaker than expected, partly reflecting Hurricane Sandy in late 2012 and early 2013, but also owing to persistent softness in the high value-added stopover segment, a temporary loss in hotel room inventory , and increased competition from low-cost regional destinations. In 2013 growth in tourism visitors declined to 2.3 percent for the first nine months, from 8.3 percent in 2012, and preliminary data indicate that hotel receipts fell 7½ percent in January–September. However, increased construction at Baha Mar has helped support activity. Inflation has eased from 2 percent in 2012 to an average of 0.3 percent for January–October 2013, in keeping with anemic activity and softening fuel prices. Against a background of broadly subdued activity, unemployment rose to 16.2 percent in mid-2013.

The fiscal situation deteriorated further in FY2012/13 (Tables 2–4 and Figure 2) Revenue underperformed, mainly owing to slower-than-expected economic recovery and lower customs revenues, while current spending, especially on wages and goods and services, remained elevated at a time of general elections. Reflecting these developments, the fiscal deficit widened to 5½ percent of GDP. Further, the authorities contracted in late 2012 a US$180 million (2.2 percent of GDP) external loan to stem the decline of foreign reserves, and central government debt rose to 56 percent of GDP (49 percent in FY2011/12). About seven large hotels have undertaken some degree of renovation constraining inventory in 2013. Also, the refurbishment of the 694-room Melia Nassau Beach Resort is to commence shortly. Page 6 The current account deficit increased further in 2012 and 2013, pressuring reserve adequacy. The deficit reached 17½ percent of GDP in 2012, up from 13½ percent in 2011, largely driven by an increase of goods and services imports related to Baha Mar (Table 5). From a saving/investment perspective, an increase in the investment/GDP ratio by 5 percentage points to 33 percent of GDP in 2012 outpaced a small increase in the saving ratio (Figure 4). Data indicate that the current account imbalance has increased in 2013 owing to weakened tourism and on-going construction of Baha Mar, with foreign reserves declining to $685 million in October from $810 million at end-2012. Credit growth has slowed markedly in recent years (Table 6). The economic downturn in the wake of the global financial crisis led to a near doubling of non-performing loans (NPLs). Private sector credit has stalled since 2009 as banks tightened lending standards and debtors deleveraged. In the face of declining profit margins, banks have increased their interest rate spreads, largely through cutting deposit rates. The financial sector is otherwise in good overall standing.
