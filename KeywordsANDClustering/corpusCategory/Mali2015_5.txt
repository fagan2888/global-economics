An external stability assessment suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but structural competitiveness needs to improve (Annex I). Since the events of 2011–13, Mali’s balance of payments has been dominated by flows relating to external security assistance, with weak export performance due to declines in the world gold price. However, the recent drop in the world oil price, together with high levels of aid, is expected to lead to a temporary improvement in the current account balance in 2015. While the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with Mali’s fundamentals, medium-term improvements in structural competitiveness are essential to enable Mali to raise economic growth, diversify its exports away from gold and contribute to safeguarding external stability of the zone (see paragraphs 14–15, in Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper). Qualitative competitiveness indicators point to significant structural bottlenecks, a challenging business environment and weak governance, implying a large scope for improvement. Mali is assessed to be at a moderate risk of debt distress—unchanged from the previous DSA. (See accompanying DSA Supplement) Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to a tightening of financial terms, underscoring the importance for the Malian government of continuing to meet its external financing needs with grants and concessional loans, wherever possible. Debt indicators are also vulnerable to a reduction in transfers and foreign direct investment and an export shock stemming from the concentration of exports in gold. Page 19
