For sustained long-term growth, a sound financial system that is squarely focused on intermediating savings to productive private sector uses will be essential. Over the past decades, the financial system has focused too much on diverting resources to the public sector. This has come at the cost of crowding out financing for productive, growth enhancing investment as illustrated by a stock of credit to the private sector that is low, at 22 percent of GDP, and well below regional comparators (Figure 3). Beyond the planned fiscal consolidation, the recent establishment of two credit bureaus and the creation of a central collateral registry should help develop the credit market over the medium term. The draft Banking Services legislation marks an important step forward in creating a safer banking system (MEFP ¶27). The bill harmonizes prudential standards across deposit-taking Referred to as the Omnibus Banking Act in Country Report No. 14/85. Page 19 institutions, facilitates the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, strengthens the corrective action and sanctioning regime, and promotes the BOJ’s operational independence in its supervision function. However, further steps are still needed, to put in place a comprehensive crisis management and resolution framework for banks (and other financial firms) as well as create full operational independence of the supervisors. Heavy exposure to sovereign debt remains the central risk for the financial system. Government instruments accounted for less than 20 percent of banks’ assets at end-2013 and the 2013 debt exchange imposed direct income and fair value losses on banks, through cuts in coupons and maturity extensions. Such risks are even more apparent for the securities dealers, which hold about 58 percent of their assets in the form of government bonds. Furthermore, there are important linkages between banks and securities dealers that create channels for contagion. The drying up of secondary markets in government paper and the tightening of financial market liquidity more generally, have heightened systemic liquidity risks. At the same time, once the bond market re-liquefies, there is a good chance that the sovereign yield curve will shift upwards and lead to capital losses for a range of financial companies. Careful sequencing will, therefore, be needed to unfreeze the secondary bond market. Beyond the impact on financial sector risks, the lack of liquidity has added to the government’s cash management and overall financing constraints, undermined effective monetary transmission, and reduced the provision of credit to the private sector. The market may restart naturally as confidence in the success of the program deepens. However, in the absence of a market-driven unfreezing of the secondary bond market, options for restarting the bond market through policy actions should still be considered. The BOJ could, for example, start to offer to purchase securities via open market operations through variable rate auctions (with a minimum bid price) that would begin with shorter maturity bonds and then gradually moving further out the curve. This would help with price discovery and perhaps catalyze activity between financial institutions in the secondary market. Reform of the securities dealers is essential for financial stability. Securities dealers, with total assets of about 40 percent of GDP, finance long-term government bonds with short-term, deposit-like investments (“retail repos”). This model entails significant interest rate, liquidity, and concentration risks, which are not matched by either capital or liquidity buffers. To mitigate these risks and provide better protection to retail investors, a multi-step reform process has commenced (MEFP ¶28–31). First, at end-2013, collective investment schemes (CIS) were made available, in which Jamaica: Financial Sector Indicators 1/ (In percent) 2007200820092010201120122013Feb-14 Balance sheet growth (y/y) Capital11.514.713.85.15.44.217.119.9Loans28.724.25.3-1.44.812.914.111.9NPLs14.257.668.036.144.0-10.8-12.9-16.2 Liquidity Excess liquidity 2/25.030.331.336.230.526.725.326.2 Asset Quality Prov. for loan losses/NPLs103.487.275.769.975.290.395.797.7NPLs/loans2.32.94.76.58.97.05.44.8 Capital Adequacy NPLs/Capital+Prov. for loan losses9.112.317.722.328.424.118.816.7Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) 3/16.015.218.818.216.114.115.115.1 Profitability (calendar year) 4/ Pre-tax profit margin26.726.221.421.130.821.419.0…Return on average assets3.43.52.92.53.92.42.0…Source: Bank of Jamaica.1/ Commercial banks, building societies, and merchant banks.2/ Statutory liquid assets/prescribed liabilities.3/ If not end-quarter, data corresponds to last quarter.4/ The significant increase in profitability for 2011 is due to an up-stream dividend from one insurancesubsidiary to its parent bank.

Second, by end-2014 the government intends to introduce a new legal and regulatory framework to better protect clients’ interests through standardized and more transparent retail repo instruments. This new framework will be implemented over time. The final phase of this reform will involve a gradual tightening of prudential requirements to reflect underlying risks and incentivize a market-based shift to alternative, better regulated, and legally sound investment products. Implementing this reform will need to be done carefully and will need to be preconditioned on: (i) the introduction of credible exceptional financial backstops, at the discretion of the BOJ, to bolster financial sector stability and (ii) a detailed assessments of securities dealers’ readiness to move to a new framework; while also taking into account the liquidity conditions of the secondary government bond market.
