Driven by domestic demand, the economy grew briskly in 2013. Output expanded at 2.0 percent in 2013, up from 1 percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Private consumption continued to grow steadily as wage increases and negative inflation raised real disposable income; construction saw a strong rebound, while an improving external environment turned the external sector’s contribution to growth to positive. The lagged effects of the 2012 slowdown pushed the unemployment rate up to 3.2 percent, still low in international comparison. Labor supply was boosted by net immigration of some 1 percent of the population, the highest since 2008. Page 6 After two years of deflation, price growth is hovering around zero. As the pass-through from past exchange rate appreciation has abated, negative inflation from foreign goods and services has been offset by positive inflation from domestic goods and services. Inflation expectations (measured by consensus forecasts) have come down somewhat but are still well anchored in positive territory. CHF/EUR appreciation since April 2013 A significant and sustained net reversal of safe haven capital inflows has not occurred, including because of intermittent waves of global financial turbulence. The reduction in euro area tail risks, accompanied by nascent signs of a Europe-wide recovery, allowed the franc to trade in a 1.22–1.25 band relative to the euro during July 2012–April 2013, somewhat above the 1.2 floor. However, since then, global volatility surges around the announced and actual normalization of U.S. monetary policy, as well as recent EM turmoil and market jitters related to the political crisis in Ukraine, saw the franc appreciate against the euro and trade closer to the floor once again (Annex 1 and Figure 2). The SNB’s balance sheet has remained elevated at around 80 percent of GDP, well above levels observed for other advanced economies with the exception of Hong Kong and Singapore. b F b F
