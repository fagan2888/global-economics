Sweden’s robust growth is reducing unemployment and raising resource utilization (Figure 1). Excluding volatile items within services exports, GDP growth was very strong at 4 percent y/y in the first half of 2016, on the heels of 3.7 percent growth in Domestic demand is the key driver, with the 4.7 percent y/y rise in 2016 H1 underpinned by high private investment growth, especially new dwelling construction, and by solid growth in private and public consumption. Export growth moderated to just over 4 percent, still performing well in relation to the modest growth of trading partners. Employment gains of 1.5 percent y/y helped bring trend unemployment down to 7 percent in August from around 8 percent in 2011–14. Survey indicators and output gap estimates point to a rise in resource utilization to just above normal levels. However, the progress in addressing Sweden’s three main economic challenges is mixed, as elaborated in the remainder of this section: Integration of migrants Refugee inflows have declined markedly in 2016, but administrative capacity is stretched, impeding their progress toward integration into the labor force. House prices and household debt Housing price increases have slowed, yet the share of households taking on high debt relative to income continues to rise. Low inflation Strong monetary policy efforts have helped to raise inflation expectations significantly, but core HICP inflation has stabilized at about 1.2 percent for the past year. A spike in exports of research and development and royalties and license fees in 2015:H2 contributed about 0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in 2015, even though these items were only 2 percent of GDP in 2014.

Resource Utilization & & Q = Page 10 Migration inflows have subsided after last year’s historic surge, but there are significant hurdles to integrating the large stock of asylum seekers. Almost 163,000 people (1¾ percent of the population) sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, with just over one-fifth being unaccompanied minors, notably higher than in previous migration waves. These inflows dropped to just over 15,000 in the first half of 2016, mostly due to external developments, but Sweden has also temporarily introduced border controls and tightened rules for asylum seekers. As a result, the Swedish Migration Agency (SMA) has revised down its forecast to between 30,000 and 50,000 asylum seekers this year. Nonetheless, the large stock of asylum seekers with pending applications for residence permits is straining Sweden’s reception capacity and impediments beyond the asylum period may slow their integration into the labor market and Swedish society (Box 1). House price increases have slowed significantly but household debt is steadily rising. Housing price inflation declined to about 5 percent annualized in the last 10 months, from around 15 percent for most of 2015. Stockholm apartment prices have been broadly flat since September 2015, after jumping by 54 percent in the three preceding years. This slowing may reflect the high level housing prices reached in the Fall of 2015, renewed public discussion of reducing tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments, and some anticipation of the impact of minimum amortization requirements on new mortgages that became effective in mid-2016. Even as prices slowed, household credit growth was little changed in the past year, running at 7.5 percent y/y in August, bringing household debt to 179 percent of disposable income, rising steadily by 11 percentage points in the past three years, as new housing purchasers take on higher debts. il cc All dwellings Apartments Credit to households House Price and Household Credit (Y/Y percent change) Sources: Statistics Sweden, Valueguard, and Fund staff calculations. 51015202530354045Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec. 2016Sources: Eurostat and Fund staff calculations. Asylum Applicants to Sweden (Thousands) Page 11 Inflation and inflation expectations have risen significantly from low levels, although core inflation has stabilized more recently . Sweden’s output gap widened to 2½ percent in 2013, contributing to core HICP inflation falling to just ½ percent in 2013–14, below the 1.1 percent rate in the euro area. Core inflation rose to an average of 1.1 percent in 2015, with depreciation of the Swedish krona in 2014 playing a significant role. This progress, together with the Riksbank’s strong commitment to its inflation target, underpinned a rebound in inflation expectations from their record lows in early 2015. Nonetheless, the wage round in 2016 (covering about 80 percent of private sector employees), agreed wage growth of only 2.2 percent, below the historical average despite labor market tightening. Core inflation has since picked up only marginally, to average 1.2 percent so far in 2016, which may contribute to expectations leveling out in recent months.
