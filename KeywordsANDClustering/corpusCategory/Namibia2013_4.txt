The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook, and prospects but emphasized that Namibia’s growth remains above the world average. They acknowledged the need to pursue a “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation plan and contain the size of wage bill in a manner that gives priority to job creation and reduce inequality. This year’s consultation focused on four main themes: (i) responding to inward spillovers from the current global downturn and policy uncertainty in South Africa; (ii) rebuilding fiscal policy buffers: prudent fiscal and wage policies to strengthen external sustainability and reduce unemployment; (iii) promoting financial inclusion and stability; and (iv) reinvigorating growth and enhancing export diversification.
