Sustaining the current high levels of growth over the medium term and reducing vulnerabilities requires additional policy efforts. Spain has rebounded strongly and employment is increasing. However, the level of unemployment is still painfully high and domestic and external vulnerabilities remain.

Continued strengthening of banks will ensure they support growth as credit demand recovers. Anchoring confidence .
