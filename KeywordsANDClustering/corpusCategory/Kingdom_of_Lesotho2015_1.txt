Lesotho faces a challenging near- and medium-term economic outlook. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen to about 2½ percent in 2015 and is projected to remain subdued in 2016, mainly reflecting weaknesses in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Uncertainty about Lesotho’s favored access to the U.S. market and an increasingly competitive global Page 12 environment have dampened production of textiles, Lesotho’s leading manufacturing export, while construction activity has stalled from lower investment spending by both the public and private sectors. Over the medium term, the underlying weakness in the economy is expected to persist, as a sharp and prolonged decline in SACU revenues will necessitate a major fiscal adjustment that would curtail government demand. Nevertheless, GDP growth is expected to get a boost from the coming on line of a large new diamond mine in 2017 and, in the following year, commencement of construction on phase two of the water transfer component of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP-II). Annual inflation is projected to be around 5 percent over the medium term—in line with South Africa’s inflation projections. Currently, inflation is still low (4.4 percent as of October 2015), despite sharp increases in food prices. Exchange rate depreciation could add to inflation pressures, although for the time being, low international fuel prices have softened the impact for Lesotho. There are several risks to this outlook—most notably, there could be severe consequences if fiscal adjustment is not implemented in a timely manner. Without an appropriate adjustment, the magnitude and duration of the drop in SACU revenues would lead to unsustainable fiscal deficits, which would jeopardize debt sustainability and the maintenance of international reserves needed to ensure the loti’s parity with the rand under the CMA (Box 2). Other significant risks include: (i) spillover effects if emerging market countries, and especially South Africa, experience a prolonged and more severe slowdown in growth than is currently projected; (ii) diminished competitiveness if new trade agreements do indeed cut into Lesotho’s relatively favorable access to export markets; and (iii) the prospects of severe drought in the region (Table 7). To some extent, Lesotho’s current stock of international reserves mitigates these risks, by providing a cushion against most temporary shocks. The reserves, along with fiscal buffers, would also allow time for an orderly adjustment to more permanent shocks, such as the loss of SACU revenues in the baseline scenario. Finally, while the risks are to the downside, there are also potential upsides to the baseline, notably if Lesotho’s policy framework garners greater support from development partners. In the baseline scenario, textile exports are projected to remain flat due to uncertainty surrounding Lesotho’s trade preferences. Total exports dip in 2015/16, mainly because of a temporary drop in production at a major diamond mine. The baseline scenario does not incorporate any grants under a possible second compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation or budget support from other development partners. Page 13 Box 2. Downside Scenario Delaying or not fully implementing additional fiscal measures as outlined in the baseline scenario could still threaten macroeconomic stability. As an example, an illustrative downside scenario with fiscal measures that achieve permanent fiscal gains of 1 percent of GDP a year from 2016/17 to 2018/19 (cumulative gain of 3 percent of GDP by 2018/19) would lead to a substantial increase in domestic debt and lower in international reserves. Assuming that the financing of additional fiscal needs is accomplished through the combination of issuance of government securities and running down the government deposits at CBL, by the end of the medium-term projection period (2019/20) international reserves would fall to about 4 months of import coverage and total public debt would reach 60 percent of GDP. In addition, the increased government borrowing leads to some crowding out of credit to the private sector, which negatively affects GDP growth. DOWNSIDE SCENARIO Act. Act. Prel.
