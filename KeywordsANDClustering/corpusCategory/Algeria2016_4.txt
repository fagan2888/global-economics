The discussion focused on the policy response to the oil price shock, given short and medium-term objectives . Addressing the large external shock will involve difficult choices. On the one hand, the authorities must restore fiscal sustainability, reduce external vulnerabilities, contain inflation, and preserve financial stability. On the other hand, they need to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil, boost medium-term growth potential and create jobs, and maintain social stability and cohesiveness. The consultation explored the policy choices that these multiple objectives involve, in a difficult external environment. The mission argued that the magnitude and durability of the external shock call for a vigorous policy response built on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Algeria, whose fiscal policy was already unsustainable when oil prices were high, needs to undertake ambitious and sustained consolidation combined with a critical mass of structural reforms to diversify its economy and promote private sector-led growth and job creation. Greater exchange rate flexibility should support these efforts, while monetary policy should guard against inflationary pressures and financial policies need to address rising risks in the financial sector. Existing buffers allow for an orderly adjustment, but action should start now on many fronts, as reforms will take time to bear fruit while buffers will continue to erode. The authorities agreed with the broad strategy laid out by the mission but occasionally differed on its specific translation into concrete actions. They are also concerned about how fast the adjustment can be implemented. Staff remains ready to support the authorities’ efforts though close dialogue on policy options and technical assistance.
