Near-term economic prospects are poor—with a recession projected in 2016. Under current policies, real GDP is expected to contract by -2.4 percent in 2016, and hover around 1-2 percent in the next few years, while inflation is expected to gradually fall under 8 percent. Large fiscal surpluses during the oil boom years are projected to turn into deficits in 2015-18. The current account balance should improve as the devaluations work to limit imports and support non-traditional exports. The authorities plan to utilize about $500 million in SOFAZ assets in 2016 to help finance balance of payments gaps. Macro-financial risks to the outlook are substantial (Appendix I). Given the economy’s HC export structure and public investment framework, oil price shocks have a strong impact on the real economy, with spillover effects on the ER, bank profitability, and credit delivery systems (Box 2). Macro-financial linkages have increased significantly over time, through rapid growth in bank credit during the oil boom years—notably to the household and construction sectors. (Box 3) . Dollarization—which increases vulnerabilities to liquidity and solvency shocks—has expanded. Weak bank capital and liquidity positions are also weighing on credit activity. While the authorities are making progress in cleaning up the banking system at a difficult juncture, the bank restructuring strategy entails important risks —notably the decision to inject substantial new resources into IBA—a large systemic public bank with a weak track record and a continued lending focus on oil-related industrial projects. Staff projections seek to incorporate these financial sector risks. So far, bank closures have been handled effectively and have occurred without provoking destabilizing deposit runs. In mid-2016, household deposits amounted to some 14 percent of projected 2016 GDP. The Board will include representatives of deposit insurance fund (ADIF), CBA, MOF, FMSA, and SOFAZ, and will be chaired by the Prime Minister. Page 14 Deposit growth, which declined during the devaluations, has rebounded (due in part to the blanket guarantee), helping to support bank funding. Downgrades by international rating agencies have had little impact given limited dependence on external credit lines. Negative financial accelerator effects and increases in dollarization rates experienced in 2015-16, are assumed to reverse gradually as oil prices are expected to improve over the forecast period and as banking sector reform progresses. Staff’s growth and private credit forecasts for 2016-2020 average 1.3 and 6.0 percent, respectively, well below historical averages and imply a relatively slow recovery. Overall, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Additional oil price declines associated with a deteriorating global outlook would worsen external balances, increase ER pressures, expose fiscal vulnerabilities and further dent consumer and business confidence. Budgetary transfers from SOFAZ would diminish resulting in further spending cuts or larger fiscal deficits, which may require drawdowns from SOFAZ’s stock of assets. Direct exposure to international financial markets is concentrated mostly on Oil Fund assets held abroad. As demonstrated above, complications in the bank restructuring process could also impact growth. Better than expected oil price developments constitute the main upside risk. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s macroeconomic projections and hold similar views on the risk outlook. Page 15 Box 2.

Oil profits are a key part of factor income, a share of which get reinvested in FDI by the consortium of foreign oil companies which is developing Azerbaijan’s oil fields. Given the ad hoc fiscal rule, a portion of these profits were used to build up sovereign wealth fund (SOFAZ) buffers and recycled throughout the economy via budgetary transfers for public investments. Oil price shocks also put pressure on exchange rates and reserves and creating income/wealth and confidence effects, and affect financial intermediation. Public investment is the main transmitting mechanism between the oil and non-oil sectors in Azerbaijan. An estimated vector auto regression (VAR) model using annual data from 1997 to 2015 shows that, net of public investment, the impact of trading partner growth on non-oil sector is negligible. Public investment and oil prices, however, explain the majority of variance in the non-oil growth rates, especially over the medium term. While direct external linkages to the financial sector are small, indirect linkages have been substantial. Azerbaijan’s financing needs have been low by international standards, given external and fiscal surpluses. Lending by global banks to Azerbaijan’s financial sector has been minimal and corporations have relied mainly on their own resources. FDI, focused on the energy sector, remained strong due to new gas developments. However, the oil price-led devaluations have weakened the domestic banking system and raised the risk premium for Azerbaijan when borrowing in international markets. As a consequence, financing the new gas pipeline project faced higher costs as reflected in the yield of the 10-year bond issued in mid-March 2016.

Azerbaijan: Macro-Financial Linkages Oil and ER shocks have led to a rise in dollarization levels. Dollarization in Azerbaijan had fallen from 2002 to 2014, with a minor setback at the start of the financial crisis in 2008. It appears to move in line with oil prices, a key propagator of the business cycle (BC) in Azerbaijan. Starting from a very low base, bank credit has expanded rapidly over the last decade. Two separate growth phases—first from 2005-10, and a second dramatic acceleration in credit activity in 2011-15—appear to have occurred. The main growth sectors were in trade, construction, households and industry—with trade credit expanding at a slower rate in the second period and construction, industry and household credit surging.

Sources: CBA and Staff estimates. Azerbaijan: Credit by Sector (in percent of Non-Oil GDP) Total credit as a percent of non-oil GDP has almost tripled , going from 23 percent in 2005 to 63 percent by 2015. Over the same period, credit to households has increased from 6½ to 24½ percent of non-oil GDP, while credit to the construction sector has increased from 1½ to 9 percent of non-oil GDP. Mortgages have been a key component of the growth in household credit (now 4½ of non-oil GDP), with the remaining 20 percent stemming from consumer oriented lending (e.g., credit cards, auto loans and home appliances). Sectoral credit gaps and BCs do not fully co-move together. The “credit gap”, defined as the difference between a credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend, reflects a financial cycle (FC). The last 3 BCs (trough-to-trough) were in 2001-05, 2005-09 and 2009-2016. In comparison, sectoral credit gaps appear to be more diverse with little movement during the first BC. Corporate and trade FCs appear to co-move and lag a bit the second BC. In the last BC, household, trade and construction FC respond sharply during the boom. Sources: CBA and IMF staff estimates.

Fitted values for non-oil growth Construction and real estate Industry Non-oil growth Non-oil growth Non-oil growth Non-oil growth Azerbaijan: Credit and Non-Oil Growth Regressions 1/ Two sets of regressions are estimated to find evidence of a macro-financial linkage. One set focuses on credit regressions, looking to see how BCs affect the credit market. The other focus is on growth regressions, using individual sectoral credit growth or FCs to ascertain the impact of credit developments on real activity. A loan to deposit leverage ratio and oil price growth are used as financial and real sector conditioning variables. The data is quarterly (2006q1-2016q2). Regression results which found significant macro- financial linkages are reported below. They indicate that construction and industry credit growth are affected by non-oil growth, while growth in trade, construction, and household credit impact non-oil growth. For example, a one percentage point increase in overall credit growth is found to increase growth by 0.15 percent. At the same time, a one percentage point change in non-oil growth is related to an expansion in construction and industry credit growth by about 3½ and 2¾ percent, respectively.
