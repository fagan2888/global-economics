The international and regional contexts have dramatically changed since the mid-2014 consultation. So far, Cameroon has weathered the twin shocks of the oil price slump and security threats, but pressure is building. Continued robust growth in 2014–15 reflected strong domestic demand driven by accelerated public investment. This, in turn, has increased the fiscal deficits and the debt burden. Social indicators continue to lag the authorities’ aim to become an emerging economy in the next 20 years. Cameroon suffered two major shocks in 2014. First the international crude oil price slump has reduced government revenue and exports, although the shock was significantly smaller than for other Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) countries. Second, the surge of terrorist attacks in the Lake Chad region has disrupted economic activity in Cameroon’s extreme north, which has required large-scale, multinational military operations in response. These operations have succeeded in reducing the number and severity of the attacks in Cameroon. Cameroon extended its record of robust growth in 2014. Growth reached 5.9 percent, buoyed by increased oil production and the performance of sectors benefiting from the public investment boom: building materials, construction, and energy (Text Table 1; Figures 1–2; Tables 1 and 4–5). A major infrastructure project (“ grand projet structurant ”), the Kribi deep-sea port, is nearing completion. Annual inflation remained below 2 percent, despite a 15 percent gasoline retail price increase on July 1, 2014, and was slightly higher than inflation in the euro area. The authorities heeded long-standing staff advice on gasoline price adjustment and on tax administration reform, but other policy and technical assistance recommendations have not been implemented (Annex I). Figure 1. Cameroon: Real GDP by Sector, 2014 The port’s construction was completed in mid-2014, but the port is not yet operational because of the lack of appropriate electricity and water provision and other services.

Cameroon: Selected Economic Indicators, 2010–15 Real GDP Growth CPI Change Capital Expenditure Overall Fiscal Balance External Current Account Public Debt Page 12 Growth in 2015 is projected at almost 6 percent, supported by a surge in oil production and a further increase in public investment. This contrasts with the projected growth rate of about 2 percent for CEMAC. Oil extraction is expected to rise by almost 25 percent, as new wells come on stream (Figure 3). Inflation is projected to increase to almost 3 percent, as second-round effects of the mid-2014 fuel price increase work their way through food and transport prices. Structural competitiveness issues, including an unpropitious business climate and lack of progress in regional integration, will continue to hamper private sector development, leading to a medium-term growth rate of about 5 percent. Figure 3. Cameroon: Selected Oil Sector Indicators, 2009–20 Fiscal performance deteriorated in 2014. The fiscal deficit, on a cash basis and including grants, widened to 4.8 percent of GDP, as the increase in revenue lagged that in expenditure (Tables 2–3 and 6–9). This outturn would have been worse, were it not for the a 15 percent increase in retail fuel prices in mid-2014, which helped contain subsidies, as oil prices reached more than US$110 per barrel. Efficiency improvements helped non-oil revenue increase by almost one percentage point of GDP from 2013, thanks to strong direct taxes and customs income. Conversely, oil revenue dropped half a percentage point of GDP from 2013, as declining royalties reflected the oil price slump in the second half of the year. Expenditure was driven by public investment (up by 1.1 percentage points of GDP over 2013) and current expenditure, notably fuel subsidies (2.3 percent of GDP on an accrual basis), despite the mid-year price increase. The stock or arrears remained stable at 4.6 percent of GDP at end-2014, reflecting an increase in arrears to fuel distributors, and a decrease in unsettled payment obligations.

Page 13 The medium-term fiscal outlook is threatened by the deteriorating global and regional environments and expanding public investment. Lower oil prices are expected to reduce fuel subsidies by 1.2 percentage points of GDP in 2015, but also to cut a comparable amount from oil revenue. Security operations in the extreme north are expected to drive public expenditure up in 2015 and beyond. New infrastructure projects to accelerate development and revitalize the extreme north are projected to push capital spending to 10 percent of GDP in 2016. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to peak at over 7 percent of GDP in 2016. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is projected to follow a similar trend as a percentage of non-oil GDP. Reflecting, inter alia, these fiscal developments, the government’s net worth is projected to decline in the medium term (Box 1). Poverty remains high according to the preliminary results of the 2014 household survey. Although poverty fell by two percentage points between 2007 and 2014 to 37.5 percent of the population, its level is comparable to that of a low-income country (Text Table 2 and Table 14). Its geographical incidence is uneven. Poverty increased in the northern-most regions, where livelihoods are more dependent on agriculture. Moreover, gender-related social indicators deteriorated, such as maternal mortality and female illiteracy. Social expenditure allocations in 2014 remained constrained by high fuel subsidies, in spite of the gasoline price increase. Although the oil price collapse has reduced the level of fuel subsidies in 2015 to a projected 0.2 percent of GDP, security threats in the extreme north have entailed rising expenditure, thus limiting allocations to the social sectors. According to the World Development Indicators, Senegal’s latest reported poverty rate was 38.0 percent and Uganda’s was 33.2 percent. 200720112014Poverty39.938.737.5Urban poverty 12.210.88.9Rural poverty 5559.256.8Population growth2.62.52.5Life expectancy at birth (years)525455Maternal mortality ratio (per 100.000 live births)720690782Youth literacy rate8381N/A Sources: World Bank World Development Indicators; Cameroonian authorities; and IMF staff estimates Text Table 2. Cameroon: Selected Social Indicators, 2007–14 (Percent, unless otherwise indicated) Page 14 Box 1. Cameroon: Government Balance Sheet Increasing liabilities and stagnating assets are projected to reduce the government’s net worth by 31 percent in nominal terms between 2013 and 2020. The Box Table shows that despite the projected steady increase in public capital stock, as a result of sustained public investment, total government assets will stagnate in nominal terms because of a 38 percent decline in the value of oil reserves between 2013 and 2020. This significant fall is due to the depletion of oil reserves (from 230 million barrels in 2015) and low oil price projections. The overall stability of assets is more than offset by a threefold increase in liabilities, reflecting the increase in public debt to finance public investment. The large increase in debt is the result, inter alia, of the higher cost of non-concessional borrowing. It may also be related to low factor productivity (Box 2). Cameroon’s public capital stock has been calculated using the permanent inventory method of growth accounting exercises. Based on the literature on public capital stock (e.g., Kamps, 2004; Arestoff and Hurlin, 2006; Alrlanalp, Bohorts and Gupta 2011), Cameroon’s estimates appear to be relatively conservative. With current large borrowing plans and lower oil exports, Cameroon’s risk of external debt distress has risen from “low” to “high” in the space of less than three years. Public debt is projected to reach more than 42 percent of GDP by 2020, more than twice its level at end-2013, while debt service is also expected to double in the medium term. The rapid increase in external debt, the mostly non-concessional terms of new loans, and the fall in the value of Cameroon’s main exports are the main factors, which explain the breach of the threshold for the ratio of the present value of external debt to exports in 2021 (Figure 4 and companion debt sustainability analysis). The breach is significant—the ratio nears 130 versus a threshold of 100—and is projected to last over the long term. 20132014201520162017201820192020Est.Assets27,42327,15321,71723,04625,76426,46227,15527,084 Domestic deposits3632902802321841388959 Foreign deposits00000000 Oil reserves13,41011,8706,6746,5617,6427,7018,3708,282 Public capital stock13,64914,99314,76316,25317,93718,62318,69618,743Liabilities3,4694,6966,0227,1528,0899,0149,78510,571 Domestic debt1,0141,3751,8422,2302,4822,7623,0823,469 External debt1,7662,7743,6604,4295,1375,8066,2806,699 Arrears689547520494469446423402Net worth23,95422,45615,69415,89317,67517,44917,37016,514 Net worth excluding oil reserves10,54410,5879,0219,33210,0339,7488,9998,232Assets187.8174.0129.0127.7133.2127.3121.7113.1Liablities23.830.135.839.641.843.443.944.1Net Worth164.0143.993.388.191.484.077.869.0 Net worth excluding oil reserves72.267.853.651.751.946.940.334.4 Sources: Data provided by the Cameroonian authorities; and IMF staff calculations and projections. Cameroon: Government Balance Sheet 2013–20 Projections(CFAF billions)(Percent of GDP) Page 15 Figure 4. Selected Countries: Gross Government Debt, 2010–20 (Percent of GDP) Cameroon’s nominal and real effective exchange rates (REERs) appreciated between 2012 and 2014. This trend reversed the depreciation experienced in the wake of the global recession of 2008–09, but represents a continuation of the long-term appreciation witnessed since 1994 (Annex II). Nonetheless, model-based assessments find that the REER is not significantly misaligned with current account norms. These findings are consistent with the CEMAC regional consultation of mid-2015, which also concluded that there was no significant misalignment for the regional REER. Medium-term macroeconomic stability is threatened by growing risks (Annex III). Cameroon’s outlook is adversely affected by growing external risks: (i) a protracted global commodity price slump; and (ii) terrorist attacks in the extreme north increasing and overflowing into the rest of the country. Domestic risks include: (i) contingent liabilities arising from state-owned enterprises (SOEs; companion selected issues paper—SIP); (ii) a return of fuel subsidies under an unreformed fuel-subsidy scheme, should international oil prices rise (SIP); and (iii) excessive credit exposure of the national refinery (SONARA) jeopardizing the banking system and the real sector. The authorities have been actively seeking international financial and operational support to counter the security threats. Data provision to the IMF is broadly adequate for surveillance, but important gaps remain in fiscal and external sectors information. Government fiscal operations, on a commitment basis, are not available and the timeliness of debt figures should be improved. The quality and timeliness of balance of payments statistics have improved, but further work is needed to move toward the 6 Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
