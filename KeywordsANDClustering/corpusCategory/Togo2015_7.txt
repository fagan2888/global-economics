(in percent, end of period) Text Table 4. Togo: Financial Soundness Indicators, 2011â€“15 While the overall financial system is sound, the financial condition of some banks has weakened since 2013 . As a result, solvency indicators and asset quality have worsened, and profitability and liquidity have suffered (Text Table 4). The banking sector as a whole respects the minimum solvency ratio (8 percent) but 3 out of 13 banks were under-capitalized as of March 2015. At the same time, large exposures to single creditors continue to be a widespread problem in the system, with only 5 banks out of 13 respecting the prudential ratio, as of March 2015 (Text Figures 9 and 10). The deterioration in the average indicators hence seem to reflect the poor financial condition of some banks taking excessive risks in a sector that has become increasingly competitive with the continuous establishment of new market participants, as well as a deceleration of economic activity in the services sector in 2014.
