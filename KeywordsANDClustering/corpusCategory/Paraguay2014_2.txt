Growth is projected to remain near 4 percent in 2015, amid broadly balanced risks Weak trading partner growth and lower export prices cloud the outlook, and agricultural production is projected to rise only marginally above the high level of 2014. Meanwhile, positive impulses should come from the expected rebound in electricity generation, the lower oil price, and the launch of new infrastructure projects. Yet, uncertainty around the outlook is considerable (Risk Assessment Matrix), as worsening terms of trade could affect domestic spending more than anticipated, while Paraguay’s exchange rate regime was formally reclassified to floating in mid-2013. Under the previous classification (“other managed arrangement”), the current level of reserves was closely aligned with the relevant adequacy metric. Required FX reserves of banks accounted for one-sixth of the BCP’s total international reserves at end-2014.

Exposures to global financial volatility are limited by the lack of domestic capital markets, though shocks could conceivably be transmitted through foreign banks operating in Paraguay (Box 1). On the upside, a recent hydrocarbon discovery might foreshadow the beginning of oil production in Paraguay; and looser-than-expected fiscal policy could lift 2015 growth above staff’s projection of 4 percent. Inflation is expected to hover around the revised 4.5 percent target in 2015, as recent guaraní depreciation and a small positive output gap balance the impact of lower commodity prices. Looking further ahead, Paraguay’s growth prospects hinge on the successful implementation of ongoing reforms . Like all of South America, Paraguay is confronting the end of an extended period of extraordinarily benign external conditions. The more challenging external environment underscores the importance of strengthening the domestic underpinnings of growth, notably by addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the business environment to attract private investment. Under a scenario of measured, but steady implementation of the government’s reform agenda, medium-term growth around 4 percent is realistic. However, failure to achieve the sustained expansion of public and private investment projected by staff could reduce potential growth by a full percentage point. In 2013, total exports to Russia reached nearly US$950 million, the bulk of which accounted for by meat. Given large technical and commercial uncertainties surrounding the discovery, potential hydrocarbon production is not included in staff’s projections. The BCP announced in mid-December 2014 that it had lowered its midpoint target to 4.5 percent for 2015/16. This scenario would entail a gradual rise in public and private investment, though capacity constraints would impose delays relative to the authorities’ ambitious plans for infrastructure spending; and modest additional steps to improve the business environment.

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. 2/ Policy response recommended by staff. Fiscal response circumscribed by Paraguay’s Fiscal Responsibility Law. Page 10 Box 1. Global and Regional Spillovers to Paraguay Paraguay is exposed to external shocks, chiefly through trade channels Trade openness is among the highest in the region, with total registered exports and imports at 80 percent of GDP. Trade is also heavily concentrated, making Paraguay vulnerable to shocks from major trading partners and commodity markets. Meanwhile, portfolio inflows into local financial markets are negligible, reflecting the dearth of investable assets. However, foreign-owned banks (notably from Brazil and Spain) account for more than 40 percent of total bank loans and deposits, and there is some cross-border lending, mostly to local banks and companies. High levels of financial dollarization provide another potential channel for transmitting external shocks, though Paraguay’s financial system has sizeable buffers to cope with such shocks. Developments in Brazil are of particular importance As Paraguay’s largest trading partner, Brazil accounts for 30 percent of registered exports and the bulk of re-exports. Recently, Brazil’s weak growth and currency depreciation has dampened demand for re-exports, contributing to slower activity in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay’s main hub for cross-border trading. However, there have also been positive spillovers, notably through rising FDI inflows into Paraguay’s maquila industry, which attracts Brazilian companies with its relatively low cost base and favorable tax and regulatory regime. Overall, staff estimates suggest that a one percent decline in Brazilian output reduces Paraguay’s output by 0.5 percent; a 10 percent real depreciation of the bilateral exchange rate is estimated to have a similar effect. Recent spillovers from Argentina have mainly been transmitted through surging contraband imports . Argentina’s export taxes and FX market controls have created strong incentives for contraband trade. Since mid-2012, contraband exports to Paraguay appear to have proliferated, alongside the widening gap between the official and informal market exchange rates of the peso. For the most part, the contraband (especially foodstuffs and household goods) displaces legal imports, as domestic production in Paraguay is limited. However, businesses involved in the formal distribution and retail chain have been negatively affected, while consumers have benefited from lower prices. Separately, there is anecdotal evidence for Argentine capital flows into Paraguay’s property market. Changes in commodity prices have potentially large effects on Paraguay’s economy . The recent decline in the price of soybeans, Paraguay’s major export, is likely to reduce profits rather than production, given still-solid margins. However, sustained further price declines in agricultural commodity prices could hurt business confidence and restrain investment and output. The lower oil price, in contrast, conveys significant benefits, as Paraguay imports its entire fuel needs. These benefits are manifest in greater consumer purchasing power and reduced losses at Petropar, the state-owned fuel importer. Overall, a 10 percent drop in Paraguay’s net commodity price index is estimated to reduce GDP growth by 0.6 percent within one year. 1/ Prepared by Xin Xu.

Page 11 The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, but projected slightly faster growth . For both 2015 and the medium term, the authorities reaffirmed their previous projection of 4.5 percent growth. They emphasized that the industrialization of the agricultural sector is still in the early stages and holds significant potential for future expansion. Moreover, the build-out of public infrastructure would proceed at a somewhat faster pace than projected by staff, catalyzing fresh private investment and helping to keep growth close to the high rates observed over the past decade. Although the authorities recognized the challenging external environment as a risk, they argued that Paraguay was very well prepared to weather adverse external shocks, thanks to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and the resulting room for maneuver in policies.
