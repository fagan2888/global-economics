THE OIL PRICE SHOCK The principal theme of the 2015 Article IV consultations was the impact of lower oil prices on the economy, especially on the budget and the financial sector. Another key issue was how to reassess and reprioritize the PSGE so that it can be sustainably financed. Staff also assessed progress on other important issues and recommendations discussed during the 2014 Article IV consultations, including on the PSGE, structural reforms, and economic data shortcomings (see Annex II). As indicated in Annex II, there has been an improvement in the implementation of previous Article IV recommendations.
