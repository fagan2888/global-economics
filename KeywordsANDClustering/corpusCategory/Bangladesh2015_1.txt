The Bangladesh economy has undergone a major transformation in the past two decades (Figure 1). GDP growth has been strong and largely stable since the mid-1990s (average: 5.8 percent), allowing real per capita income to double over the period. The shares of manufacturing and services in GDP rose, spearheaded by the emergence of the garment industry. Poverty has declined steadily, while inequality has remained broadly stable. In addition, Bangladesh has made major strides on social indicators, and compares favorably to other low-income countries (Figure 2). In the two years since the last Article IV consultation, prudent policies have underpinned a generally strong macroeconomic performance (Figure 3), supported by the recently-completed Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with the IMF (Appendix I). Real GDP growth has been robust; headline inflation has eased; international reserves have risen further; and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has remained stable at a moderate level. However, tax revenues have underperformed, and economic activity has been tepid more recently. Political calm has returned, but tensions remain. Disputes between the main political parties, particularly over the legitimacy of the January 2014 general elections and the conviction of key opposition leaders by an ongoing war crimes tribunal, have led to episodes of violence over the past two years. Widespread violence has subsided since the elections, except for a brief resurgence in early 2015. However, underlying tensions remain, leading to lingering uncertainty.
