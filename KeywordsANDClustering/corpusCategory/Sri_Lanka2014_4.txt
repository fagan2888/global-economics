Sri Lanka’s public debt sustainability assessment indicates high risks but a sustainable debt trajectory (see DSA supplement). The debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP and gross financing need benchmark of 15 percent of GDP are exceeded in the baseline and in all shock scenarios. This contrasts with a benign market assessment (bond spreads are within the 200–600 point range of lower and upper risk benchmark). Positive market sentiment reflects: (i) sustained fiscal adjustment and falling debt ratio; (ii) favorable global environment (iii) credible commitment to further deficit and debt reduction in the future; (iv) lengthening of average debt maturity; and (v) limited nonresident holding of government debt in domestic currency which contributed to Sri Lanka’s resilience during market turbulence. The DSA also illustrates the critical contribution of growth to recent and projected declines in the debt ratio. Slower- than-projected growth (alone or combined with a higher primary deficit and higher borrowing costs) could stop or reverse the fall in the public debt ratio. The high share of foreign currency denominated debt also creates a vulnerability to currency depreciation.
