Aruba is recovering gradually from a severe double-dip recession . The economy suffered two major shocks over the past five years: the global financial crisis and closure of the Valero oil refinery in 2012 (Figure 2). After a strong recovery in 2013, with growth at 4¾ percent, the pace of activity moderated in 2014.

Growing Fiscal Imbalances Amid Lower Growth Page 6 broad-based contraction in domestic demand due to waning confidence, fiscal policy uncertainty, and investment delays. The unemployment rate is estimated to have remained broadly flat in 2014 at about 7½ percent. Recent data indicate positive but low headline inflation rates at around ½ percent, below the average of the last decade (2½ percent). While external imbalances remain elevated, they have improved recently. The current account (CA) deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 7½ percent of GDP in 2014 with the non-oil CA in surplus, largely reflecting developments in the tourism sector. Both the net international investment position (IIP) and external debt have improved in 2014, and roll- over risks are mitigated as 90 percent of the debt is long-term, half of which is owed to parent companies. Aruba’s gross international reserves cover around 3¾ months of imports and 35 percent of broad money.
