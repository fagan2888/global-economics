Discussions focused on the need to further reduce vulnerabilities and to transition to growth driven by a vibrant private sector. On the policy mix, staff advocated for a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to help build buffers and provide space for greater private-sector activity, and accommodative monetary policy to support growth and external adjustment. Staff called for structural policies to improve the investment climate, enhance competitiveness, and address weaknesses in the labor market. Such a policy mix would increase Hungaryâ€™s medium-term growth potential, as structural reforms advance and the budget quality improves. Increased market confidence and enhanced competitiveness would lift private investment, including from abroad. Labor market reforms would increase participation, particularly that of women and the low-skilled, also supporting higher growth. Under this strategy, growth could accelerate to more than 3 percent over the medium term, the investment ratio could reach pre-crisis levels, and the public debt ratio could fall gradually to around 60 percent.
