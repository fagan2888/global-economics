The upcoming budget is an opportunity to restore a downward trend in the public debt-to-GDP ratio . Under unchanged fiscal policies beyond 2015 and staff’s macroeconomic projections, the net debt ratio would creep upwards over the medium term, approaching less comfortable levels. Moreover, adverse shocks to growth, interest rates, and the exchange rate could worsen the debt dynamics (Annex III). Staff welcomed the planned fiscal withdrawal for 2015, and recommended increasing the structural fiscal balance by an additional 2 percentage points of GDP in the following four years, which would help keep net public debt close to current levels in 2019 and on a firm downward trend in the medium run. The improvement in the primary fiscal balance could come from a mix of expenditure and revenue measures . The relatively high share of rigid spending (pensions, social assistance and wages) poses a challenge to improving the primary balance through expenditure restraint alone. Therefore, revenue-enhancing measures would also be needed. While sustained expenditure restraint could gradually deliver part of the targeted improvement in the primary balance, revenue measures could be adopted upfront, in 2016, to reduce the eventual adjustment need and achieve a visible change in the direction of debt right away. Table 2 presents an adjustment path along these lines. On the expenditure side , real spending growth could be kept below real GDP growth. For instance, capping the growth of real primary expenditures at 2 percent from 2016 onwards would contribute two-thirds of the recommended adjustment over four years. To help ensure compliance with expenditure targets, there would be merit in incorporating a numerical expenditure rule in the next five-year budget. The real expenditure growth targets could be converted into a nominal expenditure ceiling for each individual year of the five-year budget period and be reduced over time if disinflation proceeds faster than expected. Also, targeting higher spending efficiency would help accommodate any new spending priorities without stretching the expenditure envelope.

Page 19 On the revenue side , a mix of measures could be considered. In particular, lowering the minimum income threshold for the PIT (currently, only about 35 percent of employees are estimated to contribute to the PIT), limiting VAT exemptions (estimated at 3 percent of GDP), and reviewing the business tax exemptions (about 2 percent of GDP) and eliminating those that are not clearly conducive to long-term growth could deliver the remaining adjustment. Authorities’ views on fiscal policy Objectives and composition . The authorities agreed that keeping the net debt to GDP ratio stable over the next five-year budget period would be desirable. They noted that a precise policy strategy would be outlined in the next five-year budget to be submitted to Parliament by June 2015. They stressed that a number of investment projects implemented by the state-owned 2013201420152016201720182019Real GDP growth (percent)4.43.32.82.93.03.33.3CPI inflation (percent, eop)8.58.37.47.37.06.76.4Overall balance of the public sector-2.4-3.3-2.8-2.8-2.9-2.9-2.8Primary balance of the Central government, BPS and NFPEs0.4-0.40.30.1-0.2-0.3-0.3Primary revenues30.430.330.230.129.929.729.7 Primary expenditure30.130.729.930.030.030.030.0 Real growth of primary expenditure (percent)8.65.30.03.23.03.23.1Real growth of primary non-pension expenditure (percent)10.55.5-1.73.32.83.23.1 Structural primary balance of the public sector-0.9-1.1-0.2-0.2-0.3-0.3-0.3Gross public sector debt62.163.664.365.165.566.266.9Net public sector debt (Gross debt minus liquid financial assets)36.537.638.739.840.942.043.0Real GDP growth (percent)4.43.32.82.72.93.23.3CPI inflation (percent, eop)8.58.37.47.16.96.66.3Overall balance of the public sector-2.4-3.3-2.8-1.9-1.5-0.9-0.4Primary balance of the Central government, BPS and NFPEs0.4-0.40.31.11.11.41.8Primary revenues30.430.330.230.730.530.430.4Primary expenditure30.130.729.929.629.329.028.6 Real growth of primary expenditure (percent)8.65.30.02.02.02.02.0Real growth of primary non-pension expenditure (percent)10.55.5-1.71.21.21.41.2 Structural primary balance of the public sector-0.9-1.1-0.20.81.01.41.8Gross public sector debt62.163.664.364.363.462.561.1Net public sector debt (Gross debt minus liquid financial assets)36.537.638.738.938.838.137.13/ The assumed GDP multipliers are 0.3 for expenditures and 0.2 for revenues, consistent with empirical research for emerging markets. See, for example, N. Batini, L. Eyraud, and A. Weber, 2014, “A Simple Method to Compute Fiscal Multipliers,” IMF Working Paper 14/93 (Washington: International Monetary Fund); and E. Ilzetzki, 2011, “Fiscal Policy and Debt Dynamics in Developing Countries,” Policy Research Working Paper 5666 (Washington: The World Bank), which show that in emerging markets spending multipliers generally range from 0.1 to 0.3, while revenue multipliers lie between 0.2 and 0.4. 2/ The fiscal consolidation scenario assumes a 2.0 percent cap on the growth rate of real primary expenditures and a persistent increase in revenues of about ½ percentage point of GDP from 2016 onwards.

Uruguay: Baseline and Fiscal Adjustment Scenarios 1/ Sources: Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas, Banco Central del Uruguay, and Fund staff calculations.1/ Both the baseline and the fiscal adjustment scenarios assume that the ratio of primary expenditures to GDP declines by 0.8 percentage points in 2015, as the discretionary expenditures of the central government are kept constant in nominal terms and spending by nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPE) slows down.

The authorities saw limited scope for reducing tax exemptions, which they consider to be well targeted. They underscored the success of investment incentives in attracting FDI and noted that revising the business tax exemptions would create uncertainty and potentially undermine investment prospects. Framework . The authorities stressed that their fiscal policy framework already incorporates a net debt rule imposing a limit on the annual increase in the net liabilities of the consolidated public sector. They took note of staff’s argument that an expenditure rule would entail less procyclicality than a net debt rule.
