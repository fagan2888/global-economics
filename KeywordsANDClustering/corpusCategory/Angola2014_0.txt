Angola was hard hit by the global crisis, but restored macroeconomic stability under the Stand-By Arrangement (2009-12) and Post-Program Monitoring (2012-14) . Economic growth, particularly of the nonoil sector, has been solid, inflation has been brought to (historically low) single digits, and external and fiscal buffers have been restored. Despite Angola’s significant oil wealth, income inequality remains high and poverty has declined only slowly . The 2008-09 household survey, released in 2011, shows that Angola’s income distribution is amongst the most unequal in sub-Saharan Africa, with the top 10 percent of income earners concentrating one-third of total income, and a poverty headcount ratio of 37 percent, and 58 percent in rural areas. The last general elections in 2012 were comfortably won by the ruling MPLA party Since the elections, the authorities have sought to address persistent poverty, by targeting improved basic services, especially water and electricity, diversify the economy, and make growth more inclusive, through the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) covering 2013-17. The NDP prioritizes a significant expansion of capital spending to address the country’s large infrastructure deficit and improve economic diversification and competitiveness in the nonoil sector.
