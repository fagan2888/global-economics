Economic policies should support a rise in inflation and limit the upside risks to unemployment while protecting macrofinancial stability over the medium term. A firmly stimulatory monetary stance is appropriate to avoid prolonged low inflation that would prevent monetary policy from regaining space to cushion shocks. Addressing house price and household debt vulnerabilities in a durable manner requires structural reforms and fiscal measures to rebalance housing supply and demand. Yet the benefits of such reforms would come over time. Hence, well targeted prudential measures are also needed, calibrated to protect household financial resilience while avoiding significant drag on domestic demand that would counteract monetary stimulus. Swedenâ€™s fiscal position provides room for a broadly neutral stance in the near term and allows potential migration costs to be met over the medium term, while undertaking reforms to help address the housing and unemployment challenges.
