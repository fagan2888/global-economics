Solid growth over the past decade, supported by rising oil prices and output, helped Kazakhstan achieve a middle-income country status, but vulnerabilities remain. High oil prices helped the economy recover rapidly from the 2008–09 crisis. Output growth has been somewhat lower in the past three years than the pre-crisis levels but remains strong, while inflation and employment growth have been relatively stable (Figure 1). At the same time, the banking sector has been burdened by a legacy of high NPLs from the crisis. While government debt is low and fiscal buffers are high, state-owned enterprises’ debt, given the large size of their activities, poses contingent liability risks for the state. Downside domestic and external demand risks weigh on the outlook for growth. In the face of slowing economic growth and concerns about external competitiveness, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) devalued the local currency by 18 percent in February. The authorities justified the devaluation by the deterioration in the current account balance, concern about competitiveness due to depreciation in the Russian ruble, and a fall in central bank international reserves. The devaluation was accompanied by the introduction of a narrow exchange rate band. In staff’s assessment, based on CGER-type methodology, the tenge was only moderately overvalued at end-2013 (Box 1). Amid uncertain external environment, the reappointment of Prime Minister Massimov in April was aimed at bolstering confidence and reforms. The direction of macroeconomic policy is unlikely to be altered significantly, but some new spending plans have been introduced, and Mr. Massimov, who previously held the Prime Minister position during 2007–12, has signaled his intention to speed up structural reforms, with the help of the MDBs.
