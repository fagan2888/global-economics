The Czech economy is growing at a strong pace but challenges remain. With the support of accommodative macroeconomic policies, output growth rebounded in 2014. A further acceleration is in train, with both exports and domestic demand performing well. The central bank’s use of an exchange rate floor as an additional instrument to achieve its inflation objective has helped stem deflationary pressures, but inflation remains well below target. At the same time, fiscal framework legislation that would anchor policy is yet to be approved. The challenge for the authorities is to create conditions for sustainable growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The strong growth performance has helped keep the coalition stable. The government—a coalition of the Social Democrats, a new center right party (ANO), and the Christian Democrats—took office in January 2014, roughly simultaneous with the upturn in the business cycle, following the previous fiscally-conservative and euro-skeptic coalition. Although the new government is friendlier to the EU policy agenda, it is ideologically diverse. On one hand, its overall orientation is toward more activist social welfare-enhancing policies, while on the other hand, ANO has pledged not to increase taxes and to put strong emphasis on improving tax administration.
