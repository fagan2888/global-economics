Staff argued in favor of a macroeconomic policy mix that combines tighter fiscal policy with continued monetary policy accommodation. Fiscal policy: The strong fiscal impulse in 2015 was appropriate, given the severity of the slowdown, the need to cushion the temporary effects of structural reforms, the low level of debt, and the emphasis on infrastructure and education spending (which account for about half of the 9 percent projected increase in public expenditure this year). However, a steady process of fiscal consolidation is warranted beginning from 2016, given that the economy is expected to recover gradually. Reaffirming the commitment to a structural balanced budget position in the medium term would also help anchor expectations and boost private sector confidence. Based on staff’s assumptions about long-term GDP growth and copper prices, the structural deficit in 2015 is about 2¾ percent of GDP (against 1.1 percent in the last Budget). Moreover, achieving the target of a balanced structural fiscal position in 2018 would require an average growth of public spending of just below 3 percent in real terms over 2016–2018. Given the strong credibility of Chile’s fiscal framework and lack of debt sustainability issues (Table A.2), staff noted that the authorities have room to proceed with a slower pace of fiscal consolidation if the fiscal tightening were to weigh excessively on pro-growth expenditures (such as infrastructure and education). At the same time, if the return of business confidence were to be slower than expected, the fiscal policy stance should not be relaxed, as sticking to the commitment to eliminate the structural fiscal deficit over time would likely contribute more to supporting private sector demand than fine- tuning public spending. Monetary policy has room to remain accommodative until there are strong signs that the economic recovery consolidates. The central bank’s baseline scenario (as presented in the June Monetary Policy Report ) projects no interest rate increase until early 2016. Staff sees this stance as appropriate, and noted that there is room to adopt a wait-and-see attitude until the risks surrounding the economic recovery dissipate, given the well-anchored inflation expectations, the projected decline in headline inflation, and the downside risks to growth.

The authorities broadly concurred with staff . They agreed that the beginning and pace of normalization of interest rates should remain conditional on the strength of the economic recovery, and noted that the large fiscal impulse in 2015 is not sustainable and needs to be followed by a process of fiscal consolidation, safeguarding the credibility of the fiscal framework. They also agreed that restating the commitment to a structural budget over the medium run would support confidence and reduce uncertainty, although the pace of consolidation would depend on the new assumptions on long-term growth and copper prices, which will be made public at the time of the Budget in the fall of 2015. However, they noted that staff’s assumptions on long-term GDP growth and copper prices appear relatively pessimistic. Hence, the reduction in real public expenditure growth required to reach a balanced budget in 2018 may not be as pronounced as envisaged by staff. They also highlighted their intention to simplify the implementation of the tax reform by providing more guidance to firms, and are preparing a new fiscal responsibility law that would strengthen the role and governance of the Fiscal Council.
