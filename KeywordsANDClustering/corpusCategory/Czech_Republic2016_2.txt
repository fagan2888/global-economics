Economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2016. Private consumption will remain robust on the heels of higher disposable income and employment, but the projected slowdown in EU-fund absorption will weigh on growth. Over the medium-term, output growth is set to stabilize at slightly above 2 percent in line with the economy’s potential (Box 2). Inflation is expected to reach the 2 percent target in 2017, as base effects from the oil price shock fade and domestic demand pressures pull inflation up. The current account is projected to remain in a small but declining surplus, before moving toward a deficit on account of improving investment and in line with fundamentals. Czech Republic: Key Macroeconomic Indicators, 2013–21 (In percent of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) The balance of risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix— appears to be tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-projected external demand, notably from the euro area but also indirectly from China and other emerging markets would weigh on exports, especially given the role of the Czech industry in the Germany-Central European supply chain. An escalation of the refugee crisis in Europe or a decision by UK voters to leave the EU could increase market uncertainty, and affect trade and economic activity. Moreover, global financial market turbulence could generate safe-haven capital inflows that would contribute to appreciation pressures, while a prolonged period of low interest rates could—absent effective macro prudential measures—lead to overvaluation of real estate and other asset prices that could threaten financial stability. On the upside, the positive effects from supportive macroeconomic policies, lower oil prices, improved economic sentiment, and the ECB’s quantitative easing could be larger than currently forecast.

Page 13 public investment, and they broadly agreed on the medium-term prospects. They saw mostly externally-driven risks as tilted primarily to the downside, notably the possible slowdown in the euro area and emerging markets, and intensification of geopolitical tensions which could have a negative impact on market sentiment in the region. All in all, the authorities saw these risks as a reason to sustain or even strengthen policies supportive of domestic demand. Finally, they agreed on the need to boost potential growth as a key element for the convergence process.
