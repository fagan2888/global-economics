SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Further monetary easing via purchases of (mainly foreign) assets and strong communication of the SNB’s objective to boost inflation over the medium term could help lessen the near-term growth slowdown, reduce risks of entrenching low inflation, and limit franc overvaluation. Scope for fiscal policy to support aggregate demand is limited by Switzerland’s fiscal rule and the small, open nature of its economy. That said, fiscal automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely, as allowed under the rule, and the rule’s escape clause should be triggered in the event of a severe downturn to allow discretionary fiscal stimulus. Pension and corporate tax reforms are key priorities for fiscal structural reforms. Page 18
