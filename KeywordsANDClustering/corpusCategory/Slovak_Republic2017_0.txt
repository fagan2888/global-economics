The Slovak economy has seen strong and sustained convergence. Real GDP per capita increased from around 45 percent of the European Union (EU) average in 1997 to over 70 percent in 2015. Productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, which has strong links to global supply chains, has been a key driver of this convergence. Although growth has eased in the post-crisis years, Slovakia’s recovery has been among the strongest in the Euro area (EA) with real GDP and its components now above their pre-crisis levels. However, economic prosperity has not been evenly shared across regions. In fact, as measured by the Gini coefficients, Slovakia shows the highest regional disparities among EU countries. Although all regions have seen declining unemployment and some increase in per capita income over the last decade, gains have been heavily concentrated in the Bratislava region (Box 1). Unemployment rates in Eastern and Central Slovakia are about three times as high as in the Bratislava region, which also enjoys a much higher per capita income. Lower educational attainment and underdeveloped infrastructure explain much of these disparities. An estimated 1.1 million people, roughly a fifth of the population and mostly concentrated in lagging regions, are considered at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Meanwhile, productivity growth has slowed. While this is to some extent a global phenomenon, concerns in Slovakia are particularly acute as the economy faces significant further headwinds from aging of both the population and the workforce. Labor productivity growth, which was the engine of pre-crisis output growth, is estimated to have nearly halved during 2009–2015 due to lower total factor productivity (TFP) growth and capital deepening (Annex I). With the increase in Slovakia’s old age dependency ratio projected to be the largest in the EU, a further slowdown in productivity growth is likely. Sustaining convergence at its current pace may therefore prove challenging in the long run.
