Growth. The economy is stagnating. While delays in the compilation of economic data have hampered the assessment of the economy, staff estimates real GDP growth to be around 0.1 percent for FY2014. Externally-funded infrastructure projects are moving slowly: land tenure issues continue to hold back the implementation of some projects while delays in updating the infrastructure development plan of 2004 have resulted in the temporary suspension of Compact infrastructure grants for new projects. Falling oil prices resulted in the decline of CPI from 2.1 percent in FY2013 to 0.7 percent in FY2014. External balance. The current account improved from a deficit of -10 percent of GDP in FY2013 to 2½ percent of GDP in FY2014. The main driving force behind this was a tax windfall from a company’s sale of shares launched on a foreign stock exchange and an increase in fishing license fees. Staff projects that the fishing license fee will stay at the same level in the medium term. Export of goods, at around 15–16 percent of GDP, continues to be concentrated in exports of tuna to Thailand and other East Asian countries. Outlook. The economy is expected to be sluggish in FY2015, as the difficult business climate will continue to hamper private sector growth while the implementation of externally-financed infrastructure projects is likely to experience further delays.

The continued pass through of low oil prices will result in further decline in consumer prices. In this context, staff projects growth at 0.3 percent for FY2015. Risks to the outlook. Overall, risks are tilted to the downside (Appendix 2). The loosely federated structure of the country could result in further delays of the much-awaited reform agenda. While the “2023 Action Plan” shows a number of essential reforms for the future of the FSM, it remains a plan that needs to be underpinned by a multitude of legislative measures. Natural disasters such as tropical cyclones could cause damages that are significant compared to the small size of the economy. On the upside, further decline in oil prices and faster-than-expected implementation of structural reforms could boost the economy. As the Micronesian economy is heavily dependent on the public sector and foreign grant assistance, changes in the global economy would not have much impact. However, it may affect the tourism industry that the authorities are promoting. Authorities’ view. The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook. They shared the view that achieving national consensus to implement the policy actions included in the “2023 Action Plan” will be the key to boost the economy and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability beyond the expiration of Compact grants in 2023. In this regard, the authorities noted that an extensive public awareness campaign has been put in place to gain a nationwide support, including in places outside of the country (e.g., Guam and Hawaii) where there is a large Micronesian community.
