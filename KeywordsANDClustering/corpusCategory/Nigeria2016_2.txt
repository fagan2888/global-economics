Macroeconomic outcomes deteriorated sharply in 2015. The collapse in oil prices has decimated government revenues, which fell to just 7.8 percent of GDP and doubled the general government deficit to about 3.7 percent of GDP in 2015. Exports dropped about 40 percent in 2015, pushing the current account from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP to a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP and, with uncertainty about policy direction, foreign portfolio inflows slowed significantly. Foreign exchange shortages, fuel stoppages, and continued security challenges significantly impacted private sector activity and growth slowed sharply to 2.7 percent in 2015 (from 6.3 percent in 2014), likely reversing progress in reducing unemployment (9.9 percent) and poverty (above 50 percent in the northern states) (Figure 2). The slowdown in the economy weakened corporate balance sheets and lowered assets quality of the banking system . As opposed to the 2008-09 global crisis, the non-oil corporate sector entered the 2014-15 crisis with weaker performance and more leveraged balance sheets. The interest cover ratio of the corporate sector declined from 4 in 2008 to 2 by end-2014. With the corporate sector accounting for 80 percent of bank loans, further financial deterioration of the corporate sector could impair bank resilience and provision of credit to the economy. The CBN adjusted various instruments in an attempt to meet multiple objectives. In response to pressures in the Foreign Exchange (FX) market, the CBN imposed restrictions on commercial banks’ FX trading, closed the official FX auction window, and channeled those transactions to the interbank market, effectively devaluing the official rate to the interbank rate by about 18 percent (February 2015). Since then, it has tightly managed the interbank exchange rate and introduced restrictions on access to FX, which has resulted in a wide spread between the rates on the interbank and Bureau de Change (BDC) markets (Figure 2). The drop in FX market liquidity resulting from these measures led J.P. Morgan to exclude Nigerian domestic bonds from its local currency government bond indexes. At the same time, to stimulate the slowing economy, the CBN expanded special intervention schemes and since September 2015 eased the monetary policy rate and reversed the increases in the reserve requirements implemented in November 2014 and May 2015, notwithstanding inflation rising above the medium-term target range. The resultant increase in liquidity has pushed short-term interest rates to near zero. Page 11 Figure 2.

Gross international reserves (GIR) have continued to fall (to $28.3 billion at end-2015), despite the introduction of foreign exchange restrictions, reducing reserve coverage to 100 percent of the standard IMF reserve adequacy metric and increasing the ratio of the sum of short-term external debt liabilities and the current account deficit to reserves from about 50 percent to 100 percent. The Excess Crude Account is at a low $2.3 billion (from $11 billion in 2012) and FGN interest payments-to-revenue ratio is estimated (in 2015) to have increased to 32 percent (from 27 percent in 2014). The unemployment rate has increased from 6.4 percent in 2014Q4 to 9.9 percent in 2015Q3, with the youth unemployment (below age 24) now at 18 percent.
