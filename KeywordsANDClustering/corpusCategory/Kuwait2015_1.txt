The Economy continued to grow in 2014, albeit at a lower rate, reflecting some slowdown in investment activity. The estimated slowdown in non-oil growth to 3.2 percent in 2014 and 3 percent in 2015 (4.2 percent in 2013), has been driven by moderating activity across sectors. Oil production declined by 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively in 2014 and 2015, due partly to the closure of a neutral zone oilfield in the latter half of 2014 and a temporary suspension of operations in a few fields for technical reasons in May this year. This has reduced overall real GDP growth to around zero in 2014–15. Average inflation increased slightly to 3 percent in 2014, and edged up to 3.8 percent in August 2015, driven mainly by housing rents (Figure 1). Financial market conditions are subdued. Stock prices declined by about 24 percent y-o-y at end-September 2015, reflecting global financial market volatility, and regional geopolitical and domestic economic uncertainties. Corporate sector profitability remained stable in the first half of 2015. The CBK kept its discount rate, the key benchmark rate for lending, unchanged at 2.0 percent. Growth in banks’ deposits and credit to the private sector edged down to 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, in July 2015 (y-o- y) (Figure 2). One half of banks’ local credit is to real estate, including installment loans which grew at 15 percent y-o-y in July 2015. The average value of real estate appears to be softening, but there are no signs yet of a correction trend. As of July 2015, prices across the residential and investment property segments have seen average prices fall in year-on-year terms by 6 and 7 percent, respectively, while prices in the commercial segment have increased by 5 percent. The banking sector is well regulated and has shown resilience to the oil price shock. The sector had a capital adequacy ratio of 16.9 percent (Basel III definition), nonperforming loans ratio of 2.8 percent, and provisioning ratio of 172 percent on a consolidated basis at end-June 2015. Banks’ return on assets and equity increased, respectively, to 1.1 percent and 8.9 percent at end- March 2015 (1.0 percent and 7.4 percent in 2013), reflecting lower provision expenses, and profit growth of subsidiaries and branches abroad (Figure 3).

Page 11 investment companies (ICs) diminished to 2.8 percent of banks’ total lending, amid ICs ongoing downsizing of balance sheets (Figure 4). Lower oil revenue caused the fiscal and external positions to deteriorate sharply in In the government’s presentation, after mandatory transfers to the Future Generations Fund (FGF) of 25 percent of total revenues, and excluding investment income, the fiscal balance declined to a deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014/15 from a surplus of 11.7 percent in 2013/14. Under the IMF presentation, which does not take into account transfers to the FGF and includes staff’s estimate of investment income, the overall fiscal balance also narrowed sharply to a surplus of 17.4 percent, compared to a surplus of 34.8 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 5). The government increased diesel and kerosene prices and reduced subsidies on aviation fuel effective January 2015, with estimated savings of 0.3 percent of GDP annually. The current account surplus fell to 31.2 percent of GDP in 2014 from 39.5 percent in 2013. Kuwait: Oil Dependence and Budget Structure By law, a minimum of 10 percent of total revenue is transferred to the FGF. In each of the years during 2012–14 the government decided to transfer 25 percent. Fiscal data are based on fiscal year cycle which starts on April 1.
