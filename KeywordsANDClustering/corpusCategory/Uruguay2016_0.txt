Uruguay is demonstrating resilience in the face of sharp recessions in its large neighbors . With both Argentina and Brazil in deep recession in 2016, Uruguay’s projected growth of 1.2 percent is a marked departure from yesteryears when growth remained close to the average of its two neighbors. Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, and a commitment to diversify its markets and products within the dominant agriculture and forestry sectors have increased Uruguay’s ability to withstand regional shocks. Going forward, in order to safeguard and advance the socioeconomic gains of the past decade, including reduced poverty and inequality, it will be critical for Uruguay to invest in structural reforms that enhance its growth potential and to reinforce its record of macroeconomic stability, creating space for countercyclical policies over the medium term.
