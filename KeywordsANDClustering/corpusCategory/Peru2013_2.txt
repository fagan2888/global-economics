With economic growth decelerating on the back of uncertain external conditions, the discussions focused on: (i) near-term risk assessment and the appropriate policy mix, (ii) triggers for implementing countercyclical policies and the use of buffers, and (iii) addressing challenges in the structural area to preserve a strong growth momentum over the medium term. It was agreed that the current policy mix was broadly appropriate and that policy buffers could be used in a measured manner if additional turbulence in markets emerges. Going forward, policies should be geared towards accommodating a possible reduction of potential growth.
