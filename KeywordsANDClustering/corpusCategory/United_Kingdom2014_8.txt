To continue growing at historical trends the UK economy needs to address structural impediments in the economy. Although cyclical factors could partially account for the weakness in productivity growth, several structural factors in the UK economy are dampening long-run potential growth: Page 22 Infrastructure: Reducing bottlenecks in infrastructure, notably in transportation and energy, is a prerequisite to sustaining higher productivity gains. Currently, road congestion in the UK remains among the highest in the EU, and 20 percent of electricity generating capacity is expected to close within the next decade. A further expansion in public investment in infrastructure projects, within the medium-term fiscal framework, along with the implementation of well-designed guarantee schemes, could provide the necessary infrastructure to address capacity constraints. Education: Improving the economy’s skill base by investing in human capital not only can enhance the potential growth of the economy, but can also foster more inclusive growth. While the UK leads OECD countries in terms of educational attainment in tertiary education, it lags in the educational attainment of the population aged 15–19 years old. Only 78 percent of this population segment is enrolled in education, below the OECD average. A further expansion in vocational training and apprenticeship programs could provide the needed skills for the young and reduce the double-digit youth unemployment rate. Immigration: Restrictive immigration policies could have a negative impact on productivity growth. Relaxing immigration requirement in areas with labor shortages, such as manufacturing, could provide a boost to productivity and facilitate the rebalancing of the UK economy. In addition, loosening the visa regime for foreign students could contribute to expanding the skilled labor force and to improving the prospects of higher education exports.
