Economic activity is expected to strengthen further. The projected euro area recovery, supportive fiscal and monetary policies, and substantial slack in the economy will underpin growth performance over 2014–15. Staff projects growth at 2.5 percent this year, with one third and two thirds contributions from foreign and domestic demand, respectively—the latter is expected to turn positive for the first time since 2010. Investment will be supported by higher capacity utilization, greater clarity about the economic environment, foreign direct investment inflows, and greater take- up of European Union funds, whereas consumers will benefit from gains in labor income as well as improving confidence. At the same time, strong export performance (exports are projected to grow 7 percent in real terms this year) will be underpinned by positive trends in traditional markets (mainly the euro area) and products (mainly automotive and machinery). The effects of the depreciated exchange rate and recovering demand conditions are expected to push inflation gradually toward the 2 percent target. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around 2 percent driven by domestic demand, as the current account stabilizes around a small deficit of ½ percent of GDP. 20122013201420152016201720182019Real GDP growth (percent)-1.0-0.92.52.52.42.32.12.1Inflation (period average, percent)3.31.40.61.92.02.02.02.0General government overall balance-4.2-1.5-1.2-1.4-1.2-1.1-1.1-1.0General government gross debt46.246.044.344.344.143.542.942.3 Current account-1.3-1.4-0.2-0.3-0.4-0.4-0.4-0.4Reserves (in billions of dollars)4556586163667073Gross external debt52.256.154.452.049.848.146.946.1Sources: Czech authorities, and IMF staff projections Projections Czech Republic: Key macroeconomic indicators, 2012-19 (in percent of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) Page 9 Risks to the outlook are balanced. The ongoing recovery in Czech Republic’s trade partners, domestic slack, supportive macroeconomic policies, and the improving automotive cycle point to upside risks to growth. On the downside, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region could affect exports and also create uncertainty regarding energy security (Box 3). Moreover, if the euro area recovery falters, the Czech economy will be negatively affected mainly through the trade channel. The impact would be larger if low growth turns self-reinforcing through low investment in physical and human capital (see Risk Assessment Matrix). The authorities broadly agreed with the near-term outlook, medium-term prospects, and the balance of risks. Against a relatively upbeat baseline, they saw mostly externally-driven downside risks. They were somewhat concerned about re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area, possibly related to the outcomes from the Asset Quality Review and stress tests, as well as risks from potential geopolitical tensions in the region. On the whole, the authorities saw these risks as a reason to sustain or even strengthen policies that are supportive of domestic demand. Finally, they saw the need to boost potential growth as a key element for future prosperity and the convergence process.
