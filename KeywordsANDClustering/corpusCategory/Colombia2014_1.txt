Real GDP growth rebounded strongly in the second half of 2013. After slowing down to 2.9 percent y/y in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013, growth accelerated to 5.2 percent y/y in the second half of 2013, driven by higher public investment and a solid expansion in private consumption. On the supply side, output growth was broad-based, with strong gains in Page 6 construction and agriculture, with the only exception of manufacturing production, which fell by 1.2 percent. Overall, real GDP growth in 2013 as a whole averaged 4.3 percent, up from 4 percent in 2012. In turn, employment rose strongly, particularly in the formal sector of the economy, and unemployment declined to 9.7 percent in 2013, the lowest mark in the last decade. Inflation was subdued. Headline inflation fell to 1.9 percent y/y at end-2013, slightly below the 2‒4 percent target range, down from 2.4 percent at end-2012. Core inflation was also subdued at 2.4 percent y/y. A high supply of perishable foods (thanks to favorable weather conditions), stable fuel prices, and one-off price reductions arising from the implementation of the tax reform contributed to the benign inflation behavior of last year. As of March 2014, headline inflation rose to 2.5 percent y/y, and core inflation increased to 2.6 percent. Twelve-month inflation expectations stood at 3 percent, close to the mid-point of the target range. The current account deficit remained broadly stable. The current account deficit amounted to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013, up from 3.2 percent in 2012. The trade surplus narrowed as a result of lower exports, but was almost fully offset by a smaller deficit in the income account. The current account deficit continued to be financed by sizable surplus in the financial account (5 percent of GDP), largely driven by inward foreign direct investment (4.4 percent of GDP). Portfolio inflows by nonresidents remained firm. Colombia maintained fluid access to the international capital markets, with Ecopetrol and the government issuing long-term bonds in the last quarter of 2013 and early 2014, respectively. The central bank took advantage of the continued surplus in the capital account to strengthen its international reserves, which rose to US$43.2 billion. The net international investment position (NIIP) was broadly unchanged at 27 percent of GDP, with a high share of foreign direct investment (FDI) in total liabilities. The total external debt remained broadly stable at 24 percent of GDP. Both NIIP and external debt are relatively low compared to peer countries and have remained so for several years. The exchange rate depreciated and government bond prices fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering talk began in May 2013. The exchange rate depreciated by about 7 percent from May 22, 2013 to April 4, 2014, and foreign exchange market volatility increased (Box 1). Yields on 10-year domestic government debt initially rose by over 200 basis points (one of the largest increases among emerging markets), but later recovered some of the losses as markets began to differentiate between countries with strong economies such as Colombia. As of April 4, 2014, yields on 10-year domestic government debt had fallen to 130 basis points over the pre-May 22 level. Spreads on external government debt also increased. Fiscal performance was in line with the fiscal rule. Staff estimates that the central government’s fiscal deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP in 2013, in line with the fiscal rule. The combined public sector balance is estimated to have slipped into a deficit of 1 percent of GDP, from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2012, mainly due to deferred spending by local governments stemming For detailed analysis of past developments on NIIP and external debt, see IMF (2012), “Colombia 2012 Article IV Consultation.” Page 7 from a lag in transfers of oil revenues. The public sector debt is estimated at 35.2 percent of GDP at end-2013. The banking system remained stable. Financial soundness indicators remained strong, with low and well-provisioned non-performing loans, strong profitability, and adequate liquidity. New capital requirements became effective in August 2013, significantly enhancing the quality of banks’ capital. Growth in credit to private sector slowed to 12 percent y/y at end-2013, from 16 percent at end-2012, and was financed largely through an expansion in domestic deposits.
