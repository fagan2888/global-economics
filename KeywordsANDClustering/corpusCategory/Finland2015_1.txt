Real GDP Developments (Index: 2007Q4=100) Finland has suffered three years of recession. Though Finland initially bounced back from the global financial crisis in 2010–11, GDP declined by a cumulative 3 percent in 2012–14 (Table 1). Both domestic and external demand have been weak in the wake of the crisis (Figure 1). Rising unemployment, which increased to 8.7 percent in 2014, modest wage increases, and already indebted households contributed to a slowdown in private consumption in 2013–14. Weak growth, both at home and in key trade partners (euro area, Russia), has dampened firms’ ”animal spirits”, causing private sector investment to decline from 20 percent of GDP in 2007 to 16 percent in 2014. Inflation has slowed, as in the rest of the euro area, from 2.2 percent on average in 2013 to 1.2 percent in 2014, with end-of- period inflation at 0.6 percent. The decline is due largely to falling oil and food prices. The same factors are expected to lower average headline inflation further to 0.0 percent in 2015, while average core inflation is forecast at around 0.6 percent.

The most important shock has been the sharp decline in the ICT sector since 2007, due largely to the abrupt decline of Nokia’s handset business, which it sold to Microsoft in 2013 (Figure 2). The steep drop in demand during the crisis also accelerated the secular decline in the paper industry. The shrinkage of these high productivity industries explains a substantial fraction of the decline in aggregate productivity growth since 2007. Longer-term structural factors also contribute to Finland’s growth challenges, especially the rapidly aging workforce and slow labor supply growth.

Page 10 The current account has shifted to persistent deficits since the crisis. With the export- oriented electronics and wood and paper industries declining, nominal exports have fallen more than 10 percent from their peak in 2008. With imports only falling 1 percent over the same period, the trade balance has deteriorated (Figure 3). A wage agreement in 2007 that generated rapid wage increases in 2008–10 also contributed to a loss of competitiveness just as the crisis struck. As a result of the wage increases and falling productivity, unit labor costs (ULCs) have risen 25 percent since 2007. Pre-crisis current account surpluses have given way to persistent deficits, causing the net international investment position to deteriorate (Tables 2 and 3). However, the real effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).

Fiscal Balances The fiscal position has also slipped from surpluses to deficits and the constraints of the SGP have begun to bind. Despite slowing public consumption and investment growth, the general government deficit widened to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 4, Tables 4 and 5). This breach of the Stability and Growth Pact’s (SGP) 3 percent of GDP deficit threshold was primarily due to the weak economy and higher than expected unemployment. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio was just short of the SGP’s 60 percent threshold, but is forecast by staff to breach it in 2015. Despite the breach of the SGP limits, the European Commission decided not to recommend that Finland enter the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) in June based on the consolidation plans announced by the new government. Overall balance Structural balance SGP 3% deficit criterion Sources: IMF World Economic Outlook, and Fund staff The new government recognizes the challenges facing Finland and is planning action. The coalition government, which took office in May, has announced a broad structural reform Page 11 program, including labor market and benefits reforms to reduce unit labor costs and improve competitiveness. The medium-term fiscal plan envisages a consolidation worth around 2 percent of GDP over 2016–19. It aims to bring the deficit back in line with the SGP criterion next year and begin closing the long-run fiscal sustainability gap. A number of financial sector policy reforms legislated last year, including a new macroprudential policy framework, are now being implemented.
