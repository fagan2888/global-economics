While the financial system is small, the latest available indicators suggest some deterioration in banking sector soundness as the macroeconomic environment has weakened (Table 7). Financial system assets represented just 16 percent of GDP as of December 2015, or only 7 percent of CEMAC banks’ assets (versus a 15 percent share of CEMAC’s total GDP). It is dominated by a handful of commercial banks, with three banks holding close to two thirds of total assets. The ratio of NPLs to gross bank loans rose to 16.5 percent as of end-2015, a 5 percentage point increase from 2014. Returns on assets and on equity have also declined for two consecutive years. The capital adequacy ratio remained moderate at 14.6 percent as of end-2015 but well below the peak of 22 percent in 2013, while liquidity ratios remained favorable, with for instance liquid assets representing 26 percent of total assets. Going forward, with a dimmer domestic economic outlook there are significant risks to financial stability. The link between declining oil prices and deteriorating banking soundness indicators
