The Guatemalan economy continues its solid expansion. After emerging from the global financial crisis, activity rebounded quickly, spurred by domestic demand and supported by rising world export prices and counter-cyclical policies. Growth has now eased back to potential and the output gap is closed. Macroeconomic policies have stayed a prudent course, helping to maintain relatively low inflation. The financial system appears robust and the country’s current account deficit is stable and fully financed by FDI. The macro outlook is broadly positive. The main challenge is to unleash higher and more inclusive long-term growth, while enhancing resilience to shocks and preserving macroeconomic stability. Potential growth is constrained by weak investment in physical and human capital, and by the elevated crime and insecurity; poverty is widespread. Increasing high-quality public spending to support equitable growth is critical, but it will require boosting public revenue and strengthening expenditure management to safeguard macroeconomic stability. A nimbler handling of shocks would be allowed by widening the scope for counter-cyclical budget and monetary policies— fiscal space is currently limited by the very low tax burden, monetary space by downwards-sticky inflation expectations and dollarization. Upgrading the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, while monitoring carefully the rapid growth of credit, particularly in foreign currency, are important to safeguard financial stability.
