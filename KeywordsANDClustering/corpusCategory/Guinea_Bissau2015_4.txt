Creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty through sustained and inclusive growth are key objectives of the authorities’ medium-term policy framework. Under their development strategy for 2014–18, the authorities aim to reach these objectives by strengthening fiscal consolidation efforts through public financial management (PFM) and tax reforms, ensuring that economic policies support macroeconomic stability, stepping up implementation of structural reforms to improve the business environment, and enhancing human capital development by improving the quality of public service and access to education, health and social protection. The resumption of financial support from traditional development partners is critical for medium-term economic prospects and poverty reduction. The medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinning the ECF-supported program being requested by the authorities is consistent with their Strategic Plan (MEFP ¶¶12 and 13). It points to a favorable outlook with sustained growth, low inflation, and improving fiscal balances. The overall external position is expected to improve after a transitory worsening of the current account balance. Growth prospects for 2015–18 are supported by buoyant cashew nuts production and diversification of agriculture; public investment spending financed by development partners as per commitments from the Brussels Donor Roundtable in March 2015, and continued expansion of the communication and other services sectors. Baseline projections show that growth is expected to average 4.9 percent per year. Achievement of this growth profile relies heavily on realization of donor commitments at the Brussels Roundtable, which anticipates some US$1.5 billions to support the government’s 10-year development and transformation plan. Staff stressed that effective public investment management, and structural reforms to improve the business environment would be needed to further enhance medium-term growth prospects. Page 16 Inflation is expected to pick up as economic activity expands and incomes recover. Continued weakening in global food prices along with the authorities’ planned measures to support agricultural production and diversification would help dampen food inflation somewhat. Reflecting these expectations, average inflation is projected to increase to 1.3 percent in 2015, 2.3 percent in 2016 and average just under 3 percent in 2017–18 (Text Table 2 and Figure 4). While the current account deficit would increase in the next years, the overall external position would improve in the medium term. The external current account deficit is projected to widen to around 6 percent of GDP by 2018, owing to increased capital imports financed by increased foreign direct investment, project grants and highly concessional loans. With the increase in financial inflows, the overall balance of payments should improve (Text Table 2 and Figure 4). Text Table 2. Guinea-Bissau: Medium-Term Projections The economic outlook is favorable but subject to considerable risks (Appendix II). Downside risks could arise from adverse terms of trade, weakening of donor confidence, and unexpected political disruptions. At the same time, the heightened risk of incursion of the Ebola virus from neighboring countries into Guinea-Bissau, if realized, could impose significant human and economic costs on the economy and stall program implementation. On the upside, the risks stem from unexpected surges in business confidence on account of the success of the Brussels Roundtable, a stable political climate, and firmer commitment to policy implementation. The authorities agreed with staff’s medium-term projections and assessment of associated risks, but maintained that the growth prospects would be brighter than foreseen. They emphasized that with resumption of development partner support and the determination of the new government to implement reforms to improve the business environment, address the infrastructure gap, and enhance public service delivery, economic growth could rebound faster than in staff’s assessment. While acknowledging the possibility of the downside risks to the economic outlook, they accentuated the upside risks. They informed staff that they were taking measures, with support of development partners, to forestall the spread of the Ebola virus in Guinea-Bissau. 2014201520162017201820192020Real GDP growth (%)2.54.74.85.05.05.05.0 Real per capita income growth (%)0.32.42.52.72.72.72.7Consumer price inflation (%, annual average)-1.01.32.32.73.03.03.0Total revenue (incl. grants, % of GDP)21.018.719.918.919.319.720.1Total Expenditures (% of GDP)23.120.922.021.321.021.321.4Overall fiscal balance (incl. grants, commitment basis, % of GDP)-2.2-2.3-2.1-2.5-1.8-1.6-1.3Overall fiscal balance (excl. grants, commitment basis, % of GDP)-11.2-8.3-8.0-8.6-8.1-8.1-8.0External Current Account (incl. grants, % of GDP)-1.2-3.6-4.7-5.5-6.0-7.2-8.6Total Public Sector debt (Gross, % of GDP)51.950.949.548.746.444.342.1Source: IMF staff estimates Page 17
