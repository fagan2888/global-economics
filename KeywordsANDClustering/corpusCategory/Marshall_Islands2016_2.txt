Real GDP growth is estimated to have returned to a positive territory in FY2015, while CPI inflation has been falling . Overcoming the contraction of the previous year, the economy is estimated to have expanded by 0.4 percent in FY2015, as the fishery sector recovered. Following a moderate inflation of 1.1 percent in FY2014, headline inflation dropped to -2.2 percent in FY2015 amid falling oil and utility prices. Going forward, growth is expected to rise to 1.4 percent and inflation to 0.7 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought earlier this year are offset by the resumption of Compact-funded infrastructure spending. After several years of growth rebound fueled by the delayed implementation of infrastructure projects, GDP is projected to grow at the potential rate of 1–1.5 percent over the medium term, absent structural reforms. The overall fiscal balance, in surplus over FY2014–15, will likely deteriorate to a deficit over the medium term . The fiscal balance is estimated to have recorded a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP in FY2014–15, due to record-high fishing license fees. It is projected to decline to a smaller surplus in FY2016 and, without reforms, to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP over the medium term owing to the steady decline in Compact grants until FY2023, and sizable transfers to SOEs and the social security system. The current account deficit (including official grants) would likely worsen in FY2016 from an estimated 1.6 percent-of-GDP deficit in FY2015 . Weak copra and oil prices , and higher imports due to the resumption of infrastructure projects are projected to worsen the deficit in FY2016–17. Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding largely from the United States and grants from other donors. Banks provide only limited corporate credit despite ample deposits . Private sector credit reached nearly 50 percent of GDP in FY2015, mainly on account of consumer loans (corporate loans represent only 30 percent of total loans). A legislative framework for bankruptcy is missing, and posting property as collateral is hindered by complex land ownership issues. The loan-to-deposit ratio of the banking system remained low, at around 60 percent as of end-FY2015. Interest rate spreads (between lending and deposit rates) were around 5 percent for corporate loans and 13 percent for consumer loans, reflecting high credit risk.
