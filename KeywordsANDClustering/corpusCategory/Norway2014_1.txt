TRANSITION TO A NEW GROWTH MODEL Norwayâ€™s medium-term prospects remain favorable, but the economy faces potential challenges from the projected peak in oil-related activity in the mainland economy. Robust oil-related growth in recent years has masked slowing productivity growth in the mainland economy and the erosion of competitiveness. Estimates of output suggest that oil and gas production will pick up over the medium term but start to decline around 2021. However, the decline in investment and other demand from the oil and gas sector is expected to begin in 2015. Actions are needed to ensure that the mainland economy serves as a robust source of growth when offshore activity winds down.
