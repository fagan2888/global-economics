Growth is expected to regain momentum over the medium term, supported by infrastructure investment. Continued improvement in project implementation under the Kuwait Development Plan (DP) will support a gradual recovery in real nonoil GDP growth to about 3½ percent in 2017 and 4 percent thereafter. Hydrocarbon output is set to increase by 2 percent z – illi q ili q nu ili ili H L q illi L qu H q q H Page 13 annually, consistent with investment in the sector. Overall, real GDP growth would reach about 3 percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to increase to 4½ percent in 2017, reflecting energy prices increases in 2016–17, before easing gradually. Higher hydrocarbon exports will lift the current account surplus above 10 percent of GDP by 2021. The authorities were broadly in agreement with staff’s assessment of the macroeconomic outlook, but noted inflation could be lower next year based on the experience of other GCC countries. Kuwait’s fiscal position is projected to improve modestly, but financing needs after transfers to the FGF will remain large. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes oil prices will gradually recover to some $60 by 2021. It takes into account the fiscal impact of the measures recently enacted but does not factor in the government’s planned fiscal reforms that have yet to be implemented. Under this scenario, the fiscal balance (government definition) is projected to decline from about 17½ percent of GDP this year to 13 percent of GDP over the medium term, and cumulative gross financing needs would amount to about KD 35 billion over the next 6 years. These are assumed to be covered by a continued drawdown of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance to avoid crowding out private sector investment, and some external borrowing. The overall fiscal balance (before transfers to the FGF and including investment income) would post surpluses. This macro-fiscal environment is expected to remain broadly supportive of financial stability and credit growth. Growth-enhancing capital expenditures will support bank profitability and internal capital generation. Although there are downside risks to asset quality, loss absorption buffers are high. Staff agreed with the authorities’ view that while credit growth had been robust, the significant contribution of lower- risk installment loans mitigates concerns of a build-up of financial risks. The main risk to the outlook is a further sustained drop in oil prices, which would lead to higher financing needs and could set in motion unfavorable macro-financial dynamics Large fiscal deficits (Figure 6) would raise the gross financing requirement over the medium term (text table). Although the government’s strong credit rating (AA) would enable it to tap international markets, investors’ appetite for GCC bonds could decline in case of large regional financing needs. Kuwait would, therefore, be faced with the tradeoff of issuing more domestic debt, at the risk of Implementation of the recent OPEC agreement may lead to slightly lower hydrocarbon output increases than projected by staff in the short term—as it entails a cut of about 130 thousand mbd in 2017H1 compared to October levels. However, should the oil price increase of recent weeks be sustained, it would likely result in higher oil revenues. Page 14 squeezing domestic liquidity and crowding out private sector credit, or allowing readily available buffers to run lower. Staff and the authorities’ banking stress tests indicate that the financial system is resilient to severe credit and liquidity shocks. Nonetheless, a protracted period of lower oil prices—should it affect deposit growth, nonoil activity, stock market performance or real estate prices—could also heighten liquidity and credit risks (Box 3) and, in turn, credit and economic activity. Kuwait is also exposed to a number of other domestic and external risks (Annex III). Setbacks on fiscal consolidation measures would lead to higher financing needs. Slower project implementation under the development plan could weaken growth. While the country is only moderately exposed to regional spillovers, heightened security risks could affect investor confidence. More volatile global financial conditions could raise funding and market risks. In addition to the impact they could have through oil prices and financial markets conditions, significant changes to the post-election U.S. economic outlook could affect Kuwait through the exchange rate and interest rates. For example, a stronger U.S. dollar and a more rapid normalization of policy rates, may entail tighter monetary conditions given the Kuwaiti dinar peg. Outward spillovers, mainly through Kuwait’s contribution to global oil supply, investments abroad and remittances, are expected to be limited.
