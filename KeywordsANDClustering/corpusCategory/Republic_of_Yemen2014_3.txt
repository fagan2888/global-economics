Yemen’s medium-term outlook is largely predicated on the implementation of reforms under the ECF arrangement and on improvements in security . Growth is projected to recover gradually, reaching about 6 percent by 2018 partly reflecting utilization of the idle capacity created following the substantial slump of 2011, before decelerating somewhat to more moderate levels in the longer term. The planned increase in fuel prices in October is expected to raise inflation to the low double digits in late 2014 and throughout most of 2015. Inflation would then decline steadily starting in late 2015. The fiscal and external positions will improve gradually over the medium term as a result of reforms, the recovery of hydrocarbon exports, and upward revisions in the contracted low liquefied natural gas (LNG) export prices. Page 10 Timely implementation of reforms and concomitant donor support to the budget will be critical to this encouraging outlook . Delays in implementing reforms, particularly energy subsidy reforms, would destabilize the economy in the short run, and jeopardize the medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives. The outlook is also predicated on the implementation of other strong reforms to help reorient the budget structure from inefficient expenditures to pro- growth and pro-poor expenditures. These include, in particular, civil service reforms, improvements in tax policy and revenue administration, enhanced public financial management, and structural reforms to improve financial intermediation and the business environment. Timely donors’ support to the budget is also important, to reduce the crowding out of private sector credit, and to help catalyze domestic support for the reforms in the very difficult political and security environment. Global and country-specific risks to Yemen’s economic outlook are detailed in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Box 3). Political and security risks constitute the main challenges because they could further affect oil production, disrupt policy implementation, and discourage investment. The prospective shift to fiscal federalism, if not well-designed and supported by institution- and capacity-building, could present fiscal and debt challenges. On the upside, the outlook could benefit from the recent renegotiation of higher LNG prices and from a faster improvement in security and oil production. The broad representation of all major political parties in the coalition government reduces the risk of policy disruptions after the elections, which are likely to take place next year. A clear public communication of the necessity and benefits of reforms would also help ensure continued national ownership of the program and reduce the risks of policy slippages. Page 11 Figure 1.
