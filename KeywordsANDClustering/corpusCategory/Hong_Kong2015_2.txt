Risks are tilted to the downside (Appendix II) and arise from four main sources. High household and corporate leverage leave the private sector exposed to rising debt service costs in the event of a sharper- than-anticipated increase in interest rates. Spillovers from the Mainland have been strong and may intensify. The run-up in property prices over the past year raises the probability of a correction. Finally, there is a low probability-high impact risk of sharper-than-anticipated increases in interest rates coinciding with a faster- than-expected slowdown in Mainland China.
