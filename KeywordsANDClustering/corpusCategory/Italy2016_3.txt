The discussions focused on policies to deliver stronger and more inclusive growth while strengthening buffers. Even with the benefit of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, notably easier fiscal policy, relatively low global commodity prices, and the launch of important reforms, growth is expected to remain relatively modest, public debt very high, and financial sector vulnerabilities elevated in the near to medium-term. Substantial progress must therefore be made in addressing these challenges. The authorities are keen to stay the course, prioritizing growth, including through fiscal accommodation, and avoiding exacerbating financial deleveraging, not least because a step up in growth could facilitate bank balance sheet cleanup and lower the debt burden. Yet, unless growth increases notably, such a strategy could well leave a greater risk of a future procyclical tightening in the event of adverse shocks. Staff suggested that consideration be given to deeper structural reforms and a pro-growth fiscal policy mix that can create space for earlier fiscal adjustment and stronger financial sector policies. This will help build buffers faster, and any impact on near-term growth would be compensated by stronger resilience to shocks and a higher growth payoff in the medium term. Page 20
