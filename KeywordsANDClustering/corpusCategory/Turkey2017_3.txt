The overarching goals are: (1) avoiding an excessive slowdown of the economy; and (2) addressing external imbalances and reducing inflation . The growth slowdown and the Lira depreciation have put pressure on non-financial corporations and could ultimately generate risks for the financial sector. Avoiding an adverse loop between the slowing economy, large depreciation, and private balance sheets is the immediate goal. Addressing the external imbalances remains the main medium-term priority, requiring macro policies and structural reforms to increase private saving and reduce dependence on external financing. These challenges call in the short run for a broadly neutral monetary stance—to the extent consistent with orderly FX market conditions—and a moderately looser fiscal stance. Monetary policy tightening could be required to prevent excessive Lira volatility in the short-run and contain its spillovers to inflation. Use of some fiscal space could help cushion the impact of negative shocks and possible tighter liquidity conditions on the economy. Financial sector policies should aim at preserving financial stability via maintaining a robust macroprudential regime, including measures to lower foreign exchange risk in the economy, and further strengthening supervision and bank governance.
