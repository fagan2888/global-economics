Macroeconomic developments in 2013 were broadly satisfactory. Growth fell to 3.3 percent in 2013, on declining oil production from aging oil wells. Non-oil growth continued to be buoyed by favorable developments in the agriculture, construction, and services sectors. Inflation decelerated to 2.1 percent in December 2013 (y/y), down from 7.5 percent a year earlier, aided by lower food prices and CFA franc appreciation against the U.S. dollar. The overall fiscal balance remained in surplus in 2013 at 5.8 percent of GDP (13.9 percent of non-oil GDP), up from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Notwithstanding continued high international oil prices, oil revenues declined by almost 11 percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting declining production and export volumes. The basic non-oil primary balance (defined as the non-oil primary balance net of grants and foreign-financed capital spending) improved by about 19.5 percentage points of non-oil GDP to a deficit of 43.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013. Domestically-financed capital spending was broadly in line with the budgeted amount and represented a decline of 9.9 percentage points of non-oil GDP. Current expenditures on transfers and common charges fell short of the budget and declined by 7.7 percentage points of non-oil GDP. Non-oil tax revenues over performed owing to rising non-oil private sector imports and Page 7 customs administration reforms that are being undertaken, including the establishment of a one-stop window for customs clearance. Foreign-financed capital spending increased by 6.7 percentage points of non-oil GDP to 18.7 percent of non-oil GDP as the execution rate improved to about 70 percent of the budget, up from 54 percent in 2012. Domestic arrears payments amounted to 6.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013, a near doubling from 2012. The bulk of domestic arrears involve pension arrears and unpaid social benefits, which started accumulating after the liquidation of public enterprises in the past as dismissed employees were not fully compensated. The fiscal rule introduced by the authorities in 2013 was breached owing to settlement of unbudgeted domestic arrears. Under the rule, CFAF 1,500 billion of oil revenue would be spent (CFAF 1,000 billion on domestically financed capital expenditure and CFAF 500 billion on current expenditure). The remainder would be saved. Accordingly, from the oil revenues of CFAF 2,295 billion that materialized in 2013, CFAF 795 billion should have been saved. Instead, savings amounting to about CFAF 629 billion (9.4 percent of GDP) were added to the government’s deposits in China (Box 1). The 2014 budget envisages a decline in the surplus to 3.3 percent of GDP and again targets government spending of about 100 percent of non-oil GDP: An increase in the wage bill from hiring of new civil servants. The wage bill is budgeted to increase by 18 percent in 2014 and by about 12 percent per year over the 2015–17 period, reflecting the government’s agreement with labor unions to raise salaries by 50 percent from 2013 to 2016 as well as their plan to hire qualified educators and health-care workers. A sizable increase in capital spending reflecting among other things: (i) the government’s efforts to implement the NDP; (ii) ongoing construction and rehabilitation efforts related to the 2012 ammunition explosion; (iii) the urbanization program ( municipalisation accélérée ); and (iv) the need to build the infrastructure and facilities for the 2015 All Africa Games. A modest increase in non-oil revenue, including from additional one-stop windows for customs clearance. Against the backdrop of high oil prices, the overall balance of payments (BOP) remains in surplus. The fiscal accounts suggest that the government’s bank deposits in China increased in 2013. Despite declining for the second year in a row, the Republic of Congo’s reserves at the BEAC continue to cover about 7 months of prospective imports of goods and services. The ongoing stagnation in non–oil exports raises competitiveness concerns (Annex 2). Competitiveness has been affected by the 11 percent appreciation of the Republic of Congo’s real effective exchange rate (REER) from the 2012 average. This is a result of the strengthening of the euro (to which the regional currency, the CFAF, is pegged) and the relatively higher inflation than in trading partners. Competitiveness constraints also arise from the challenging overall business environment that lags most countries in the world and regional peers (Figure 2) and the large social and infrastructure gaps.

Congo’s Economic Relationship with China China has become the Republic of Congo’s most important development partner (Table 1). It has operations ranging from development financing, direct investment, and technical assistance. It is also an important trading partner. Currently, more than one-third of Congo’s annual oil and timber–the two major export commodities–are exported to China; and Congo ranks among the top five major African trading partners of China. Table 1. The Role of China in Congo’s Public Investments Chinese project loans in percent of: Non-oil GDP Total government capital expenditure Source: Congolese authorities and IMF staff calculations China’s financial assistance to the Republic of Congo has been growing significantly since 2006. The cooperation with China has been supported by the 2006 strategic partnership agreement, which envisioned concessional loans of about US$1.6 billion for key infrastructure projects. A second concessional agreement with total disbursements of US$1 billion during 2013–16, is expected to sustain infrastructure investments. Congo’s borrowing from China is on concessional terms —carrying a 5-year grace period, 20 years maturity and a 0.25 percent interest rate. As a guarantee for the loans, the Congolese authorities are required to keep a minimum deposit balance equivalent to about twenty percent of total outstanding loans in an escrow account in China’s EXIM Bank from the proceeds of their oil sales to China. In recent years, the higher remuneration on deposits at the EXIM Bank compared with government deposits at the BEAC (currently less than one percent) has encouraged Congolese government deposits in China. Following three years of very rapid growth, commercial banks’ credit to the private sector decelerated to 27 percent in March 2014 (y/y) amid declining deposit growth. However, at less than 12 percent of GDP, the outstanding stock of credit to the private sector remains among the lowest in SSA. Commercial banks lowered their lending rates from 13–14 percent in recent years to around 7–10 percent in early 2014, reflecting excess liquidity in the banking system from lack of lending opportunities as well as the 75 basis point reduction in the BEAC’s policy rate since October 2013 External public debt has continued to trend upward. It reached 32 percent of GDP in 2013, up from 20 percent of GDP in 2010, when the Republic of Congo obtained HIPC/MDRI debt relief. Most of Congo’s borrowing is on concessional terms from China and is targeted at financing key infrastructure projects (Box 1). Page 11 Figure 2.
