Latvia has made remarkable economic progress since the financial crisis. The output gap has almost closed; unemployment, although still high, is now mainly structural in nature; and the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The current account—which was more than 20 percent of GDP in deficit just before the output collapse—is close to balance. Fiscal policy is prudent, and public debt is among the lowest in Europe. The country experienced a smooth entry into the Euro Area. Going forward, policy continuity is likely, as the incumbent center-right coalition remains in power following parliamentary elections last October. The 2014 Article IV consultation commended the authorities for prudent macroeconomic policies, but argued for an extensive medium-term agenda of structural reforms. The staff appraisal recommended gradual fiscal consolidation in line with the Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL); measures to reduce inequality and strengthen the social safety net; structural reforms to boost productivity; and close supervision of non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system. Policy making has broadly reflected these recommendations. Fiscal policy has been in line with the FDL, and some measures, such as raising the minimum non- taxable allowance under the income tax, have targeted vulnerable sections of society. The electricity sector has been liberalized, and close supervision of NRD-specialized banks continues.
