Economic activity slowed in 2013, but has rebounded in 2014 . GDP growth for 2013 is estimated at 4.1 percent, as below average rainfall and the regional security situation held back growth despite the rapid expansion of oil production, reaching an average of 18,000 barrels per day from 13,000 barrels per day in 2012. Growth is estimated at 6.5 percent in 2014, largely driven by agriculture and government infrastructure projects, while inflation remains subdued (Table 1). Production at the largest uranium mine was interrupted for two months due to a terrorist attack. Page 7 Government food programs helped alleviate the impact of the poor harvest in 2013, with inflation remaining low . Government food programs designed to alleviate food insecurity were effective in offsetting the poor harvest in 2013. These programs include the creation of cereal stocks, the sale of subsidized cereals, the targeted distribution of free food, and the 3N initiative ( les Nigeriens Nourrisent Les Nigeriens ) mainly aimed at fostering agricultural production. The authorities estimated the total cost of domestic food programs in 2013 to be around CFAF 112 billion, of which about only CFAF 13 billion were covered by donors. The authorities reported that donors’ support fell short because of competitive demand at the international level (Syrian, Libyan, Central African Republic crises). Inflation, dominated by swings in food prices, was contained to 2.3 percent in 2013 (Table 1) and 1.3 percent in June 2014. The fiscal deficit narrowed in 2013, reflecting under-execution of expenditures, but the fiscal position has deteriorated in 2014 . Despite a shortfall in uranium fiscal receipts, total revenue increased by 1.2 percentage points of GDP in 2013, mainly reflecting progress in revenue administration and exceptional revenue from the oil sector (approximately CFAF 20 billion, 0.6 percent of GDP). To compensate for higher security-related spending (CFAF 38.9 billion in 2013, 1.1 percent of GDP), the authorities contained the increase in capital expenditures (Tables 2, 3). The overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis, including external grants) was 2.7 percent of GDP compared with the program projection of 5.6 percent, mainly reflecting under-execution of capital expenditure. The authorities reduced domestic arrears by CFAF 22.4 billion or 0.6 percent of GDP in 2013. Reflecting continued expenditure pressures and weak revenues at end-June 2014, the basic fiscal deficit has widened, but arrears reduction was CFAF 9.5 billion. To address critical vulnerabilities, the authorities have sought to scale up infrastructure spending through increased borrowing . Scheduled bond issuances on the regional market amount to CFAF 275 billion in 2014-2016. Bond issuance receipts will be partly used for additional infrastructure investments to reduce flooding risks and food insecurity, for increased capacity in the education and health sectors, and to offset revenue shortfall from the security situation in neighboring countries and the resulting terrorist activities adversely affecting trade flows. Amounts of CFAF 93.3 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) were already issued in 2014. The remainder of the bonds will be issued in the next two years, of which CFAF 121 billion in 2015 and CFAF 61 billion in 2016. A master facility of US$1 billion was signed with China EximBank on September 30, 2013 and approved by the National Assembly; the facility is earmarked for infrastructure projects. Growth in monetary aggregates slowed in 2013, but increased at end-June 2014, reflecting improved economic activity (Table 4). The expansion of broad money and credit to the economy decelerated considerably in 2013, driven by lower GDP growth and a reduction in short-term credit. At end-June 2014, broad money increased by 10.7 percent relative to end-2013, The government collected CFAF 59 billion (1.6 percent of GDP) from the sale of exploration rights in the Agadem block, including approximately CFAF 20 billion in fiscal revenue.

This evolution of the external position mainly depicts the level of repatriation of export earnings from mining and oil, mobilization of external financing and subscriptions by regional banks for securities issued by Niger on the regional bond market and the recovery of recorded fund mobilization by mining companies. Inflows were however tempered by outflows for payments of imports of goods and services and debt service. At the end of June 2014, domestic credit increased by 11.9 percent relative to December 2013; credit has been mainly allocated to trade, transport and telecommunications, public works, and manufacturing, including water and electricity. The current account deficit remains large . The current account deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP in 2013 (compared to 18.7 percent in 2012—Table 5). This reflects the fact that the growth of exports was outpaced by the rise in imports of goods and services related to investment projects in the extractive industries and public works. The overall balance has resulted in a large surplus owing to high foreign direct investments and project grants and loans leading to an increase of Niger’s contribution to the net foreign assets of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). End-June 2014 monetary survey suggests a surplus of the balance of payments of CFAF 26.6 million.
