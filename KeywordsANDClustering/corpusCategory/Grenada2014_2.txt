PROGRAM The authorities and staff agree on the importance of restoring fiscal sustainability, while creating supportive conditions for high-quality growth . The authorities have developed a comprehensive policy agenda that seeks to: (i) enhance competitiveness to promote private sector growth and employment, through the implementation of structural reform; (ii) resolve the fiscal crisis through fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring, while protecting social safety nets; and (iii) strengthen financial sector stability by enhancing regulation and supervision. Page 14 The authorities’ policy framework draws on the lessons learned from the recent ex- post assessment (EPA) of Fund engagement with Grenada The EPA found that performance under the two latest Fund-supported programs was affected by the difficulties of tackling major natural and economic shocks, while facing institutional challenges characteristic of small countries. The main lessons pointed to overoptimistic growth projections, a large number of structural reform measures that exceeded Grenada’s capacity constraints, and weak program ownership. The EPA concluded that new Fund engagement would benefit from (i) a clear ownership and track record demonstrated through prior actions and indicative targets; (ii) a focus on only few macro-critical reforms, with greater emphasis on growth with assistance by the World Bank and Caribbean Development Bank; (iii) a significant fiscal adjustment, with reductions in the wage bill and efforts to scale back tax incentives; (iv) policy buffers and built-in flexibility to deal with likely shocks, as well as (v) realistic growth projections.
