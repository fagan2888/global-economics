Tax reforms could increase potential growth, enhance fairness, and improve efficiency. Despite progress in recent years, the Dutch tax and benefit system remains unbalanced; significant efficiency gains could be achieved by shifting the tax burden away from labor, and towards consumption and capital income, in particular on residential property ownership. This makes some sense on distributional grounds as well; Dutch households have high net wealth on average, but— excluding pension entitlements—it is unevenly distributed and most of the assets are in illiquid real estate and pension accounts. The European Commission methods show a smaller output gap than estimates by staff or the authorities with the result that there is a structural deficit instead of approximate balance. This topic is considered in detail in the Selected Issues paper: Tax Reform in the Netherlands: Moving Closer to Best Practices. Page 14 The authorities have recently taken a number of steps in the right direction. For example, they have decided to gradually phase out some of the large subsidies on housing investment and pension savings and to roll back some of the regressive features of the taxation of capital income. Also, the 2016 €5 billion labor tax cut package is mainly targeted at female workers and low-wage earners—the most responsive groups to labor taxation in the Netherlands— which should help create new jobs and increase hours worked. But more could be done and faster. In particular, the tax preferences on pension income could be reduced and the current large subsidies on home ownership could be phased-out more quickly than currently envisaged, allowing a budget-neutral and growth-enhancing rapid reduction of the labor tax wedge. Moreover, important tax revenue and efficiency gains would result from harmonizing the currently fragmented capital income and value-added tax schemes. Taxes should be levied on actual returns on assets as opposed to presumptive returns, allowing greater fairness and better anti-cyclical properties of the taxation system. The current tax system favors debt and has contributed to overly-leveraged households and firms. Interest deductibility has favored debt over equity financing, resulting in excessive leverage, exacerbating business cycles and potentially threatening financial and fiscal sustainability. Future tax reforms should minimize this debt bias. The Dutch authorities have already taken some measures to foster a gradual deleveraging in the housing sector (e.g., decreasing loan- to-value (LTV) ratios and mortgage interest deductibility (MID)). Similar measures should be taken in the corporate sector. For example, an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) could be introduced and calibrated so that equity and debt finance become fiscally neutral to encourage equity building. A similar type of allowance could, in principle, also be introduced in the housing sector; revenue shortfalls could be offset through broadening the VAT base and unifying VAT rates. The OECD and G20 recommendations on international corporate taxation to limit Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) will deploy their first effects in 2016. The Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (CITA 1969) will be modified to include supplementary transfer pricing documentation requirements in line with the three-tiered approach of Action 13 of the OECD BEPS project. Under the draft law (September 2015), the Country-by-Country (CbC) report, the master file and local file requirements will be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2016. The Tax Administration also plans to start exchanging information on rulings in 2016 (Action 5), and to adopt the new minimum standards to prevent treaty abuse (Action 6) and the criteria to define permanent establishment (Action 7) once incorporated into the update of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Numerous studies have tried to measure the impact of taxation on leverage and yielded widely different results. Methodologies vary and the results are sensitive to the debt maturity, the design of the tax system and other country specific factors. A meta-analysis of the empirical literature (R. De Mooij, “The Tax Elasticity of Corporate Debt: A Synthesis of Size and Variations”, IMF working paper WP 11/95, 2011) concluded that 1pp increase in the corporate income tax rate could increase the debt-equity ratio up to 0.28 percent. In other words, a country with a CIT rate of 25 percent—like the Netherlands—would see the average corporate debt–asset ratio fall by 7 percentage points (0.25x0.28) if it fully eliminated the corporate tax advantage of debt. Page 15 Box 1. Tax Structure in the Netherlands—An International Comparison The current tax system tends to overload taxpayers by discouraging labor supply and shrinking the tax base. Labor income taxation is doing the heavy lifting in terms of revenue collection and income redistribution. When including social security contributions, labor income taxation is comparatively elevated in the Netherlands (with respect to European counterparts), and features a very progressive tax scale and dissuasively high marginal tax- and-benefit schemes for low income workers—in particular mothers. At the same time, capital income taxation is one of the lightest in the European union, and indirect taxation—a potentially efficient revenue collection instrument—does not carry its share of the load (see table and figures). There is substantial scope for a reallocation of the tax burden from labor to capital, in particular housing. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that taxing pensions as ordinary savings (€14 billion), removing the tax subsidy for housing (€6 billion), and unifying VAT at the standard rate (€8 billion) could increase (ex-ante) revenues by roughly 4 percent of GDP.

They agreed about the desirability of a shift in tax burden from labor to other taxes less harmful to economic growth. They noted that the 2016 tax reductions on labor taxes were a move in the right direction, especially due to targeting the lower tax wedge on groups with the highest labor supply elasticity. However, they expressed some reservations about taxing the actual returns on assets, which is in the political spotlight. Although they recognized that it is the most fair and least distorting way to tax capital income, it would entail a much greater burden of record-keeping than their own proposed reform of the wealth tax. The authorities will investigate whether it will be feasible to tax actual returns in the near future. They agreed in principle on raising VAT taxes on items not currently charged at the standard rate, but noted the lack of political support and that they are constrained to some extent by EU rules in this regard. They agreed that a reduction in the debt bias in personal and corporate tax is in principle also desirable, and noted the gradual reduction in MID that is already underway, but had concerns that faster reduction in MID could undercut the housing recovery. They have not included measures such as an allowance for corporate equity to reduce the debt in corporate taxation, and they have noted that corporate taxation needs to be reformed in a coordinated manner with other EU and advanced economies.
