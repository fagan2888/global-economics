Mexico has faced a complex global environment over the last year. International oil prices declined by more than 50 percent since mid-2014. The drop in oil prices has had a limited impact on the current account as Mexico has a broadly balanced trade in hydrocarbons. However, it increased the fiscal consolidation burden and might affect prospects for private investment in the oil sector in the medium term. In addition, emerging market asset prices were hit by a rise in global financial volatility and a portfolio shift away from emerging markets. As a consequence, the Mexican peso has depreciated sharply against the US dollar since mid-2014, prompting the Foreign Exchange Commission to put in place a rules-based foreign exchange intervention program. Despite the increase in asset price volatility, economic activity continues to grow at a steady pace, and inflation remains low and stable. In the context of high financial market volatility, policies in Mexico remain focused on maintaining strong fundamentals and safeguarding financial stability. The flexible exchange rate has helped the economy adjust to external shocks. The authorities have reiterated their commitment to reduce public sector deficits and stabilize public debt. Continued implementation of a broad range of structural reforms would help lift potential growth over the medium term.
