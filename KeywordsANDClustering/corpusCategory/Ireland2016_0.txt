Ireland’s economy has rebounded exceptionally, but the recovery is incomplete and crisis legacies still pose challenges. Ireland’s growth outperformed that of its peers during 2014- 15, bringing real GDP at end-2015 ten percent above its pre-crisis level. The robust economic growth was supported by favorable external conditions, and was accompanied by improved balance sheets, a strengthening banking sector, steady job creation, and rising incomes and asset prices. Policy implementation has been strong (Annex I). Nevertheless, the recovery is unfinished and has yet to benefit parts of the population. Moreover, elevated public and private sector debts and a large stock of banks’ distressed loans leave the economy susceptible to shocks.

The newly-elected government needs to maintain the economic policy course and tackle crisis legacies to achieve durable and inclusive long-term growth. The minority coalition that was formed in May 2016 following the February general election consists of the former incumbent party, Fine Gael, and independents. The importance of preserving economic recovery and safeguarding public finances is widely shared, and the broad policy course is likely to be continued. Nevertheless, the increased political fragmentation and reform fatigue may complicate policymaking and the fallout from the UK vote to leave the EU could do so too.
