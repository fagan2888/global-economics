The economy is decelerating gradually (Figure 1). Real GDP growth is estimated to have declined to around 3¬º percent in 2014 from 4¬Ω percent in 2013. Private consumption growth has geared down from its torrid pace in 2010‚Äì11 but has remained robust. Private investment is moderating from record high levels. Although commodity exports were solid in 2014, the growth of overall export receipts has slowed down markedly from a few years ago. Weak economic conditions in Argentina, in particular, have continued to weigh on Uruguay‚Äôs external services balance and current account (Figure 2).

Page 8 The surge in nonresident purchases of local securities has abated and the Uruguayan peso has depreciated towards levels consistent with fundamentals The peso has weakened by about 30 percent against the U.S. dollar and 7 percent in real effective terms since the Fed‚Äôs May 2013 tapering announcement, broadly in line with the trends in the region. Noting the reversal of appreciation pressures, the authorities eased the reserve requirements on nonresident purchases of public debt securities in September 2014. They also intervened in the foreign exchange market, selling about US$500 million in forward contracts in the second half of 2014. International reserves remain comfortably above norms and the exchange rate slightly on the strong side of fundamentals (0‚Äì5 percent, Annex I). Inflation remains above the central bank‚Äôs 3‚Äì7 percent target range (Figure 1). After being pushed to near 10 percent in early 2014 by food price shocks and the pass-through of peso depreciation, consumer price (CPI) inflation eased to 8¬º percent at the end of the year. The easing in inflation was due to one-off measures and subdued increases in administered prices enabled in part by lower electricity generation costs. Core CPI inflation, which excludes fruit, vegetable, and administered price inflation, remains around 10 percent. Above target inflation reflects a shrinking but still positive output gap, upward shocks to food and fuel prices in 2010‚Äì13, and pervasive backward- looking wage indexation that embedded these shocks. Against a backdrop of upward pressures on inflation, and a period of accommodative monetary policy during the 2011‚Äì 13 capital inflow surge, inflation expectations have not been anchored within the target range. The one-off measures in force since March 2014, estimated to subtract about ¬Ω percentage point from the CPI for a temporary period, include reduced VAT on fruits, vegetables, and energy and telephone tariffs, a subsidy on health care contributions, and lower lottery prices. Core CPI excludes these effects. 170Jun-13Dec-13Jun-14Dec-14 Exchange Rates Against the U.S. Dollar (Index 100= May 1st, 2013) Argentina 1/ Chile Colombia Mexico Source: Bloomberg L.P. 1/ Simple weekly average of officialand informal market rates. 46810124681012Jan-12Aug-12Mar-13Oct-13May-14Dec-14 Headline Inflation Core Inflation Consumer Prices (Y-o-y, in percent)Sources: Haver Analytics and Fund staff calculations. Page 9 Monetary policy has been tight while fiscal policy has been slightly expansionary in (Figure 3). Since the introduction of money growth targets in July 2013, the growth rate of M1 plus savings deposits (M1+) has declined from around 14 percent in the previous year to about 7 percent in 2014Q3 and the peso yield curve has hovered 400‚Äì500 basis points above its level prior to July 2013. Reflecting the monetary policy tightening as well as cooling demand, a slowdown now appears to be taking hold for both peso and FX loans. Current fiscal spending has continued to grow faster than real GDP in 2014, implying an expansionary fiscal policy stance. The budget approved for 2015 will keep central government discretionary spending constant in nominal terms‚Äîin line with a convention for post- election years. This, together with a moderation of investment by public enterprises and a strengthening of their operating balances, will improve the public sector primary balance by ¬æ percentage point of GDP.

Bank resilience indicators are generally strong, with non-performing loans (NPLs) at less than 2 percent of total loans, total loan-loss provisions on average three times larger than NPLs, and net foreign exchange positions below 1 percent of capital. Nonetheless, a few indicators of soundness are less strong than they were a few years ago (Figure 4). In particular, foreign currency credit to borrowers in the nontradables sector has increased as a share of total credit, banks‚Äô capital buffers have declined somewhat, and the share of NPLs has inched up in 2014. Bank profitability remains subdued given high deposit dollarization and high U.S. dollar liquidity, low interest rates on U.S. dollar assets, and high operating costs. In December 2012, capital requirements were modified to cover operational risks and capital surcharges were established for systemically important banks (0.5-2.0 percentage points). The profitability indicators (ROA and ROE) for 2014 are held down by an inflation adjustment to fixed assets as accumulated inflation exceeded the threshold of 25 percent in the previous 3 years. Excluding this adjustment, profitability indicators are largely unchanged from end-2013. Banks‚Äô net worth is not affected by this adjustment. 2010201120122013 2014 1/LA5 2/ Regulatory capital in percent of risk-weighted assets16.113.712.811.712.815.6Non-performing loans in percent of total loans 1.01.31.51.31.62.9Non-performing loans in percent of total household loans3.53.13.53.73.6‚Ä¶Specific loan-loss provisions in percent of non-performing loans 73.171.169.056.261.6‚Ä¶Operating costs in percent of gross income91.383.481.083.186.4‚Ä¶Return on assets 3/0.80.81.01.60.92.0Return on equity 4/8.17.912.619.712.019.3Liquidity ratio 5/47.447.852.652.656.830.6Dollar loans in percent of total loans59.458.557.959.660.922.1Dollar deposits in percent of total deposits 74.171.971.973.577.621.7Non-resident deposits in percent of total deposits16.414.615.215.014.7‚Ä¶Private sector credit in percent of GDP 6/19.720.122.123.324.636.3Household consumer credit in percent of GDP 6/8.48.38.79.09.5‚Ä¶Implicit exchange rate risk 6/ 7/26.029.028.029.731.0‚Ä¶Memorandum items:Loan dollarization (constant exchange rate, January 2013)50.852.952.351.450.2‚Ä¶Deposit dollarization (constant exchange rate, January 2013)68.667.267.467.270.0‚Ä¶1/ Latest available data (August 2014).3/ Annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes, from the beginning of the year until the reporting 6/ For 2014, latest available data (2014Q2).7/ Foreign currency bank credit to borrowers without natural hedges as a share of total bank loans to the private sector.
