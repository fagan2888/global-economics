The Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) won the general election in February 2016, defeating the incumbent People’s National Party by one parliamentary seat. The new government took office in March with a mandate to boost growth and reduce the tax burden for the low and middle income groups. Prime Minister Holness has stated the government’s intention is to continue with the IMF-supported program to build on the macroeconomic stability achieved thus far, including by maintaining the fiscal targets of the program while supporting inclusive growth.
