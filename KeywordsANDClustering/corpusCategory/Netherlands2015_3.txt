Fiscal policy was broadly neutral in 2015 and is expected to slightly tighten in The recovery helped keep the headline deficit relatively stable in the 2.2–2.4 percent of GDP range in 2013–15, with a slight deterioration in the structural balance. The draft 2016 budget reduces labor and income taxes by €5 billion (about 0.7 percent of GDP) while pursuing the expenditure-based path of fiscal consolidation. General government debt will decline from 67 percent to 66 percent of GDP between 2015 and 2016. Both the headline deficit and the pace of debt reduction are comfortably within the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) limits.

Page 13 There is fiscal space in economic terms, but perhaps less in SGP terms . Staff calculations show a structural deficit only slightly larger than the MTO of a 0.5 percent of GDP deficit, based on output gap estimates in line with the authorities’ ones However, the authorities note that the European Commission’s (EC) approach to the calculation, based on a smaller and more rapidly closing output gap, shows structural deficits close to 1 percentage point above the MTO in 2015 and However, because the SGP rules are defined in terms of the EC approach, Fund staff and other alternative estimates are of limited relevance in assessing fiscal space under the SGP. Dutch fiscal policy should support the recovery to the extent possible. Should calculations of the deficit for 2016 change or if there is still a significant output or employment gap in 2017, staff recommends that the authorities make use of this space to support the recovery. The authorities could use any available fiscal space to catch up on deferred spending priorities. For example, public research and development spending is low in comparison to EU Member States at similar levels of development (e.g., Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden), and it is assumed to decrease further. Also, the authorities should consider using any available fiscal space under the SGP to accommodate refugee-related costs without cutting other priority spending. However, in the medium- and long-term as the output gap closes, consolidation should resume to rebuild fiscal buffers, including by reducing public debt below 60 percent of GDP. Given that the fiscal stance is at the limit of that permitted under the SGP, the authorities do not see fiscal space . While the deficit is well below 3 percent of GDP and the reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio is more than sufficient to meet SGP requirements, the structural balance calculated using the European Commission approach, exceeds the MTO by nearly a percentage point in 2016. They also noted the substantial increases in public debt in the course of the financial crisis and recession. In this context, they noted that it would be important to reduce public debt to levels well below 60 percent of GDP to restore fiscal buffers.
