The Israeli economy is growing at a moderate pace Following a strong expansion in 2010–11, real GDP growth moderated to 3½ percent in 2012 and 2013. As a result, the positive output gap has dissipated. Excluding the impact of natural gas, growth was more moderate, at about 2½ percent in 2013. Inflation remains subdued. Headline CPI inflation, underlying inflation (CPI excluding energy price), and market-based inflation expectations have all remained at around the mid-point of the 1–3 percent target range (Figure 4). Notwithstanding tax and food price increases, soft domestic demand, coupled with the appreciation of the shekel and deregulation (e.g. cellular telecom industry), has contained inflationary pressures. Unemployment remains low at about 6 percent, but wage pressures remain contained. House prices have, however, risen sharply. The low interest rate environment and a search for yield have boosted the demand for housing, even as chronic shortages of planned land and delays in the process of obtaining building permits have constrained supply. As a result, house prices have sky-rocketed (an increase of 80 percent in nominal terms since 2007). Natural gas production at Tamar came on stream in the second quarter of 2013.

Proj. Page 7 The external position remains strong (Tables 2-3). Foreign reserves have risen to $82 billion (192 percent of short-term external debt), and the surplus on the net international investment position is high at about 22 percent of GDP. The US government guarantee program for Israeli sovereign bonds was extended to 2016 in July 2012, providing additional assurance ($3.8 billion of the total of $9 billion is untapped). The shekel has appreciated sharply, up some 12 percent in real effective terms over the past 15 months. Growth momentum is expected to remain moderate Staff expects growth (excluding the contribution of gas) to increase to 3 percent in 2014, reflecting some recovery in investment. However, growth momentum is expected to remain moderate, as planned fiscal tightening and shekel appreciation would weigh on the economy and offset, in part, the pick-up in demand in Israeli trading partners. In the baseline scenario, the output gap (excluding the impact of gas production) is expected to widen slightly, unemployment to edge up to just above 6½ percent, and inflation to remain within the 1–3 percent target range. Beyond 2014, growth over the medium term is projected at around 3½ percent annually (excluding the impact of gas production), much lower than the annual average of 4¼ percent over the past 10 years. This reflects, in part, an anticipated reduction in labor force growth (as baby boomers are reaching retirement ages).

Page 8 Risks to the outlook are mainly to the downside Israel is a small open economy, with its exports divided roughly evenly among the US, Europe, and emerging Asia. Financial links to the rest of the world through the banking channel are limited, but Israel does receive a significant amount of FDI inflows, notably from the US and Europe. Indeed, following a dip in 2009, FDI inflows have surged and remain the dominant component of the capital account. By contrast, portfolio inflows, which rose rapidly in 2010, have since then declined sharply in magnitude—owing to a narrowing of interest rate differentials and the removal of tax exemption on capital gains for foreign investors—but remain volatile (Annex I). Externally, the main downside risks pertain to a protracted period of sluggish growth in Europe and the United States and growth disappointments in emerging economies (Annex II). Given the limited financial links to the rest of the world, relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals, and the predominance of stable FDI inflows, risks related to volatility in global financial markets, are less of a concern for Israel. In this context, an exit from unconventional monetary policies in major advanced economies may actually alleviate appreciation pressures on the shekel and pose upside risks to growth prospects. Domestic risks include a further weakening of the competitiveness of the tradable sector, a correction in the housing market, with attendant implications for the fiscal position and the financial sector, and the reemergence of regional geopolitical tensions, which would bear upon sentiment. Risks to the upside could arise from faster-than-expected recovery in Israel’s major trading partners and larger than anticipated spillovers from the natural gas sector.
