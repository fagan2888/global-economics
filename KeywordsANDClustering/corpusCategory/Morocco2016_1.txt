Decisive policies and reforms have helped improve macroeconomic conditions in recent years, but important challenges remain in raising growth and employment. The authorities have successfully reduced domestic and external vulnerabilities, enhanced the fiscal and financial policy frameworks, and supported economic diversification (see Annex I). As a result, fiscal and current account deficits have declined, and the medium-term outlook is favorable. Yet, external risks remain elevated, and continued efforts are needed to further reduce vulnerabilities and promote stronger and more inclusive growth. The IMF supports the authoritiesâ€™ program through the successor two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement approved in July 2016. This arrangement provides insurance against external risks and supports efforts to strengthen fiscal sustainability, transition toward greater exchange rate flexibility, and promote higher growth so as to reduce unemployment.
