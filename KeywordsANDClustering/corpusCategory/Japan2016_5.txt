Under current policies, the high nominal growth goal, the inflation target, and the primary budget surplus objective all remain out of reach within the timeframe set by the authorities. A comprehensive and coordinated policy upgrade, centered on income policies, would significantly increase chances of achieving Abenomicsâ€™ ambitious targets. In the absence of such a reload, targets and policy frameworks would need a reset to be consistent with a protracted adjustment process. More unorthodox policy packages could pay dividends, but entail unacceptable risks at the current juncture.
