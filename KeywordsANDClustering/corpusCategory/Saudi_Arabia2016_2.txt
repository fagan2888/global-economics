Real GDP growth was broadly unchanged in 2015 at 3.5 percent . Non-oil growth slowed to 3.1 percent in 2015 from 4.8 percent in 2014—non-oil public sector GDP contracted by close to 9 percent (y/y) in 2015Q4—but was offset by stronger oil sector growth of 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2.1 percent in 2014 (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Monthly indicators suggest that non-oil private sector activity weakened in early 2016. Corporate profitability and the stock market have fallen over past year, although corporate balance sheets generally remain healthy (Appendix I). The fiscal deficit widened significantly in 2015 despite a sizable reduction in spending It increased to 15.9 percent of GDP from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 3, Tables 2 and 3). This was driven mainly by the drop in oil revenue (51 percent between 2014 and 2015). On the expenditure side, wage and other bonuses payments boosted spending in early 2015, but spending was curtailed significantly in the second half of the year (although some 2.5 percent of GDP of spending was deferred to 2016 by delaying the 13th month wage payment and some payments to contractors). The government financed the fiscal deficit through a rundown of its deposits and domestic borrowing. The external position has weakened The current account moved into a deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP in 2015 as the value of oil exports fell (Table 4, Figure 4). Financial outflows continued as banks and a large pension fund increased their foreign assets. SAMA’s NFA have fallen by $154 billion since December 2014. There has been some pressure on the riyal in the forward market, which has prompted the SAMA Governor to reiterate the authorities’ commitment to the peg and the central bank to ban local banks from selling option contracts on FX forwards. – Current account Financial account (including errors and omissions) Changes in reserves Current Account and Financial Account Balance (In percent of GDP) Sources: Country authorities; and IMF staff calculations. Page 11 Bank deposits have declined, but growth of credit to the private sector has remained strong (Table 5, Figure 5). Deposit growth declined by 2 percent (y/y) in April 2016 as households and businesses reduced their holdings of demand deposits, with deposits of government entities remaining broadly unchanged. Private sector credit grew by 10 percent, due in part to a surge in credit to the construction sector (27 percent (y/y) in 2016Q1), which was at least partly due to contractors accessing credit lines in the face of payment delays from the government. Over the past year, Banks have reduced holdings of SAMA bills, excess deposits at SAMA, and foreign assets to meet credit demand and to purchase government bonds, while SAMA also relaxed the loan-to-deposit ratio in February. SIBOR has moved substantially higher and the spread to U.S rates has widened. SAMA increased its reverse repo rate by 25bp to 0.5 percent in December. Major credit rating agencies have downgraded Saudi Arabia’s credit rating (Fitch (AA-), S&P (A-), and Moody’s (A1)). Job creation for Saudis was weak in 2015 (Figure 6). Total employment increased by 3.8 percent, while the employment of Saudis increased by only 1 percent and actually fell by over 1 percent in the private sector. The unemployment rate of nationals fell slightly to 11.5 percent, although female unemployment rose to 33.8 percent.
