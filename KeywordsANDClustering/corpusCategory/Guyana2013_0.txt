Guyana has experienced seven consecutive years of solid growth buoyed by agriculture and extractive industries . Still, its per capita GDP is the lowest in the English-speaking Caribbean and the debt burden, though low by Caribbean standards, remains elevated (Figure 1). The economy largely depends on the export of six commodities––sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice––which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. As a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s, Guyana became heavily indebted, recording a total public debt of 186 percent of GDP at HIPC completion point at end-2003. In March 2007, the IDB, Guyana's principal donor, canceled its debt of nearly US$470 million (21 percent of GDP), which along with other debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down to 65 percent by 2009. Nevertheless, the government is still servicing a sizable external debt burden, against the urgent need for expanded public investment to boost economic capacity and reduce poverty. Since the completion of the PRGF in 2006, the authorities’ policies have continued to be broadly in line with Fund advice. A number of first generation technical assistance projects undertaken with the Fund, including VAT implementation, public financial management and statistics have been useful to the authorities. These reforms have contributed to the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts that have helped to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In recent years the Fund has recommended further fiscal consolidation to help reduce the debt and rebuild policy buffers (Box 1). The authorities view the pace of their fiscal consolidation as consistent with their objective of reducing the country’s significant infrastructure deficit and addressing unmet social needs.
