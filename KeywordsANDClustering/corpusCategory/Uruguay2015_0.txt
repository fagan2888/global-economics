Uruguay has experienced more than a decade of high economic growth, and has become a bastion of stability in a volatile region . Since the financial crisis of 2002, living standards have greatly improved, with a per capita GDP that is among the highest in Latin America, while inequality and poverty are among the lowest. This success owes much to broadly shared societal support for social stability and inclusion, combined with a growth model that emphasized diversification into new markets and new products, thereby reducing regional linkages, while embracing the opportunities in agriculture, forestry, and tourism offered by the country’s natural resources. Over the last five years, growth has been higher than in neighboring countries and international financial markets have recognized Uruguay’s stability and strong financial buffers. Against a historically high correlation with growth in Argentina and Brazil, growth in Uruguay has remained relatively resilient since 2010. Uruguay has also distinguished itself through prudent debt management. Its relatively steady sovereign spreads are indicative of the ongoing differentiation by international investors between Uruguay and other countries in the region, in a context of increased volatility.
