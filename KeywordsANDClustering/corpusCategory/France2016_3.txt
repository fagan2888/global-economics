Fiscal consolidation is slowing and debt keeps rising. Structural fiscal adjustment, as measured by staff, fell from an annual average of 1 percent of GDP in 2011–13 to 0.3 percent in 2014–15, and is projected to be around zero in 2016−18. The slowdown reflects the effects of tax cuts and failure to curb real spending growth, which has been at the heart of France’s fiscal problems. The government’s consolidation strategy—relying heavily on broad-based nominal spending containment—has not delivered the hoped-for fiscal savings in the context of low growth and inflation.

Public debt continues to rise and is sensitive to growth shocks.

Despite very favorable financing conditions, France will just barely meet the EDP deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in 2017 without further efforts. Structural adjustment over 2015–18 is projected to average 0.1 percent of GDP, well below the EC’s recommendation. Without further efforts, France will not reach the structural balance objective within the five-year projection horizon. Debt is projected to peak at close to 98 percent of GDP in 2017, and decline only slowly thereafter. Fiscal dynamics could easily derail. The fiscal strategy faces two major risks: implementation shortfalls and growth shocks. The government has committed to a sharp reduction in real spending growth over the medium term—this would require substantial additional policy measures that are not yet fully specified. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to find offsets for new spending needs. To illustrate the implementation risks: if real structural primary spending was to continue growing at its current pace, the structural deficit would rise to 3.1 percent of GDP by 2021, against a baseline projection of 1.2 percent of GDP. Even if the necessary measures are taken, France’s Stability Program objectives could still be derailed by growth shocks. Staff has simulated two such shocks—a protracted stagnation for the euro area and a severe global recession with financial stress (see Appendix I). In both scenarios, staff would advocate letting automatic stabilizers work, but this would also mean that the 2017 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) objective will be missed, and that debt will climb to well above 100 percent of GDP (see Appendix II). Moreover, if the scale of the shock is such that coordinated fiscal action is pursued within the euro area, France may need to allow for additional loosening. While a coordinated response in such circumstances would prevent a sharper deterioration in near-term growth and debt dynamics (depending on the size of fiscal multipliers and intra euro area spillovers), it would further delay achieving the medium-term structural objectives, and could raise debt levels over the longer term as the stimulus is eventually withdrawn. Page 16 Fiscal Dynamics Could Derail Under Downside Scenarios (In percent of GDP / Potential GDP) Sources: French authorities and IMF Staff calculations. 1/ The scenarios are described in Appendix I. It is thus important to use the current economic upturn for rebuilding fiscal buffers, based on sustained efforts to slow spending growth. To anchor the needed fiscal consolidation, general government spending growth should be limited to the rate of inflation—as is broadly envisaged in the government’s latest Stability Program from 2017 onwards. This would imply an annual structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP—a moderate effort by both international and historical standards—striking a reasonable balance between anchoring fiscal sustainability and limiting the impact on demand. It would help reach the medium-term target of structural balance in four years. Despite the impact on aggregate demand, the proposed adjustment path would place public debt on a firmer downward trajectory, and eventually make room for lowering France’s still heavy tax burden. A set of near-term measures that limit the impact on growth by addressing structural inefficiencies, duplication, and poorly targeted spending, in line with the broader agenda of spending reforms (see below), could include: (i) slowing recruitment and limiting the wage drift; (ii) further tightening budget constraints for local governments (e.g., tightening of the caps on local Assuming a fiscal multiplier of 1, the headline deficit would fall to about ½ percent by 2021, with public spending and debt respectively 1.2 and 1.8 percent of GDP below the baseline. The adjustment would reduce on average growth by 0.3 percentage point per year through 2020, allowing for further tax reductions starting the same year, partly offsetting the loss in growth in previous years. See the 2015 Article IV staff report for a fuller discussion on the impact of spending containment on debt and fiscal adjustment.

Deep reforms to enhance spending efficiency will be critical to ensure sustainability. The recent experience highlights the limits of a spending containment approach to consolidation. Efficiency-oriented reforms would help underpin the needed adjustment and fiscal sustainability while limiting its impact on growth and protecting the French social model. Staff’s recently published study shows that such reforms could yield significant savings (Box 2). In particular: Streamlining the large civil service and limiting the wage drift at all levels of government would help reduce the wage bill, which at 13 percent of GDP is appreciably above the levels in EU peer countries. Increasing the targeting of social spending, for instance by expanding means-testing (notably for family and housing allowances), could yield significant savings without adversely affecting social outcomes. For illustration, if the redistributive efficiency of social benefits was at the EU average, France could achieve the same reduction in income inequality at a fiscal cost that is lower by 3.5 percentage points of GDP. While demographics and recent reforms make France’s pension liabilities more manageable than in some other EU countries, there is still room to further increase the effective retirement age and rationalize special regimes. Slowing the growth in the cost of public health care, which already amounts to 8 percent of GDP, could be helped by further enhancing use of generic medicines, rationalizing hospital services and costs, and strengthening cost effectiveness evaluations. Authorities’ views. The authorities underscored their commitment to a fiscal consolidation strategy that is fully based on expenditure efforts. They agreed that general government spending should be kept broadly flat in real terms, as the 2016 Stability Program stipulates for 2017–19. They acknowledged that structural fiscal adjustment is slowing, although less so than measured by staff, and that real spending is continuing to increase, while noting that the spending ratio partly reflects tax credits. They saw the slowdown in adjustment as necessary to preserve the economic recovery and noted that the public ratio would soon start declining. They agreed that strong spending control and additional measures will be required in 2017, but expressed confidence that the headline deficit would Jean-Jacques Hallaert and Maximilien Queyranne (2016) “From containment to rationalization: Increasing public expenditure efficiency,” IMF Working Paper 16/7. The results of this study were presented at a workshop organized by the Treasury in November 2015 and, during the mission, at a seminar organized by the Audit Court. According to the EC’s 2015 Ageing Report , the cost of public age-related spending will remain broadly at its current level until 2025, before declining by 2.8 percentage points of GDP by 2060, partly reflecting demographics and successive pension reforms. By comparison, public age-related spending cost is projected to decline by 0.2 percentage points on average in the EU by 2060, by 1.9 percentage points in Italy, and increase by 2.7 percentage points in Germany and 0.7 percentage point in the United Kingdom. The 2015 reform of supplementary pensions will further reduce incentives for early retirement, generating savings of 0.2−0.3 percent of GDP by 2060. Page 18 come in below 3 percent of GDP. They appreciated staff’s recently published study on expenditure efficiency in France, and reiterated their objective to gradually reduce France’s spending and tax ratios. To achieve this, they stressed that the approach of keeping tight budget constraints on all levels of government should help encourage spending units to seek efficiency gains. They also saw value in continuing the targeted annual spending reviews in selected areas initiated in 2015. Regarding euro area fiscal governance, they indicated support for simplifying the rules to increase their transparency and predictability.
