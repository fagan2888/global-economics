Senegal’s banking sector shares the vulnerabilities identified at the WAEMU level and financial depth remains limited (Chart 6). The financial system is relatively well capitalized. Apart from concentration risks, there do not seem to be significant risks to financial stability at this point. Senegal’s financial sector remains dominated by a few banks (four of them international), with a rapidly rising microfinance sector. As in the rest of WAEMU, asset quality is an issue, underscored by relatively high nonperforming loans, as well as high concentration risks. Staff encourages the authorities to liaise with the banking commission and WAEMU authorities in case potential stability risks occur. The authorities plan to take steps in this direction. Chart 6.

The relatively high level of NPLs (20 percent) is attributable to a few enterprises, one of which in the chemical sector has been recently recapitalized, with the new owner promising to repay its debt. The main risks in the financial sector could come from a failure to implement the reforms that would raise growth to levels envisaged in the PSE and achieved by comparator countries. The authorities have welcomed staff suggestions that they pick four to five of the comparator countries which could provide useful insight for Senegal and review the institutional Page 18 arrangements and policy actions they have taken to safeguard their financial sector. Based on this review, which should be completed during the course of 2015, actions which require collective decisions at the WAEMU level could be identified. The authorities are implementing a strategy to improve access to financing. In 2013, three financial institutions were established: the Fonds de Garantie des Investissements Prioritaires (FONGIP) aimed at lowering lending rates for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) by providing a system of mutual guarantee, the Fonds Souverain d’Investissements Stratégiques (FONSIS) for direct assistance to SMEs through the provision of funding and the Banque Nationale pour le Développement Economique (BNDE). All three institutions only have few months of activity as they are still establishing themselves in the financial system and seeking additional funding preferably at concessional terms. The authorities are also working to strengthen the banking system resilience, including the issue of NPLs. More specifically, the authorities are working on: (i) a strategy to improve financial information through the development of credit bureaus; (ii) increasing the role of collateral and reducing informational asymmetries; (iii) improving banking crisis resolution mechanisms in line with IMF recommendations at the WAEMU level, as potential costs coming from bank resolutions could translate into fiscal costs for Senegal. Staff welcomes this course of action and encourages the authorities to accelerate these reforms and work with regional authorities to strengthen banking system resilience.
