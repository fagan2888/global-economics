Moody's Ratings and Public Debt (Percent of GDP) Without fiscal buffers, public debt has steadily increased since launching the airport project and with the rehabilitation spending following three major natural disasters. Public debt rose from 57 percent of GDP at end- 2008 to 74 percent of GDP at end-2015— near the ECCU median—due to the global financial crisis and damages caused by natural disasters in 2010, 2011 and 2013. At end-2015, St. Vincent’s public debt was higher than the median public debt of other countries with Moody’s sovereign rating of B3 (excluding Barbados). Without remedial measures, the risk of public debt distress has risen to high, even when abstracting from natural disasters and their additional fiscal burden. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Sources: Moody's and WEO. St. Vincent and the Grenadines - B3 Median of B3 (excl BRB and VCT) Median of ECCU Barbados - B3 The authorities have made some progress towards consolidating the fiscal position since 2013, including by implementing past staff recommendation and lower capital outlays. The primary deficit of the central government, excluding grants, improved from 5 percent of GDP in 2013 to an estimated 1.1 percent of GDP in 2015, beyond staff expectations presented in the 2014 staff report. This was achieved despite a decrease of tax revenue of ⅓ pp of GDP between 2014 and 2015, partly due to one-off income tax collections in 2014. The improved fiscal position reflected largely a sharp compression of investment outlays owing to delays in completing the airport and post-floods rehabilitation. Capital spending was executed at ⅓ of its budgeted figure for 2015, including due to shortfalls in project grants, and capacity and financing constraints.

Implementation of some of the past staff recommendations also helped. This includes containing the wage bill through a hiring freeze and restraining the growth in wages below that of nominal GDP—despite the wage increase of 2½ percent in 2015, restraining transfers and subsidies, and mobilizing additional revenue by raising the customs service charge on imports while expanding the legal capacity of revenue administration. However, staff recommendations on increasing information sharing between the Inland Revenue Sources: St. Vincent National Authorities; and IMF Staff Calculations.
