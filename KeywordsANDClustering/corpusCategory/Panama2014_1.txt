Growth is expected to remain healthy . Real GDP growth is expected to moderate (as difficulties in the ZLC are expected to continue and public investment starts its normalization), but to remain healthy at above 7 percent in 2014 owing to robust private investment. Growth should gradually converge to its medium-term potential of about 6 percent, as capital spending unwinds and fiscal consolidation continues along the SFRL path. Output gap (percent) Inflation (eop, percent) 2013p The economy shows some signs of overheating . The combination of strong domestic demand, robust credit growth, negative structural primary balance, positive output gap, tight labor market, an appreciating real exchange rate (reflecting persistently higher inflation than that of major trading partners), and a large current account deficit points to the risk of overheating and loss in competitiveness. Buoyant domestic conditions have been a contributing factor in driving inflation since Sources: Panama National Authorities; and IMF staff calculations. Chart 6.

Page 9 mid-2000s, in addition to external factors (food and gasoline prices). Indeed, the typical positive relation between inflation and the economic cycle seems quite evident since mid-2000s—when growth and investment rose substantially—after having been dormant for more than a decade (see Chart 5, Chart 6, and Box 2). There are risks that inflation may become entrenched in wage dynamics (especially in light of recent increases in minimum wages and public teachers’ remuneration).

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. Panama’s extensive external linkages bring strong economic and financial benefits, but also make the country vulnerable to shifts in global economic and financial conditions (see Figure 5, Chart 7, Box 3, and Box 4). The normalization of U. S. monetary policy, and the uncertainty regarding its pace, may expose vulnerabilities, including through Chart 7. Panama: Growth Rates (Annual percentage change) Panama World trade China United States (right axis) Staff’s analysis indicates that negative external real and financial shocks could have a significant impact on output growth (see “Spillovers to Panama: Impact of Trade and International Financial Shocks”, Country Report No. 13/89). 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Source : World Economic Outlook. Page 10 rising interest rates and capital outflows. The authorities consider such risks manageable, especially if the process happens gradually, mainly because public debt maturity is long (about 11 years for total debt and 13 years for external debt), and domestic bank rates are not very responsive to U.S. interest rates (see Box 5).They also indicated that an increase in interest rates would contribute to taming the risks of overheating. A protracted economic slowdown in trading partners would significantly affect Panama’s exports, particularly Canal revenues. Persistent political and economic tensions in Venezuela would continue to have a negative effect on the ZLC, but may also induce capital inflows. Overall, strong fundamentals and the ability to implement countercyclical fiscal policies would mitigate the impact of possible external shocks.

Panama Canal Traffic, Revenue and Transfers 1/ Public debt is deemed sustainable even in the presence of significant shocks Assuming that over the next few years the fiscal deficit path matches the declining SFRL ceilings path and that economic growth converges towards its potential, public debt is projected to decline to about 32 percent of GDP in the medium term (see Table 7 and Annex II). Additional relaxations of the SFRL ceilings would erode the credibility of the SFRL framework and investors’ confidence. Starting in 2015, the amount of Canal transfers that can be used for current period fiscal expenditure will be capped at 3.5 percent of GDP, with the Sovereign Wealth Fund ( Fondo de Ahorro de Panama , FAP) absorbing any excess in total Canal transfers. The government will be able to use FAP’s assets to run countercyclical fiscal policy in the event of economic downturns or natural disasters, and to reduce debt. Canal transfers generally comprise a large portion of nontax Sources: Panama National Authorities; and IMF staff calculations. 1/ The coefficient of variation of canal revenue as % of GDP is 0.11. Panama has large gross external positions (see Tables 4 and 10), and the banking sector plays a regional banking hub role (Figure 5). International funding risks can be significant in case of potential deleveraging in Europe, due mainly to Panama’s large exposures—particularly of nonbank entities—to European banks (Box 3). Panama Canal traffic reflects about 5 percent of world trade. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) also indicates that debt would remain sustainable in the occurrence of a simultaneous interest rate and growth shock similar to the one occurred in 2008 – 09, but more persistent. Should a temporary shock similar to the 2008 – 09 be coupled with a banking crisis that required fiscal intervention of about 17 percent of GDP, debt will obviously rise, but still remain sustainable. Law 38 2012 instituted the FAP and endowed it with the assets of the Fondo Fiduciario (about US$1.3bn). The newly appointed board and management aim to align the asset allocation to the objectives of FAP. Funds can be transferred to the National Treasury under the following conditions: (i) if a state of emergency is declared by the Cabinet, FAP can be called to cover the associated cost exceeding 0.5 percent of GDP as long as FAP assets are above 2 percent of GDP; (ii) in the occurrence of an economic slowdown (from 2015 onwards), defined as growth less than 2 percent for two consecutive quarters, FAP can be asked to contribute as long as FAP assets are above 2 percent of GDP; (iii) the government may decide to use FAP assets to repay sovereign debt for up to 0.5 percent of GDP per (continued) Page 11 revenue, historically have been fairly stable (see Chart 8), and are expected to increase significantly in 2016. The Canal expansion presents some downside risks in the short term and upside risks in the medium term. In December 2013, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) and the Grupo Unidos por el Canal (GUPC)—the consortium handling a US$3.2 billion contract in the Canal expansion— entered into a dispute, over a cost overrun of US$1.6 billion claimed by GUPC. As a consequence, the expansion activity slowed down and then halted completely for two weeks in February 2014. An agreement was reached in late February 2014, and the project completion is now expected by end-2015. Should additional tensions arise, the ACP is confident that work can be completed with small additional delays and costs. Once the expansion is finished, Canal traffic should increase significantly due to the transit of larger (New-Panamax) ships, and in particular the transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas. Over the long term, the possible construction of a canal in Nicaragua could increase competition for ACP.
