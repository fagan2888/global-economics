Export diversification and upward shifts in the value-added chain are key items in the authorities’ reform agenda. Nascent export lines (leather, apparel, textile, flowers, electricity) and expansion to new markets point to good prospects, supported by substantial cost differentials. However, export revenue still depends heavily on commodities, hindering income growth and amplifying volatility. Ongoing policy initiatives aim at developing additional export lines with a focus on manufacturing and export-processing activities, notably with the creation of new industrial parks. These provide investors with simplified procedures, tax advantages, and preferential access to credit and foreign exchange. Eventually, however, the industrial park environment will need to be integrated more fully into the local value chain to generate all its potential of positive spillovers into the wider economy. Also, progress in reducing trade barriers and enhancing the customs’ trade facilitation role beyond industrial parks would increase competitiveness. The authorities are also launching other regulatory and administrative reforms aiming at improving the investment environment (Figure 5). Source: Doing Business, World Bank.

Staff assess the birr to be overvalued by 20 to 40 percent (Annex III). Allowing for a more flexible exchange rate determination, aiming to gradually eliminate misalignments, would bring the real effective exchange rate in consonance with fundamentals and reduce foreign exchange market shortages. Also, a more flexible exchange rate policy could be instrumental in developing new export lines and entering new markets (Box 2, Figure 6). Staff research on Ethiopia’s export dynamics, based on product-by-product disaggregated data, indicates that the (country-by-country) real exchange rate plays a crucial role in entering new markets—although significantly less so in increasing revenue from already established markets, which are mainly traditional commodities. As a consequence, the real appreciation of the Birr can pose an impediment to the emergence of a competitive manufacturing Page 21 exporting sector—and more generally to the export of non-commodity products with high domestic value-added facing price competition. Thus, exchange rate policies aiming to eliminate currency misalignments could play an instrumental role in achieving the authorities’ export diversification objectives. Higher import costs for the public (and private) sector would partly have a desirable dampening effect on imports’ demand—in line with a policy to reduce external imbalances—and partly would need to be absorbed through savings in other items; and in the longer term would be compensated by growth effects. Higher foreign reserves would enhance the resilience of the economy (Annex II). Ethiopia remains vulnerable to commodity price and weather shocks. Reducing the current account deficit and expanding foreign reserve cover – aiming to eventually reach the standard of 5–7 months of imports - would forestall potentially disorderly import compression in the event of future shocks. The new policy agenda for public enterprises aims at streamlining the sector, improving its governance and efficiency, and raising its profitability. The centralization of public enterprise management under a newly created ministry with this mandate is a valuable first step in this direction. The authorities are encouraged to implement expeditiously their plans to focus on 10–15 key public enterprises while privatizing the rest, strengthen their financial disclosure and transparency, and manage them on a commercial basis. Authorities’ views The authorities agreed with staff’s emphasis on competiveness-enhancing reforms. They had launched initiatives to improve the business climate and facilitate exports—including logistics infrastructure provision. The authorities expressed concerns regarding the potential adverse impact on inflation and public sector costs from a more flexible exchange rate system. The authorities view the potential overvaluation of the birr substantially lower than staff’s estimates. Over the next few years, the NBE plans to increase its reserve import cover target to three months (national definition, about 2½ months in standard definition). Page 22 Box 2. Ethiopia: Export Dynamics and Diversification Over the past 15 years Ethiopia’s merchandise export revenue grew at 13.3 percent on average This strong performance stems from volume expansion (15.1 percent annually), as prices decreased by 2.3 percent annually. However, export growth—both price and volume—remains highly volatile, due to concentration on agricultural commodities exposed to price and weather shocks. To reduce export volatility and increase revenue, policies aim at diversification across products and destination countries . Also, diversification has development spillovers, as less innovative firms follow in the wake of pioneer entrants. As a result, one third of 2015 export revenue comes from markets where Ethiopia was not present 15 years ago. FDI has flowed to horticulture and light manufacturing, and non- traditional exports account for more than 10 percent of total exports. For example, flower exports expanded from US$440,000 and 5 destinations in 2004 to US$225 million and 59 destinations now. Staff analyses, based on disaggregated trade data (UN Comtrade), throw some light on the relative impact on export sales of two competitiveness factors structural competitiveness, as measured by five indices from the Doing Business indicator, and the real exchange rate (RER). These factors are measured by market-specific trade-weighted indices of Ethiopia’s strength versus competitors.

Notes: ** = significant at 1 pct level; dI y denotes the change of index I y. The results (see table) indicate that the relative quality of logistics is key in improving export performance; and that the RER significantly facilitates entry in new markets—such as the above- mentioned case of flower exports . In markets where the “time it takes to export” index moved against Ethiopia (relative to competitors), exports fell significantly (first column). Similarly, the quality of Ethiopia vs. competitors’ trade logistics influences the probability of Ethiopia’s entry into new markets (third column). The RER seemingly matters little when it comes to expanding exports in existing markets (mostly commodities), but it is significant for entry into new markets (third column). Therefore, ongoing improvements in infrastructure, such as the new railway link to Djibouti harbor, are likely to boost exports. But also, Ethiopia could gain a foothold in new products and markets by reducing the substantial real exchange rate misalignment.
