Angola is a post-conflict country—decades of hostilities ended in 2002—with significant infrastructure and human capital deficits . Oil receipts underpinned strong growth in the last decade, but have also made the country vulnerable to oil revenue volatility. Progress was made in reducing poverty rates from 54 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2008. However, inequality has increased. Following elections in 2012, the government has embarked on a National Development Plan (NDP) that puts priority on a large expansion of infrastructure spending to support economic diversification and inclusive growth. However, spending is well below that stipulated in the NDP.
