The new federal government’s economic program is closely aligned to past Fund recommendation (Appendix III). Article IV discussions took place during general strikes called by the unions against the government program. However, disagreements between the unions and the federal government were fundamentally about how to distribute the burden of adjustment across generations and taxpayers, rather than about the need for reform. All stakeholders recognized the importance of increasing the duration of working life, strengthening competitiveness, and repairing public finances. The previous government had already implemented a program of wage moderation and reform of social transfers to address these challenges. The new government’s stance is that a more ambitious approach is necessary to improve growth and employment prospects and secure fiscal sustainability.
