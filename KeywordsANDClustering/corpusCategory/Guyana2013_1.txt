Macroeconomic developments in 2012 were driven by high commodity prices, foreign direct investment, and domestic credit expansion to the private sector. Real sector and prices. Real GDP is projected to grow by around 4.8 percent this year, the same as the outturn in 2012 (Table 1 and Figure 2). This would reflect strength in agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, engineering and construction, and services. Inflation is Further debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives, as well as the effects of rebasing the GDP series, brought the debt to about 65 percent of GDP in 2009. Agriculture Mining and Quarrying Services Others Real GDP growth Sectoral Contribution to Real GDP Growth (percent) Page 6 projected to remain low at around 3.5 percent by year-end, following subdued price increase through August 2013, notwithstanding higher import costs and seasonal rise in food prices. External sector. In the first half of 2013, the current account deficit widened to 9.3 percent of GDP compared with 8.4 percent of GDP in same period last year. Over the rest of the year, the current account deficit is expected to widen to 16.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from 13.3 percent in 2012, driven by a larger trade deficit due to higher fuel imports, lower commodity exports (mainly on account of falling gold prices, a main export), and lower remittances, which are projected to fall with slowing activity in major host countries (Table 2 and Figure 3). The financial account surplus is projected to increase with larger disbursements related to an ambitious public investment program and resilient FDI despite current political uncertainties and delays in the Amaila Falls Hydroelectric Project (AFHP). These developments will result in an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP, but gross international reserves are projected to remain adequate at 3.6 months of imports compared to 4.2 months in 2012. Fiscal Sector. In FY2012 the authorities achieved an overall fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the 2011 deficit (Tables 3a, 3b and 3c and Figure 4). While growing strongly in nominal terms (7 percent), central government revenues net of grants declined by 0.8 percent of GDP, reflecting lower intake of income and consumption taxes. Non-interest current expenditures rose by 1 percent of GDP on a rise in transfer payments to electricity and sugar companies, partly offset by a decline in spending on other goods and services. Capital expenditures rose by 0.2 percent of GDP due to the advancement of several key Lower consumption tax revenues are related to VAT refunds, while income tax shortfalls reflect the lowering of corporate income tax rates and an increase in the non-taxable threshold for personal income tax. The lowering of the corporate tax-rate is an effort to improve competitiveness and the increase in the personal income threshold is aimed at poverty reduction. 2009201020112012201320142015201620172018WEO oil price, % change (right)Current account incl. off. transfers, % of GDPTerms of trade, % change Guyana Tourism-dependent Caribbean 2/ Commodity-exporting Caribbean 3/ Public Sector Balance 1/ 1/Caribbean region measured as simple averages of corresponding variables.2/Tourism-dependent Caribbean includes Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis,St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.3/ Commodity-exporting Caribbean includes Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. Page 7 development projects. Aided by subventions, public enterprises returned a surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP compared to a deficit of 0.6 percent a year ago. Financial Sector. The overall banking system appears well-capitalized, profitable and liquid (Figure 5). All banks report capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirement. NPLs have remained between 5 and 6 percent over the last three years and provisioning for bad loans stands at comfortable levels. Monetary policy. Monetary policy has been accommodative, but monetary conditions appear to have tightened somewhat in the first 5 months of 2013 (Table 4 and Figure 6). After accelerating to about 13 percent in 2012, twelve-month broad money growth has moderated to about 9 percent as of May 2013. Private credit growth remained high at 15.3 percent on an annual basis in May, following three years of credit growth close to 20 percent. Liquidity in the banking system remained at high levels with the ratio of liquid to total assets at 32.4 percent as of June. As a result, the benchmark 91-day T-bill rate, already negative in real terms for some years, continued to decline to 1.2 percent as of July. Lower interest rates, however, were not fully passed on by banks to lending rates, resulting in widening net interest margins. Exchange rate policy. While the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, it has appreciated sharply and the external current account deficit has widened. The real effective exchange rate appreciated about 20 percent since 2008. This real appreciation occurred despite depreciation relative to the US dollar and reflects developments in the value of the US dollar (which the Guyanese dollar follows closely) against the euro and other major currencies, as well as higher inflation in Guyana relative to major trading partners. Noteworthy, the pace of depreciation relative to the US dollar has moderated sharply more recently, notwithstanding the deficit in the balance of payments and loss of international reserves. At the same time, adequate international reserves (Box 2) have provided a cushion to intervene in the foreign exchange market to smooth out exchange rate and price volatility. To avoid excessive volatility in the exchange rate, the Bank of Guyana intervened in the foreign exchange market in Financial Soundness Indicators, 2009-13 (In percent)20092010201120122013Q12013Q2Capital to risk-adjusted assets18.318.919.119.320.820.1NPLs to total loans8.36.55.48.45.75.4Provision for loan loss to NPLs53.863.279.551.879.379.1Return on assets2.72.52.62.42.42.7Return on equity26.624.024.823.122.524.4Liquid assets to total assets30.930.031.131.528.432.4Related party loans to total loans4.54.02.93.73.93.7Top 20 borrowers to total loans35.523.116.917.117.217.4Source: Bank of Guyana.
