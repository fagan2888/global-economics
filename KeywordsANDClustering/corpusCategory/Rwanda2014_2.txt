MEFP 9 Compliance with the end-June quantitative criteria (QACs) was strong. All end-June QACs and all but one indicative target were met (MEFP Table 1). The floor on domestic revenue collection was missed by a small margin (less than 2 percent of revenue). Page 8 Of the seven structural benchmarks scheduled for end-June, six were met (MEFP Table 2). The only benchmark that was not met was the publication of the second quarter fiscal report on the MINECOFIN website, published with a delay (in September) because of a changeover in the BNR’s IT system, which delayed the availability of data related to government deposits and domestic borrowing. The end-September benchmark (review of local governments’ block grant formula) was also met.
