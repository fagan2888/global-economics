So far, spillovers have been mixed: mild from tapering and severe from the dimmer global copper outlook Though not immune, Chile has been remarkably resilient to the tapering- spillovers (Figure 2). The corporate sector has maintained access to external funding, capital inflows have remained buoyant, albeit with recent moderation, and the effect on EMBI spreads has been modest. Notably, Chile’s local currency long-term government bond yields have declined , reflecting policy credibility, monetary policy expectations, and low foreign participation. In contrast, the worsening global copper outlook has taken a toll on investment and growth and the effect seems bigger in Chile than in other copper exporters (Annex II). The peso has depreciated by 17 percent against the dollar since April 2013—amid monetary easing—and 11 percent in real effective terms.

Latest WEO April 2013 A Dimmer Outlook for Copper (US cents per pound) Sources: World Economic Outlook (WEO) and Fund staff estimates. Page 6 Activity has slowed markedly (Figure 3) . The growth moderation that started in 2012 became more pronounced in 2013 as private investment ground to a halt late in the year. The anticipated completion of large projects launched in previous years coincided with postponement of new projects. The first quarter of 2014 saw some recovery in activity and private investment, but durable goods consumption contracted on the back of a softer, if still quite tight, labor market. Net exports are providing an important offset. Although the slowdown has been sharp, much of it reflects an adjustment toward trend after a period of strong growth, and staff estimates a modest negative output gap. The central bank has eased monetary policy In October 2013, with inflation below target and a weakening economic outlook, the central bank bucked the tightening trend among emerging markets and cut the policy rate from 5 to 4 percent by April 2014 (Figure 4). The cuts transmitted quickly to interbank and lending rates, and added to peso depreciation. Nonetheless, credit growth has moderated for all types of credit, except for mortgages, which remain brisk. Inflation has picked up The pass through from peso depreciation to consumer prices has been surprisingly swift. Inflation was 4.3 percent (y/y) in April, up from 1.7 percent in October 2013. More worrisome, although the largest spike was in tradable goods inflation, as would be expected, non-tradable and core inflation measures have also risen. Still, inflation expectations remain anchored at 3 percent over the two-year policy horizon.

Page 7 Fiscal policy has stayed broadly neutral (Figure 5) The structural deficit in 2013 was 0.8 percent of GDP (staff estimate), roughly unchanged from 2012 net of a one-off capital gains tax windfall (equal to 0.4 percent of GDP). The fiscal stance, measured by staff as the change in the non- mining primary structural balance, was broadly neutral. The fall in copper revenue shifted the headline balance to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP from a surplus of equal size in 2012, but central government net assets remained at 6.7 percent of GDP helped by valuation gains. External imbalances have declined Real depreciation and weaker domestic demand kept the current account deficit at 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013 (a year ago, staff had projected a widening to 4.7 percent of GDP) and shrunk it in the first quarter of 2014 to 3.1 percent of GDP (annual basis). Foreign direct investment has declined but remains the main source of financing, albeit with a growing debt component. According to the Fund’s EBA estimates, the peso is in line with fundamentals, and this view is supported by a broader set of indicators—brisk (copper and non-copper) export volume growth, adequate reserves, and strong international investment position (Figure 6). That said, external debt has increased and gross external financing needs, though smaller than in 2013, remain sizeable at 17 percent of GDP, roughly half of which is non-bank corporate debt. Financial stability risks are contained Bank capitalization appears adequate, profitability remains comfortable, and nonperforming loans are low and fully provisioned. Domestic deposits are the main funding source, and reliance on foreign financing (excluding capital) is low, at 8.5 percent of total liabilities. In the important life insurance sector, profitability appears healthy, with returns on equity above the OECD median. Chilean insurance companies conservatively tend to accumulate more capital than required by regulations and solvency requirements are being strengthened. In recent years, the sector has expanded into lower-liquidity, higher-risk investments (e.g., real estate). As for corporates in the context of easy global financial conditions, firms have increased their indebtedness to about 92 percent of GDP, surpassing pre- crisis levels, though most of the increase reflects FDI-related debt with likely less roll-over risk (Annex III). Real estate remains dynamic Real mortgage credit expanded by 9 percent (y/y) in April, and house prices, following some deceleration, are rising again though with large regional variation (Figure 8). However, household indebtedness (mostly bank-financed) has remained broadly stable at about 55 percent of disposable income. Commercial real estate data are spottier, but an apparent oversupply of office space poses some risk to life insurers.
