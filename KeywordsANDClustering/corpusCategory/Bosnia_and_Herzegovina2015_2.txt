Employment While key macro-economic indicators have been improving, BiH still substantially lags its peers in income convergence to more advanced European economies. Per capita incomes average only about a quarter of the average EU income level. In addition, unemployment is stuck at a very high level—28 percent—and high youth and long-term unemployment are particularly worrisome. Unemployment rates appear relatively unresponsive to changes in economic growth, suggesting a large structural component in unemployment.
