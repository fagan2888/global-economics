Growth is expected to pick up slightly in the near term. Real GDP growth in 2016 is expected to reach 0.5 percent in Curaçao and 0.7 percent in Sint Maarten. For Curaçao, economic activity is projected to accelerate reflecting continued economic recovery in their main trading partners (especially the U.S.) and a continuation of both private and public investment projects (e.g. the hospital construction). Higher growth in Sint Maarten reflects expectations for higher private spending, particularly in the tourism and transportation sectors, and a moderate increase of tourism flows. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to accelerate gradually to 0.8 percent in Curaçao and 1 percent in Sint Maarten, as the effect of lower oil prices is countered by an increase in prices in the U.S. and the Netherlands, the Union’s main trading partners. Medium-term prospects remain broadly positive but will depend on the authorities’ efforts to address structural bottlenecks. Over the medium term, growth is expected to moderately pick up to 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, respectively. The expansion in both countries will mainly depend on the timely implementation of structural reforms aimed at attracting more FDI, relaxing restrictions on hiring foreign labor, and reducing costs of doing business (¶18-21). On the external side, the Union’s current account deficit is projected to gradually improve over the medium term. The deficit is expected to narrow in 2016, reflecting projections for lower oil prices and higher tourism receipts, notwithstanding higher imports of construction material related to public investment projects (particularly the construction of a new hospital in Curaçao). Given adequate external financing, including from foreign direct investments, debt issues, and a decrease in foreign assets, the Union’s net international reserves are projected to increase in 2016. Going forward, the Union’s external imbalances are expected to gradually decline as tourism demand picks up. Nevertheless, given the reliance on a narrow scope of products and markets, considerable risks remain, underscoring the need to improve competitiveness, reduce vulnerabilities Y Y ç CC bb ç cc cc Page 17 to external shocks, and build external buffers to ensure external sustainability going forward. Staff estimates, which are based on limited data and subject to considerable uncertainty, suggest that Curaçao’s REER is somewhat undervalued, while that of Sint Maarten is somewhat overvalued (Annex II). On current policies, Curaçao’s fiscal position is expected to gradually improve, but public debt will continue to build up. The primary deficit is projected to narrow to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2016, and will further decline to 0.8 percent of GDP over the medium term, as the hospital construction gradually winds down. The tax-to- GDP-ratio is projected to decrease moderately as another round of profit tax rate cut (from 25 percent to 22 percent) became effective in 2016, with revenue losses expected to be only partially offset by reduced deductions and strengthened compliance. The government’s current account balance (after accounting for the consumption of fixed capital, i.e. depreciation), is just above zero in 2016. Close expenditure management and strict budget execution will be needed to ensure compliance with the fiscal rules (¶26). Sint Maarten’s fiscal position is expected to improve, with higher revenue mobilization. The primary deficit is expected to decline slightly to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2016, from 0.6 percent in 2015. The tax -to-GDP ratio is expected to increase to 20.5 percent in 2016, from 20.3 percent in 2015, based on stronger tax collection (including on casino tax). Other revenues are also expected to increase in 2016, with the projected receipt of dividends from the central bank. The debt-to-GDP ratio will increase marginally to 36.7 percent of GDP at end 2016, relative to 36.5 percent at end 2015. Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to the downside (Annex I). Continued low growth in the euro area could negatively affect Curaçao and Sint Maarten through trade, tourism, remittances, and investment channels. Persistent strengthening in the U.S. dollar could lead to further appreciation of the REER, and a loss in competitiveness vis-à-vis European and Canadian The profit tax (levied on corporate income) rate has been reduced from 34.5 percent to 27.5 percent in 2012, and then from 27.5 percent to 25 percent in 2015. nu nu ç 2015201620172018201920202021Total revenue23.123.923.623.723.823.823.8Tax revenue20.320.520.420.520.520.520.5Total expenditure24.424.724.624.624.624.524.5Overall balance-1.3-0.8-1.0-0.8-0.7-0.7-0.7Primary balance-0.6-0.1-0.3-0.2-0.2-0.2-0.2Pubilc Debt36.536.736.736.335.735.034.3Sources: Central Bank; and IMF Staff Estimates.

Reduced financial services by global/regional banks could result in disruptions to banking services, hindering cross-border financial transactions. Given the close trade relationship, Curaçao remains vulnerable to a further disruption of economic activity in Venezuela (Annex IV). Other downside risks include slow implementation of planned structural reforms, an outbreak of Zika, and a natural disaster in Sint Maarten. Upside risks include improving economic prospects in the U.S. generating tourism for Sint Maarten, higher investment flows through major tourism projects, and spillover and productivity gains through higher public investment if managed prudently. With the current low levels and favorable public and external debt dynamics for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) finds the risk of debt distress low, but the debt paths are sensitive to shocks (Annex III). In Curaçao, while public debt is already on an upward trend, a combined macro-fiscal shock could add another 10 percentage points to its debt-to-GDP ratio. Besides, under a full-blown Venezuela shock scenario (where all trade links between the two countries are removed and the refinery business comes to a complete stop in 2019), Curaçao’s debt-to-GDP ratio could end up 7½ percentage points above the baseline by 2021. In Sint Maarten, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by 10 percentage points under a hurricane scenario (assuming a 10 percent of GDP increase in government expenditure in 2017 to cover post-disaster reconstruction needs). Both island’s significant vulnerability to shocks calls for the authorities’ sustained efforts on reforms to strengthen their fiscal frameworks, build policy buffers, improve external competitiveness, and unlock growth potential.
