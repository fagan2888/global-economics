Kenya is poised to reap the rewards of extensive institutional reforms and prudent macroeconomic policy in a market-friendly environment. A surge in public investment in infrastructure; renewed interest of foreign investors in domestic and regional opportunities using Nairobi as a hub; and lower transaction costs helped by improvements in information technology, are expected to lift economic activity. Convergence of interbank rates toward the central bank policy rate, and stability of the market-determined exchange rate reflect a positive impact of macroeconomic policies on credibility and expectations. The successful debut Eurobond issuance suggests a promising outlook for Kenya to further integrate to global financial markets and reach over time emerging market status. Long-term financing opportunities to the private sector are opening up in the form of project financing and private equity investment, including for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Kenya is already taking steps to adapt its policies to rising middle-income-country type challenges. Kenya’s external buffers and the fiscal plans outlined in the Budget Policy Statement are consistent with meeting the EAMU convergence criteria by 2021. Kenya’s foreign reserves, which have continued to increase despite the large current account deficit, appear broadly adequate. In the immediate horizon, fiscal space should be used to improve security conditions, still complicated by terrorist threats. In addition, devolution needs to be managed carefully to overcome transitional problems. In the medium term, decisive action in containing the wage bill and widening the tax base would further increase the room for much needed priority social and infrastructure spending.
