With the labor force expected to peak within the next 10 years, there is a need to ensure that dependency burdens remain in check. The proposed Low-income Working Family Allowance is a useful mechanism to incentivize labor force participation while providing supplementary income to employed individuals and families with incomes and assets under a certain threshold. The minimum wage, introduced in 2011 and raised twice since then (latest in May 2015), has placed a floor under hourly wages while also helping to raise participation among segments more distanced from the mainstream labor force. Labor force participation at the lower end of the income and skills distribution will be further incentivized by regulating working hours and mandating over-time pay for low-income workers with minimal bargaining power. Sustained efforts should therefore be made to move forward with legislation on standardizing working hours. Authoritiesâ€™ views. The authorities viewed the minimum wage as an important policy tool for alleviating working poverty. They also regarded it as helping to bring into employment those who might otherwise be discouraged by the very low wages on offer and not have participated in the labor force. Increases in employment for female workers have been particularly significant, especially those aged 50 and above and those in the lower-skilled segment. Income growth in the lowest decile has substantially outpaced that in other segments ever since the minimum wage was introduced. Together with the Low-Income Working Family Allowance, a major employment-focused initiative to encourage self-reliance and ease intergenerational poverty that will take effect from 2016, investment in retraining and retooling early retirees, and means-tested work transport subsidy, they saw these policies as important levers for encouraging labor force participation as well as for mitigating the impact of an aging population and shrinking labor force in the near future.
