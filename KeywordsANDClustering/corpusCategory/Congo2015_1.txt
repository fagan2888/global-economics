Growth rose to 6.8 percent in 2014, up from 3.3 percent the previous year, driven by a rebound in oil production, and continued strong performance of the non-oil sector. Non-oil growth was buoyed by strong growth in agriculture, construction, industry, and transport and communication. Inflation decelerated from 2.1 percent at end–2013 to 0.5 percent at end- 2014 (year-on-year), driven mainly by lower global food prices. Nevertheless, the Republic of Congo has been hit hard by the oil price shock. The sharp increase in government spending in recent years has supported growth, but it also increased the country’s vulnerability to shocks. Fiscal and current account balances deteriorated in 2014, reflecting increased government spending and the lower oil price. The overall fiscal deficit amounted to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2014, a near doubling from 2013. This reflects continued strong capital spending and lower oil receipts. Despite a 3 percent increase in production, oil receipts declined by 5 percent of GDP in line with oil prices and revisions to various profit sharing arrangements in July 2014. The basic non-oil primary deficit improved from over 74 percent to 72.1 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014. This measure excludes oil receipts, grants, and foreign-financed capital spending. The improvement was due to lower off-budget spending and payments of domestic arrears: Current expenditures were broadly in line with budgeted amounts, rising by 2.5 percent of non-oil GDP compared to 2013. Domestically-financed on-budget capital spending increased by 2.7 percent of non-oil GDP as construction for the 2015 AAG and the urbanization program continued. Non-oil revenues underperformed, falling by 0.5 percent of non-oil GDP compared to 2013, largely owing to lower than expected customs revenues. Page 11 Off-budget expenditures decreased by 3.2 percent of non-oil GDP. Domestic arrears payments amounted to 1.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014, down by 4.9 percent of non-oil GDP from 2013. Foreign-financed capital expenditures, which is not part of the basic non-oil primary balance, decreased by 7.1 percentage points of non-oil GDP to 11.6 percent of non-oil GDP as only about half of the budgeted amount was executed. In the wake of the decline in oil prices, the government repatriated offshore deposits to finance the fiscal deficit and to bolster official reserves. The fiscal deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP was mainly financed by drawing on government deposits held abroad (2.1 percent of GDP) and by borrowing from the regional central bank (about 5.2 percent of GDP). The current account deficit widened by one percent of GDP to 5½ percent of GDP in 2014. However, official reserves held at the BEAC increased by Sources: WEO database and IMF staff estimates. CFAF 189 billion to CFAF 2,698 billion at end-2014, thanks to the repatriation of government deposits held in China (CFAF 141 billion) and commercial banks’ deposits held abroad (CFA 427 billion, see ¶11). As a consequence, the Republic of Congo’s international reserves and government deposits at the regional central bank remain at about 9½ months of prospective imports and 20 percent of GDP, respectively, both the highest among members of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The authorities chose to borrow from the central bank ( avances statutaires ) in order to preserve their deposits at the BEAC which are mostly held in the Fund for Future Generations and for which penalties are incurred in the event of unscheduled drawings. In addition to their international reserves at the BEAC, the Republic of Congo’s holds offshore deposits in China. These deposits are partly held to provide guarantees for long-term concessional infrastructure loans that make up the bulk of Congo’s external debt.

The 2015 budget is based on an oil price assumption of $70 per barrel and implies some consolidation. However, in the first quarter Congo received less than $50 per barrel from its oil exports. In response, only 30 percent of monthly budget allocations for current expenditures were released, except for the wage bill and the salary component of transfers which were executed in full. At the same time, the implementation of lower-priority projects was slowed. In late-May, the Council of Ministers adopted a supplementary budget based on an oil price of $55. Parliamentary approval is pending. BEAC measures caused commercial banks’ net foreign assets (NFA) to decline. The trend increase in banks’ NFA observed in recent years reversed in 2014 when the BEAC moved in May and July 2014, facilitating and instructing banks to henceforth conduct foreign exchange transactions directly with the regional central bank rather than building foreign exchange balances abroad. As a result, banks reduced their NFA by CFAF 427 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) during 2014, to CFAF 165.5 billion at end–2014. Despite rising credit growth, financial depth continues to lag peers. The growth of credit to the economy accelerated to 27.6 percent in 2014, from 16½ percent in 2013. Notwithstanding the recent acceleration of credit growth, the ratio of private credit to GDP remains at 15 percent of GDP, well below the level in emerging market economies. Public debt now amounts to about 36½ percent of GDP, up from 32 percent of GDP in 2013 and from 20 percent of GDP in 2010, following the HIPC Completion Point. The increase in the government’s gross debt to GDP ratio in 2014 reflects continued borrowing, the terms of trade loss from the sharp decline in oil prices (which reduced nominal GDP growth), as well as valuation changes from the depreciation of the CFAF. Two of three ratings agencies maintained Congo’s strong sovereign rating. S&P’s downgraded C ngo’s rating from B+ to B, as part of a reassessment for all oil exporting countries. Empirical approaches commonly used in the case of oil-exporting countries suggest that Congo’s real effective exchange rate is in line with medium-term fundamentals, but competitiveness concerns remain in the non-oil economy (Annex 2). The persistent large non-oil current account deficits (26 percent of GDP in 2014) highlight competitiveness concerns stemming from the challenging business climate and significant infrastructure gaps (Figures 2 and 3). Non-oil exports remained weak in 2014 despite the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate by 2.6 percent in 2014. Congo remains in the lowest 10 percentile rank on the World Bank’s overall ‘Ease of Doing Business’ score. Scores are particularly low for the ease of obtaining credit and electricity, and the quality of the insolvency regime. Page 15 Figure 2.
