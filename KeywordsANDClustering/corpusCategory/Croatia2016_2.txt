The fledgling recovery has gained traction during 2015, notwithstanding a slowdown in the last quarter (Figure 1 and Table 1). The external environment was supportive with strong trading partner growth, particularly in Italy, Slovenia, and Germany; lagged effects of full access to EU markets; low energy prices; and ample global liquidity. Private consumption also began to recover, aided by an increase in disposable income due to an upward shift in the income tax thresholds and low energy costs. Public investment grew, in particular in SOEs, while private investment growth finally turned positive, in part reflecting a mild improvement in business confidence. Growth was broad based with relatively strong performance across many sectors, including manufacturing, trade, transportation, and accommodation and food services. Consumer prices have largely been declining over the past two years, mainly due to lower energy and food prices. Non-food and non-energy inflation has been steady, although low by historical standards. Unemployment declined only slightly since 2014 and remains very high . Both structural and cyclical unemployment rates—estimated at 11½ percent and 5 percent respectively—are much worse than in peers. Unemployment is particularly high among the youth and low-skilled workers, and in less-developed regions. The participation rate (close to 50 percent) is also lower than in most peers. Nevertheless, some employers reportedly have difficulties in attracting seasonal workers, particularly in retail and catering. In May 2016, the EC published its country-specific recommendations to address Croatia’s macroeconomic imbalances (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm) and its assessment of the Convergence Program (http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific- recommendations/index_en.htm) Growth in Value Added and Sectoral Contributions(Percent) Other Manufacturing Trade, transportation, accommodation and food service Construction Jan-13Nov-13Sep-14Jul-15 Inflation Developments Headline Core All items less energy and food Sources:Croatian National Bank and Croatian Central Bureau of Statistics. Page 11 The external current account moved further into surplus in 2015, and external debt declined somewhat (Figure 2). Export growth was about 12 percent in real terms and was broad based. Moreover, Croatia experienced a record tourist season—with an increase in the number of tourist arrivals and nights of 9.1 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. Although import growth accelerated toward end-2015, the current account surplus increased from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 5.2 percent of GDP. However, almost half of this increase was due to a one-off decline in profits of foreign-owned banks (about 2 percent of GDP) related to the conversion of Swiss franc loans (Annex I). Deleveraging continued and contributed to a reduction in external debt to about 104 percent of GDP from 108 percent of GDP a year earlier. The 2015 general government deficit was substantially smaller than anticipated. The deficit declined to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014 (ESA2010 definition). This was due to a cyclical upturn in revenue (estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP) and under-execution of public enterprise investment in the fourth quarter during the care-taker government (estimated at 0.8 percent of GDP). There were also some consolidation efforts, including an increase in excises on fuel and tobacco, the full-year effect of the 2014 increase in health insurance contributions, and improved tax administration. On the expenditure side, measures were taken to contain the wage bill (mainly amending seniority bonuses) and subsidies (as some agricultural subsidies are now being paid directly by the EU Agricultural Guarantee Fund). As a result, public debt finally stabilized at close to 87 percent of GDP. The kuna exchange rate to the euro has remained stable, with a slightly stronger than usual seasonal appreciation since February 2016 (Figure 3). The quasi-peg continued to be preserved through tight FX liquidity regulation and occasional FX interventions . The conversion of Swiss franc household loans to euros necessitated FX intervention amounting to €0.27 billion to close banks’ net open positions. Nonetheless, gross international reserves increased by €1 billion to €13.7 billion (equivalent to 102 percent of short-term debt by remaining maturity) during 2015—benefitting from the government’s issuance of €1.5 billion 10-year Eurobond in March, which was over-subscribed, at a yield of 3.25 percent. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) maintained a relatively accommodative monetary stance within the limitations of the quasi-peg by ensuring ample excess liquidity, but bank About 12 percentage points of the debt are account for by intercompany debt. Croatia’s de jure exchange rate regime is classified by the Fund as a managed float without a predetermined path, and its de facto regime is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The conversion of Swiss franc household loans into euro triggered a temporary net open position of banks, which the CNB partially alleviated by selling foreign currency.

The interest rates of some standing facilities were reduced and several measures were taken to ensure ample liquidity. These measures included broadening the list of securities eligible for CNB facilities, adjusting required reserves, and a quarterly four-year structural reverse repo facility was introduced in February 2016. However, banks’ claims on non-financial enterprises and households declined further by 4.7 percent and 8.0 percent from March 2015 to March 2016. The stability of the banking sector has been maintained despite the drawn-out recession . On average, the banking system, which is primarily foreign-owned (Austrian and Italian), is liquid and well-capitalized (21.0 percent CAR at end-2015). Banks remained profitable during the recession, with the exception of 2015 due to losses from the Swiss franc loan conversion. With the continued buildup of deposits and subdued lending, deleveraging has continued. The non- performing loan (NPL) ratio seems to have stabilized, but remains high (16.3 percent of loans). Nonetheless, NPLs are fairly provisioned. In 2015, one small, but regionally important, bank began the resolution process in accordance with the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.
