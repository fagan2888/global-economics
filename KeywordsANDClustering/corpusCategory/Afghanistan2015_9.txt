Pro-poor spending peaked in 2014 as a result of higher payments to families of martyrs and disabled. Pro-poor spending stood at 3.1 percent of GDP in 2014 compared to 2.3 percent in 2013. Owing to challenges in securing donor support to finance operations and maintenance spending on health and education, and better targeting of pensions to families of martyrs and disabled, the budgeted pro-poor spending is projected to amount to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015, a floor in the SMP. The authorities are committed to continue supporting families of martyrs and disabled and improving the targeting of these payments. They reiterated that the definition of pro-poor spending in the budget was rather narrow, since it comprised only the ministries of education, health, and social affairs (about 40 percent of non-security/non- development outlays), and indicated that most government spending favored the poor. The authorities have a plan to foster inclusion and reduce poverty in the context of the SMAF. This plan includes specific short-term actions to provide impetus to their inclusive growth strategy. To provide security and end land-grabbing affecting the urban poor, the government will launch a national program to survey informal settlements and provide 100 percent coverage of land tenure certificates in main cities by the end of December 2015. Further, a program will be launched by December 2015 to provide at least 5,000 rural communities with funds for labor-intensive works to repair agricultural infrastructure. By year-end, the government will launch a pilot program for market gardening in urban peripheries to promote food self-sufficiency, and complete new power distribution systems to provide electricity to 40,000 poor households. In the first half of 2016, the government will form a commission to review use of child labor in the carpet industry and provide reform and compliance recommendations to meet Afghanistan's commitments to end the use of child labor.
