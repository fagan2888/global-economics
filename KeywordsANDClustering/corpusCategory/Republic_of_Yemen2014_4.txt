Reforms will aim to address both short-term challenges and lay the foundations for medium- and -long term inclusive and sustainable growth . The key objectives are to contain the negative macroeconomic impact of the recent oil shock, and to gradually reorient fiscal and monetary policies to create the conditions for high inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. Financial sector and structural reforms are also key to meeting these goals. While being strong, the design of the reform program takes into account the difficult social and political conditions through appropriate sequencing and protection of the poor. The structural measures that will help achieve these objectives and goals are listed in Table 2 of the MEFP (Appendix 1).
