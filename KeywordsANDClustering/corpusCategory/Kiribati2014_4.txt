Staff supports the extensive SOE reforms undertaken by the government with the assistance of the AsDB. The closures of underperforming SOE have significantly reduced fiscal risks, including through the reduction of outstanding government guarantees. Government plans for the near term include privatizing certain enterprises and effectively implementing key provisions of the new SOE Act, particularly in the areas of SOEs’ strategies formulation and financial reporting. Measures towards commercialization of SOEs and improving the operational efficiency of some others are all steps in the right direction. Nevertheless, realistic expectations need to be made about the commercial viability of those public enterprises that fulfill social mandates, including the shipping company that services the outer and dispersed smaller islands. Adequately complying with the government’s debt and guarantee policy as well as enhancing the oversight and accountability according to the recently introduced SOE Act should contain these fiscal risks. Authorities’ Views The government is committed to the SOE reform agenda. The authorities indicated that visible success in SOE reforms has increased the community’s buy-in for other public sector reorganization policies pursued by the government. The authorities acknowledge that even with privatization of some public enterprises, structural factors impede private sector activities. Lack of management expertise and the unavoidable cost disadvantages of geography and diseconomies of scale mean that government will continue to tolerate some loss-making by key public enterprises.
