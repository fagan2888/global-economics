Discussions focused on Tunisia’s need to accelerate growth, make it more inclusive, and provide high-quality jobs. This requires maintaining macroeconomic stability—through high-quality fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and greater exchange rate flexibility—in a context of high security threats, social demands, and downside risks. This pre-requisite to growth should be accompanied by the decisive and timely implementation of ambitious structural reforms to improve budget composition, strengthen the financial system, and improve the business environment. All these elements are essential to achieve higher and more inclusive growth and make a significant dent in unemployment.
