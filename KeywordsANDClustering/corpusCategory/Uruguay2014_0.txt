Uruguay’s economy performed strongly over the last decade and has so far weathered the regional slowdown quite well . Buoyant FDI inflows since 2005 have contributed to strong growth in productivity and real incomes. Per capita income has risen by 75 percent following the 2002 crisis, while poverty and inequality have declined to historic lows (Box 1). The public sector balance sheet has been fortified substantially, with net public debt at less than half its post-crisis peak and the average maturity of central government debt among the longest in the world. Investments in renewable energy have started reducing the country’s dependence on oil imports and the volatility of the public sector balance. Uruguay’s economy is now cooling off in the context of a regional slowdown, but has achieved a robust pace of growth through 2014. Entrenching strong growth in the medium term will require taking policy actions to reinforce macroeconomic stability as well as accelerating supply-enhancing reforms . Robust growth in recent years has been accompanied by above target inflation and a marked decline in the primary fiscal balance. Although near term risks seem manageable given Uruguay’s strong liquidity cushions, the uncertain external environment calls for continued prudence in macroeconomic management. The aftermath of the elections is an auspicious time to take forward a policy agenda to consolidate macroeconomic stability, strengthen institutions, and accelerate supply-side reforms.
