The current account surplus continued its secular decline in 2014, falling to 0.5 percent of GDP. The yen’s real effective depreciation in 2014 failed to arrest the decline in Japan’s trade balance, though it helped the tourism balance. Exports started to pick up in the second half of 2014 supported by gradual economic recovery overseas, but were outpaced by import growth on rising import penetration in electronics and smartphones. A rising income balance surplus from higher interest income on overseas investment moderated the impact. With the sharp fall in oil and commodity prices, the goods trade balance turned to surplus in 2015:Q1 for the first time since 2011:Q1 before the Great East Japan Earthquake.
