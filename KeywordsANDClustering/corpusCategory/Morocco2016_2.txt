Following the parliamentary elections held on October 7, 2016, policy continuity is expected. The incumbent Justice and Development Party (PJD) won the highest number of seats. Therefore, the current Head of Government will lead the future government. Discussions on a new coalition government are still underway, but it is likely to involve the same political parties as in the current government, and staff believes that current policy and reform commitments will be maintained. Growth has slowed in 2016, while youth unemployment remains high . Growth has been sluggish since the global financial crisis, as non- agricultural activity remained subdued. In 2016, a sharp contraction in agricultural output and lower non-agricultural activity than projected at the time of the PLL request should reduce growth to 1.5 percent. However, economic indicators point to stronger non-agricultural activity in the second half of 2016. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.6 percent in Q3-2016 from 10.1 percent in the same period of last year, while youth unemployment increased to 21.8 percent from 21.4 percent in the same period of last year.

The fiscal deficit is expected to be further reduced in 2016, to 3.5 percent of GDP, and public debt is sustainable. After culminating at 7.3 percent of GDP in 2012, the deficit was reduced to 4.5 percent in 2015 through strong policies, including energy subsidy reforms, resilient public revenues, and well contained public expenditures. In 2016, tax revenues performed better than projected, but grant revenues (mostly from Gulf countries) were lower than anticipated (39 percent of expected amount at end-October). Public spending on wages, interest payments and subsidies Page 12 were below expectations, while capital expenditures continued to increase (76 percent of budget at end-October). Public debt is sustainable and expected to peak at 64.3 percent of GDP in 2016. Monetary policy remains accommodative . After declining to 0.3 percent in January 2016 (y-o-y), headline inflation reached 1.6 percent in October due to increasing food and energy prices, while core inflation increased to 1.1 percent. Average inflation is projected to remain at around 1.6 percent in 2016. Bank-Al-Maghrib (BAM) lowered its policy rate to 2.25 percent in March 2016, the first reduction since end-2014. Real Estate Index, 2003Q4-2016Q3 (2006Q1 = 100) Credit growth has recently started to recover as economic activity is picking up. Following a credit boom in the mid-2000s, the credit to GDP ratio grew below trend, particularly after 2012 (Box 1). Credit growth picked up only recently, reaching 4 percent in September (y-o-y). These trends have reflected a combination of corporate deleveraging and increasing household indebtedness in recent years, the latter becoming relatively large by emerging market (EM) standards (based on ratios to GDP and household income). With stronger economic activity in the second half of the year, investment lending has been a key driver of credit growth more recently. Mortgage lending remains moderate (about 5 percent y-o-y) and there is no indication of a housing price bubble. Sources: Bank Al-Maghrib; and IMF staff estimates. Banks are well capitalized, but rising non-performing loans, credit concentration risks, and expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are sources of concern (see flow chart). Banks’ regulatory capital ratio stood at 13.7 percent in 2015. Profitability declined during 2010–15 but recovered in 2016. While provisioning levels are high, NPLs have been rising since 2012, reaching 8 percent in September 2016 (against 7.4 percent in 2015), driven by weak economic activity and strains in parts of the corporate sector, including in construction. The banking system also remains vulnerable to credit concentration risks: despite strict regulatory limits and declining aggregate exposure (302 percent of T1 capital against 341 in 2014), stress test results suggest that the failure of the top three largest corporate exposures (mostly SOEs) may lead to the under-capitalization of several banks. Finally, the expansion of Moroccan banks into SSA provides diversification and profit opportunities, but also opens new channels of risk transmission, as such riskier cross-border exposures now account for about 20 percent of their assets, and some banks are systemically important in certain host countries. The current account deficit has widened in 2016, but reserves continue to strengthen. The current account deficit is expected to reach 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016 against 2.2 percent in 2015. This reflects increased machinery and food imports, and weaker export growth, as the impact See also Selected Issues Paper on “Morocco—Credit Growth: Demand or Supply Driven?” Page 13 of low phosphate prices offset stronger automobile, agriculture and textile exports. Tourism and remittances revenues have rebounded in 2016, offsetting lower-than-expected official grants from GCC countries, while FDI inflows remain sizeable. Reserves strengthened further and should reach 100 percent of the Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric by the end of 2016 (or 131 percent the adjusted ARA metric). The net international investment position (NIIP) is expected to decline slightly to -62½ percent of GDP, while external debt, amounting to 32.4 percent of GDP, should remain moderate and sustainable. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated marginally since mid-2015, increasing 3.7 percent (y-o-y) at end-November 2016 due to the strengthening of the US dollar. The IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) indicates that the external position is broadly aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals and policies (Annex II). Morocco. Key Macro-Financial Linkages The IMF’s EBA methodology includes three approaches to evaluating the external position relative to fundamentals and desirable policies: (i) the current account approach suggests a current account gap of -0.9 percent of GDP relative to the norm, equivalent to an REER overvaluation of 3.1 percent (compared to 7 percent in Spring 2016); (ii) the external sustainability approach suggests an REER undervaluation of 9.7 percent; however this estimate tends to be very sensitive to the underlying benchmark on net foreign assets; (iii) the REER approach suggests an undervaluation of 6.4 percent, but data limitations affect the robustness of this estimate. Given measurement issues in the latter two approaches, staff’s preferred approach is the current account approach, which suggests that on balance, the dirham is broadly aligned with fundamentals.
