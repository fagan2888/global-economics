Despite strong growth in recent years, key social indicators remain below averages for sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1). Long-standing structural challenges a large informal sector, income inequality, high unemployment, and growth disparities among regions together with significant infrastructure gaps and weak institutional capacity have constrained progress toward meeting the national goal of top-20 nation status by 2020. The Transformation Agenda is advancing, but the political environment has become more difficult, with increasing attention on the 2015 elections and concerns about ongoing security problems in the North. Consequently, it could be difficult to build consensus among the various tiers of government on the urgency of continuing structural reform. The authorities have advanced their structural reform agenda, drawing on past staff advice (Box 1). Notable progress has been achieved in the fiscal sector improved administration of the fuel subsidy, increased coverage of the Treasury Single Account, and developing information management modules to better formulate the budget. In the financial sector, progress was made in enhancing consolidated and cross-border bank supervision, building capacity for effective implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and adopting a macroprudential framework. The privatization of power generation and distribution was completed, and a seed and fertilizer program has significantly increased rice production. However, access to finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has lagged and legislation to strengthen the petroleum sector has been delayed.
