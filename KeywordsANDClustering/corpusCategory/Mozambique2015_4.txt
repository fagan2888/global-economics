The central bank’s NIR have declined markedly in 2015, mostly due to a series of external shocks. Cumulative losses in NIR amounted to $1.1 billion between September 2014 and October 2015 as foreign exchange inflows declined substantially due to: (i) Mozambique’s exports being hit by sharp declines in international commodity prices from late 2014, both for commodity and traditional exports; (ii) foreign direct investment in the natural gas sector coming to a halt, with the exploration phase concluded and investment in processing facilities awaiting finalization of key production agreements between the government and concessionaires; (iii) absence of revenues from capital gain taxes in 2015 (which had supported the budget and NIR levels in 2013-14) and (iv) declines in external aid flows. Unforeseen renewed pressures since June (Box 2) have rendered the end-2015 target agreed at the time of the fourth review unattainable (see paragraphs 6, 7). While significant policy adjustment is now underway to ensure that reserves are safeguarded, a more timely policy reaction would have been preferable. The authorities implemented measures agreed in the fourth review; in particular, the fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2015 from 10.4 percent in 2014. However, import demand has thus far remained high—partly due to a lingering impact of the major 2014 fiscal policy slippages—although the authorities let the exchange rate depreciate (see above) and the metical is now being broadly fairly valued (Annex 1). Given the adverse shocks to external inflows, import levels have become unsustainable and a more immediate policy reaction would have been preferable to redress the situation. Especially, a tighter monetary stance than agreed at the time of the fourth review would have been desirable to counteract NIR losses. Adherence to the initial reserve money targets meant that the central bank was reinjecting through open market operations part of the domestic currency liquidity that was being withdrawn through foreign exchange sales. This impaired the automatic adjustment mechanism to the balance of payment pressures. Page 23 Box 2. Impact of External Shocks This box illustrates how renewed external shocks can explain most of the reserve losses in 2015 by causing higher BOP pressures than anticipated at the time of the fourth review of the PSI-supported program: Mozambique’s exports—having already fallen short of projections by $170 million during the first half of 2015—are performing worse on account of further declines in key commodity prices, especially for aluminum and natural gas but also affecting traditional exports. Coal companies have reacted to continued low coal prices by limiting export volume growth to contain their losses. Foreign direct investment for megaprojects has come to a halt—halving during the first semester of 2015—with finalization of key production agreements between the government and concessionaires taking longer than expected previously, delaying investments in coal infrastructure in LNG processing facilities. Aid disbursements have continued their longer-term downward trend in 2015, in contrast to fourth review projections which proved too optimistic in projecting a slight rebound. Finally, the BM’s international reserves, when evaluated in US dollars, suffered from further valuation losses after June as a result of continued dollar strength. Although only a relatively small proportion of this investment spent on procurement of domestic value added, the additional impact is notable, given the sheer size of such investment and its steep decline.

Page 24 Further policy adjustments are required to stabilize the BOP and start rebuilding international reserves. Policy adjustment is most critical to stabilize the BOP, with Fund financing filling the remaining financing gap and ensuring that other donor support proceeds as planned. Policy adjustment is projected to reduce imports by about $1 billion per year and will make the BOP sustainable after its full impact has materialized by the end of the 18-month SCF program. Fund financing amounts to SDR 204.5 million (approximately $285 million) over the course of the program and is expected to serve a catalytic role. In the near term, the authorities’ ongoing engagement with the Fund ensures that planned World Bank disbursements, including for budget support, go ahead as planned. In 2016 and beyond, the engagement will continue to underpin confidence of the broader donor community. Staff and the authorities agreed on a policy mix based on three interrelated pillars designed to allow rebuilding of reserves to commence in 2016. These three pillars are (1) further fiscal adjustment of two percent of GDP, which will generate a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2016 (the projected 6.0 percent of GDP in 2015 is already significantly lower than programmed); (2) the monetary policy tightening cycle initiated in October and intensified in November; and (3) reforming the FX market and allow for continued exchange rate flexibility. These policies will be supported by a gradual phasing out of the guaranteed sales of US dollars for fuel imports and minimal discretionary intervention to smooth out exchange rate volatility, with the authorities standing ready to undertake further policy adjustment to safeguard reserves in case BOP pressures remain higher than expected. The front-loaded implementation of this corrective policy package, with the planned adoption of the 2016 budget by mid-December 2015 and the implementation of the monetary and foreign exchange market measures in November 2015, aim at providing support to the shoring up of reserves right from the start of the program. The policy mix will be supported by an ambitious structural reform agenda with an added emphasis on critical PFM reforms and managing fiscal risks on public enterprises (including EMATUM). As a result of the policy adjustment under the SCF/PSI, NIR are expected to bottom out during the first half of 2016 before resuming a path of gradual recovery that would return import coverage ratios back to comfortable levels. Given the level of NIR in October 2015 and projected foreign disbursements for the remainder of the year, the end-2015 NIR level is projected to be just above $2 billion. The tightening of monetary and fiscal policies should restrain imports significantly in 2016, adding to the lagged impact of the substantial depreciation of the metical. Policy adjustment, together with an expected modest resumption of FDI, should result in sufficient dollar liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market by mid-2016 to allow the BM to discontinue interventions for fuel imports and gradually start purchasing dollars to rebuild reserves. Import coverage of gross international reserves is projected to increase to The phasing out results from the impact of the corrective policy package on imports demand, which will materialize with some lags. In the meantime, the BM needs to continue to stand ready to provide sufficient foreign exchange to the commercial banks to avoid any interruption in fuel supplies. Page 25 4.5 months of non-megaproject imports by end-2016 (from 4.2 months of imports at end-2015). The shallowness and current illiquidity of the interbank foreign exchange market impair the central bank’s ability to purchase significant amounts of foreign exchange in the market and to pursue significantly more ambitious NIR targets in 2016. Fiscal Policy The main objective of fiscal policy in 2016 is to ensure debt sustainability and contribute to the required external adjustment. In 2016, net domestic financing will be slightly negative (0.2 percent of GDP), which will contribute negatively to money creation and help prevent crowding out pressures Beyond 2016, the main objective will be to put debt accumulation on a downward path. In that regard, the authorities concurred with staff’s recommendation on a more rapid fiscal consolidation in the medium term than envisaged in the review. With regards to external borrowing, the program targets are set based on the authorities’ appropriately prudent 2016 borrowing plan Reflecting the Fund’s updated debt limits policy, targets are now present-value based and cover total external borrowing instead of non- concessional borrowing only (see the authorities’ borrowing plan in Tables 8. 9). By eliminating a rigid concessionality threshold, they should afford the authorities more flexibility in loan negotiations. Mozambique: External Financing Current Projections vs. 4 Review Projections (in USD million) In light of rising debt levels and persistent BOP pressures, staff and the authorities agreed on a significantly tighter fiscal stance in 2016 (see text table below) to underpin the SCF. The overall fiscal deficit (after grants) is projected to decline by 2 percentage points of GDP to 4 percent of GDP in 2016 and the domestic primary balance would improve by about 2¼ percent of GDP, significantly more than previously envisaged. Total revenues are projected to expand by 1 percent of GDP in 2016. This increase is expected to be generated by (i) strong performance in international trade taxes—as the These ratios include disbursements under the SCF-supported program.

(a) - (b) Page 26 depreciation boosts the taxable base in domestic currency, (ii) an increase in gas royalties, and (iii) tax administration reforms to facilitate revenue mobilization (stamp taxes for alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, common custom tariffs and excise duties.) Fiscal adjustment is driven by a reduction of about 1½ percent of GDP in public spending relative to 2015. A substantial part of the fiscal adjustment will fall on current spending, including subsidies and the wage bill, but public investment will be adjusted downward as well in line with implementation capacity and more rigorous selection criteria The government is committed to further reducing the wage bill by 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 2016 through a deceleration in the pace of new hiring and by stronger administrative controls on salary payments . The latter will involve (i) requirements to regularly produce "proofs of life" statements for all civil servants, and (ii) strict limits on new hiring in non priority sectors (i.e., excluding the health, education, agriculture and police sectors). At current international oil prices, no provision for fuel subsidies is required in the 2016 budget. Should international oil prices increase, the government indicated that they will consider adjustments in the price setting formula to prevent the need for new subsidies. If the formula cannot be adjusted in a timely manner for political economy reasons, any subsidies accrued would be financed through downward adjustments in other non-priority spending to ensure the achievement of the budget target. Public investment projects will be subject to more rigorous evaluation procedures to enhance investment efficiency and ensure greater value for money.

Mozambique: Fiscal Adjustment in 2016 Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies Decisive action is required to curb inflationary pressures and help stabilize the foreign exchange market. Staff commended the BM on its decision to initiate a cycle of monetary tightening in its October Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to further tighten monetary policy, given the worsening foreign exchange market conditions and the loss of NIR and to attempt to reduce dollar hoarding behavior by increasing the attractiveness of holding deposits in domestic currency. Depreciation is being passed through to domestic prices, which, together with several expected adjustments in administered prices, is expected to push inflation above the BM’s target range of 5-6 percent by end-2016. The BM raised the required reserve requirement by 100 basis points in October and again by 150 basis points in November. It also increased its standing lending (FPC) rate by 25 basis points and its standing deposit (FPD) rates by 50 basis points in October, with a further 50 basis point increase in the FPC rate and 75 basis point increase in the FPD rate in November. It is expected that this tightening will reduce credit growth and the demand for dollars in the MEFP ¶5 (Change with respect to 2015, in percent of GDP) CommentsTotal Revenue 1.0derived from the combination of a higher volume of goods imports in US dollars and a more depreciated exchange rate vis- à -vis the US dollar, increase in gas in-kind royalties, as well as administrative reforms in key areas, for instance, stamp taxes for alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, common custom tariffs and excise duties Total Expenditure and Net Lending Current Expenditure -1.1adjustment entails: (1) a deceleration in the public servants hiring rate (which has increased substantially in the last years) and an augmentation of controls on the salary payments system, and (2) decrease in transfer payments, specifically fuel subsidies Capital Expenditure and Net Lending -0.3mainly through a reduction in externally financed capital expenditure Domestic Primary Balance, Before Grants Overall Balance, After Grants 2.0 Source: IMF staff estimates. Page 28 foreign exchange market. The mission and BM also agreed on the need to keep reserve money growth at 12 percent in 2016, somewhat below nominal GDP growth, representing a significant deceleration compared to previous years, and tightening monetary policy further in 2016 should the pressures on the foreign exchange market and inflation persist. The BM took action to remove the distortion in the foreign exchange market (MCI), which had previously skewed commercial banks’ demand for interventions by the BM. The BM intervenes in the market through the MCI computer screen, based on buying and selling quotes posted by 16 participating banks. Besides the MCI system, these banks also negotiated and traded outside the system, at exchange rates that did not always correspond to the MCI rates due to the shallowness and illiquidity of the interbank foreign exchange market. The spread between the BM’s intervention rate and the interbank rate increased since the last review under the PSI, generating incentives for commercial banks to mobilize foreign exchange from the BM instead of purchasing them from their clients. In November, banks quoted buy and sale rates on the MCI computer screen consistent with the interbank rate, hence bringing this spread to zero. C.
