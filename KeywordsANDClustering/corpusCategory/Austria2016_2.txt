Growth is projected to slow in the medium term, while inflation would gradually normalize. In 2017, GDP growth is projected to slow marginally to 1.3 percent as the 2016 fiscal stimulus tapers off. Current momentum in private investment and employment, strengthening demand in major trading partners, and positive credit growth, supported by the ECBâ€™s accommodative policy stance, should underpin GDP growth around that level. In the medium term, the closing negative output gap and the projected moderate fiscal consolidation should see growth revert to its potential rate of just above 1 percent. With the output gap eventually turning mildly positive, inflation should run somewhat above 2 percent in the medium term.
