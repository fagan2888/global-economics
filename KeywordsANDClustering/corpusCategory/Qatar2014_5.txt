The authorities and staff concurred that developing deep and liquid domestic debt markets can bring important benefits. These include funding for the large infrastructure investment program, enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism, and facilitating liquidity management. Indeed, the government has been issuing Riyal-denominated securities with the stated objective of debt market development despite running large fiscal surpluses. Going forward, the authorities will continue issuing Riyal-denominated government securities, while trimming foreign borrowing and domestic loans. The authorities noted additional measures aimed at financial deepening. The forthcoming creation of the domestic credit rating agency will support corporate bond issuance, while the public investment program provides an opportunity to issue corporate bonds for revenue- generating projects. The expanded coverage of the credit bureau is facilitating easier access to credit. Additional initiatives to improve consumer and investor protection and strengthen market infrastructure are envisaged in the Strategic Plan for Financial Regulation, as outlined in the text table above.
