Discussions covered the macroeconomic, financial, and structural policies needed to support stability, reduce vulnerabilities, and strengthen economic growth and income prospects . Staff recognized that some important stabilization and reform measures have already been taken, but urged additional front-loaded and deeper structural measures to: (i) mitigate significant and rising risks to sovereign, financial sector, and external stability; (ii) achieve higher sustainable levels of medium-term growth and income; and (iii) provide well-funded and targeted SSNs to mitigate the impact of reforms.
