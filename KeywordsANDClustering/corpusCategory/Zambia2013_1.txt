Government objectives. The government’s Sixth National Development Plan aims to make Zambia a prosperous middle income country with an economic program leading to inclusive growth. Large public investment, particularly on roads and electricity, will lessen key constraints to economic development. Moreover, a rural focus will support pro-poor growth and an ambitious target for job creation has been established. Page 8 Policy priorities. Preserving the economy’s hard won macroeconomic stability calls for a reduction of the fiscal deficit and increased international reserves. This will require mobilizing additional domestic revenue, realigning spending priorities, and creating fiscal space for infrastructure investment, while also maintaining a business environment that encourages job creation. At the same time, the targeted transformation of the Zambian economy requires fundamental administrative and institutional reforms to promote credible policy implementation, higher efficiency of public infrastructure investment, and deeper financial intermediation.
