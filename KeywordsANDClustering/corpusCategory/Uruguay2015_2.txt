GDP growth is expected to remain tepid at 1.4 percent in 2016 as external conditions remain weak and consumer confidence has dropped . Adding to weak external demand, the further slowdown in fiscal spending and consumption is likely to temper domestic demand. Despite a projected moderate deterioration in the terms of trade relative to 2015, the current account deficit is projected to hold steady at 4 percent of GDP as lower demand for imports broadly offsets weaker foreign demand for exports. In the medium-term, growth is expected to rise back to a potential rate of 3.1 percent as external demand and investment recover. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 3½ percent of GDP in the medium-term, as external demand recovers.

Page 21 Risks to the outlook are mostly external The immediate region . Although Uruguay’s regional economic ties have lessened, a worse- than-expected slowdown in Argentina and Brazil could significantly weigh on Uruguay’s economy. Historically, spillovers from Argentina have had the largest impact, with the country accounting for more than half of Uruguay’s sizeable tourism receipts, and importing mostly specialized manufactured products without obvious alternative markets. Although Brazil imports one-fifth of Uruguay’s merchandise exports (four times more than Argentina), these are predominantly commodities, for which thus far alternative markets could be more readily found. The role of financial linkages as a transmission channel for regional shocks has decreased significantly in the past decade. Also, there has been no evidence of contagion in the sovereign bond market resulting from recent events in Brazil. Non-resident deposits (mostly from Argentina) have declined to 16 percent of total deposits, making a potential rapid withdrawal manageable in light of banks’ plentiful foreign currency liquidity. Nevertheless, Argentina and Brazil still accounted for about a third of FDI inflows into Uruguay in 2013. The global economy . A global slowdown would affect Uruguay’s commodity exports, and increased volatility in oil prices would affect import costs. However, the agricultural content of Uruguay’s commodity exports (two-thirds of the total) makes the country less vulnerable than other commodity exporters to a slowdown or further rebalancing in China from investment to consumption. While increased volatility in oil prices would affect Uruguay, which imports all of its oil, the positive correlation between agricultural commodity prices and oil prices has so far provided a natural hedge. A tightening in global financial conditions could raise the cost of financing: empirical analysis indicates that the impact of the Fed’s tapering announcement in May 2013 on local and foreign currency bond yields in Uruguay was moderate and broadly in line with the region. The high share of nonresident holdings of Uruguay’s public debt may pose an external risk.

While domestic confidence indicators point to weaker demand, near-term financial risks seem limited . The reliability of the confidence indicators in foretelling domestic consumption and investment is hard to gauge, as is the potential impact of further regional turmoil on domestic confidence. In addition, a possible further rise in deposit dollarization could contribute to pressure on the exchange rate. However, there is no evidence of a credit bubble or excessive private sector leverage. Banks’ regulatory capital ratio has declined over the last few years, in an effort to reduce the costs of excess capital. The banking system remains adequately capitalized and an uptick in non- performing loans in 2015 does not, at this stage, seem a cause for significant concern, as provisions for loan losses remain high. Foreign currency credit to unhedged borrowers in the non-tradable sector has also moderated from its 2013 high, although close monitoring of this ratio remains warranted, particularly given the recent peso depreciation. Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers should facilitate an orderly adjustment to shocks Government financing risks are limited given access to contingent credit lines (including from the World Bank and IaDB) amounting to 4 percent of GDP and liquid financial assets (6 percent of GDP) sufficient to cover debt service through the end of 2016. Furthermore, the average maturity of public debt is high, at 15.5 years, reducing short-term risks. The BCU’s ample gross reserves could help cushion severe external shocks. Taking into account Uruguay’s high level of financial sector dollarization (80 percent of deposits and 60 percent of banking system loans are in U.S. dollars), reserves still cover 96 percent of end-2014 foreign currency deposits, and almost four times the amount of end-2014 non-resident deposits (Annex I).

Relative Likelihood High Impact if Realized Medium/Low (↓) Further peso depreciation could continue to put upward pressure on inflation. It could also raise the default rate on FX loans to unhedged borrowers. Near-term public sector financing risks would be limited given comfortable levels of liquid dollar assets and high average debt maturity. External financing risks would be contained by the high level of reserves and the high share of FDI-financing of the current account deficit.

High Medium ( ↑ ) Uruguay imports all its oil (fuel products accounted for 20 percent of imports from 2010–14), so a persistent drop in oil prices would lower the import bill and have a positive macroeconomic impact.

Page 26 The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s outlook but saw smaller regional spillover risks. They foresaw somewhat higher growth in 2015 and 2016 than in the staff’s baseline projection. They nuanced the risks stemming from possible deeper Brazilian and Argentinean recessions, noting that Uruguay had already successfully absorbed significant shocks from the region. They also emphasized the decline in the estimated correlation between growth in Argentina and Uruguay and offered that Uruguay could benefit from the dismantling of existing Argentinean trade restrictions. They considered that domestic reform implementation risk was low, pointing to the recent approval of the five-year budget by Parliament without any additional expenditure increase, and progress in the wage negotiations in accordance with the government’s guidelines.
