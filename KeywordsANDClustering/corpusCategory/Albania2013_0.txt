Albania was not directly affected by recent crisis. It successfully avoided recession in the aftermath of the global crisis and suffered a milder growth shock than neighboring countries. Inflation was kept low and stable. The banking sector maintained adequate capital and liquidity. This performance was largely the result of an early fiscal stimulus, effective monetary policy, and macroprudential actions. Recently, the economy has shown signs of protracted weakness and macroeconomic imbalances have widened, partly because of policy indiscipline. Public debt and financing needs—among the highest regionally and heavily dependent on banks—have risen because of fiscal slippage and accumulation of sizable arrears, particularly in 2013H1. As a result, investor confidence has suffered, contributing to the economic slowdown. Rising NPLs and bank risk aversion, as well as incomplete investment climate reforms, have amplified the slowdown (Figures 1–7). Implementation of earlier Article IV consultation recommendations has been mixed. The authorities have strengthened financial sector supervision and stretched the maturity profile of public debt in line with 2012 Article IV consultation recommendations, but there was little progress on fiscal consolidation (Box 1). The new government is committed to economic and structural reforms. A stronger than usual electoral majority in the 2013 elections has allowed the new authorities to launch difficult public finance and structural reforms, including those required for EU accession. While the EU has acknowledged progress, it has recently postponed the candidacy decision till mid 2014, citing the need for a sustained record of judiciary, parliament and public administration reforms. A strong reform push that improves perceptions about EU accession prospects would help boost business confidence, FDI and growth. Page 6 Figure 1.

Inflation has remained low and stable... …confidence in some key sectors remains weak… … and services and agriculture sectors have slowed.
