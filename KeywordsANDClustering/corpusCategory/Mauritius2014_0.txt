The Mauritian economy has been growing steadily despite weak activity in Europe— its main trading partner. This resilience has been supported by successive fiscal stimuli together with increased diversification of export destinations. However, the economy still operates slightly below potential and domestic investment has been falling. Going forward renewed reform efforts are needed to accelerate the country’s objective of attaining high-income status. Addressing infrastructure gaps and enhancing the efficiency of the public sector (particularly state-owned enterprises, SOEs) would support further productivity gains. Mauritius’ institutions are among the strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa, and have been continuously ranked number one by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. Doing Business indicators suggest that the country provides an environment that facilitates business and economic development. The country ranks 12 out of 189 economics in terms of protecting investors, and has recently improved the ease of getting credit. Its corruption perception score and transparency are also favorable. Mauritius also ranks high in terms of infrastructure, at 37 for ground transport and 69 for ICT infrastructure, both out of 140 countries. Previous recommendations regarding gradual fiscal consolidation were delayed, but monetary policy was broadly in line with recommendations. Difficult external conditions, urgent investment needs, and one-off events have delayed medium-term fiscal adjustment in 2013. Monetary policy was moderately accommodative in the context of declining inflation pressures as recommended, but little progress was made in removing excess liquidity and sharing the cost of monetary policy. There has been some progress in better targeting social protection, and improving efficiency of SOEs, but more could be done particularly regarding phasing-out subsidies and incorporating extra-budgetary (special) funds into the budget.
