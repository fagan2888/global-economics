Inflation is projected to remain elevated, above the target band, but contained. Headline inflation is rising mostly due to base effects of fuel prices, higher food prices reflecting the drought, and currency depreciation. Though headline inflation will likely peak at about 7 percent in 2016Q4 and exceed the target band for the first half of 2017, core inflation is projected at 6 percent in 2016 and to ease to 5.6 percent in 2017. Staff expect inflation to remain contained for several reasons. The output gap is projected to widen (to 2¼ percent in 2017). Imported inflation is expected to remain negative in dollars. The FX pass-through seems unlikely to jump given a widening output gap and still-solid retailers’ profits (Box 5). Unit labor costs are rising more moderately and job losses should keep them in check. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored, though slightly above 6 percent. The impact of the SARB’s hikes is still filtering through, which takes up to six quarters, and regulatory changes being phased-in will likely tighten financial conditions further. Page 28 The SARB faces difficult trade-offs and uncertainty. While cutting interest rates would be unlikely to boost growth as policy uncertainty and reduced investor confidence will likely constrain private spending, additional monetary tightening would further depress growth. And while inflation is above the band, it is mainly because of supply shocks, which are expected to subside in 2017. Core inflation is within the band. Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding inflation projections, especially due to the volatile exchange rate. Considering that additional monetary tightening would hurt an already-weak economy and the 2016 Budget envisages sizable consolidation, monetary policy could remain on hold for now. Consideration could also be given to whether greater specificity on the inflation target might help enhance communication and guide inflation expectations within the band. Authorities’ views The SARB is concerned about inflation risks and remains focused on its inflation mandate. The SARB indicates that increases in food and fuel prices, the large exchange rate depreciation, real wage growth higher than productivity, and the threat of second round effects pose elevated inflation risks. Recent Monetary Policy Statements reflect concerns that inflation expectations are cemented at the upper end of the target band, which does not leave room for shocks. Also, the fact that inflation is projected to stay outside the band for a protracted period risks unhinging inflation expectations. The SARB views the impact of its actions on economic activity as limited, and reaffirms that its utmost contribution to growth is via ensuring price stability, which the existing flexible inflation targeting regime can deliver. The SARB reiterates that they view the real policy rate to be supportive of the economy, and that any further adjustments to the monetary policy stance would be informed by incoming data and the potential impact thereof on the inflation trajectory going forward, in the context of a flexible inflation targeting framework. Staff analysis suggests that a 100bp hike could lower output by 0.3 percent after one year and 0.5 percent after two years (cumulative), and could lower the price level by 0.6 percentage points after 3 quarters and 1 percentage point after 6 quarters (cumulative).

Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Price Inflation Our estimates indicate that the FX pass-through to inflation declined markedly in the early 2000s, but has declined only slightly in recent years when the global deflationary environment helped contain inflation. The pass-through is lower when the output gap is negative. The FX pass-through has been moderate despite substantial depreciation since 2010. Core inflation’s increase from 3.0 percent in 2011Q1 to 5.5 percent in April 2016 is moderate compared to the 48 percent depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). The global deflationary environment contributed to the apparently low pass-through. The substantial decline in oil prices in 2015 reduced headline inflation and helped contain core inflation. The rising share of imports from China (to about 20 percent of non- oil imports), where PPI has been declining for four years, contributed to the decline in total foreign PPI in 2014/15. As a result, despite the sizable depreciation of the rand, non-oil import price growth declined markedly in 2015. Estimates of the FX pass-through to headline inflation in South Africa range from around 20 percent to the low 10s. The SARB has maintained its estimate of 20 percent, but some recent cross- country studies find smaller pass-through estimates. Gruss and Carriere-Swallow (2016) also finds a large decline in FX pass-through in recent years. Our estimates suggest that the FX pass-through declined markedly in the early 2000s, while it declined only slightly in recent years. We focused on non-oil import prices and core inflation as there exists an automatic mechanism for complete pass- through of fuel prices. Following Chew et al. (2011) and Kabundi and Mbelu (2016), we estimate the FX pass-through using an error correction model, focusing on non-oil import prices and core inflation using quarterly data for 1980 ─ Average long-run first- stage pass-through from the NEER to non-oil import prices (controlling for foreign producer prices) is about 80 percent, with full pass-through occurring in six quarters. Average second-stage pass-through from import prices to core inflation (controlling for unit labor costs) is about 30 percent. Rolling 10-year window estimates show large declines in overall FX pass-through around the time of the introduction of the inflation targeting regime (2000), but only small declines in recent years, to 22 percent. The pass-through is found to be smaller when the output gap is negative. This study finds little evidence that the FX pass-through is related to the size of the depreciation or exchange rate volatility. __________________ 1/ A. Kabundi and A.
