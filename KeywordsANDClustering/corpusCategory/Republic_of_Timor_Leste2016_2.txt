Growth has moderated while inflation has fallen sharply . Non-oil real GDP growth is estimated to have declined to 4¼ percent in 2015 from 5½ percent in 2014, due to reduced government spending. Total real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 0.6 percent in 2015 due to declining oil production. Both headline and core inflation eased to below 1 percent in 2014 and 2015 from double-digit levels in previous years, reflecting lower commodity prices, a stronger U.S. dollar against Timor-Leste’s trading partners’ currencies, and some improvement in supply bottlenecks (Figure 1, Table 1). The fiscal position weakened in 2015 due largely to lower petroleum revenue. Petroleum revenue fell by 40 percent in 2015 mainly on account of the slump in global oil prices. Despite lower revenues at $1.45 billion (excluding grants), in light of the smaller expenditure outturn at $1.34 billion (compared with $1.57 billion in the 2015 rectification budget ), staff estimates an overall surplus of 4.2 percent of GDP in 2015, a considerable reduction from the large surpluses in previous years. The shortfall in revenue was largely met by a substantial drawdown of the PF. Excess withdrawal (defined as withdrawal in excess of the estimated sustainable income (ESI) calculated as 3 percent of petroleum wealth—net present value of expected future petroleum revenue plus the estimated value of the PF) in 2015 was more than six times the level in the previous year. This, coupled with lower oil receipts and negative net investment return due largely to foreign exchange valuation losses, saw the balance of the PF decline for the first time, to $16.2 billion as of end-2015. Financing by external borrowing remained low at under 1 percent of GDP (Figures 2 and 3, Table 2).

However, if fully executed, the 2016 budget of $1,562.2 million (excluding donor projects) would represent an expenditure increase of 17 percent (11 percent of 2016 GDP) compared to the estimated outturn for 2015. Capital expenditures is about 49 percent higher than the 2015 estimated outturn. Current transfers would increase by 11 percent, half of which is allocated to the Oecussi SAR and ZEESM. The 2015 rectification budget was presented to the parliament on April 1, 2015 to reflect the new structure of the th constitutional government led by PM Araújo. It superseded the 2015 budget approved in December 2014. Petroleum revenue (oil/gas receipts and interest) Current account balance Trade balance 1/ 1/ Oil and gas receipts are recorded as income.

The current account surplus was halved to 25 percent of GDP in 2014 and is estimated to have shrunk further to 17 percent of GDP in 2015. This is largely due to lower income from declining oil and gas receipts and weak investment returns on the PF portfolio against weak global equity market performance in 2015. Against the backdrop of a significant appreciation of the effective exchange rate and lower commodity prices, imports is estimated to have declined by 9 percent in 2015. Non-oil exports such as coffee and tourism remain insignificant. The growth in coffee exports also slowed due to drought and low coffee prices (Table 4). Private credit growth has picked up at a moderate pace. Money supply M2 growth slowed to 7.1 percent (y/y) in December 2015 due largely to an increase in central government deposits. Growth of private sector credit picked up to 10.5 percent (y/y) in December 2015 from 5.5 percent (y/y) in the previous year. However, the bank lending survey in mid-2015 suggested that banks are cautious in lending to business enterprises due to credit risks. Credit to individuals accounted for the largest share at 43 percent, followed by the construction sector constituting 28 percent of total private sector credit as of end-2015. Excess liquidity in the banking system and banks’ overseas placements of deposits have remained high. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio declined to 23 percent as of end-December 2015 from 27 percent at end-December 2014 with full loan-loss provisions. About two-thirds are legacy bad loans with one commercial bank accumulated during the mid-2000s (Figure 4, Table 3).
