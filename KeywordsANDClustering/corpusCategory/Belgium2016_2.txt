Notwithstanding recent reform progress, major challenges continue to weigh on Belgium’s economic prospects—including high public debt and severe labor market fragmentation. The fiscal gains made in previous decades have been reversed since the crisis, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has returned to triple digits. The pace of consolidation since 2010 has been much slower than in other euro area countries, as public spending continued to grow faster than GDP until recently. With the deficit hovering around three percent of GDP, fiscal sustainability is tenuous and sensitive to potential macroeconomic shocks. While private sector employment is beginning to recover, there is entrenched high unemployment and inactivity among certain groups, including the young, the low-skilled, and non-EU immigrants. This has not only considerable human and social costs, but also detracts from Belgium’s longer-term economic potential. Belgium needs to rebuild buffers against future shocks by laying the foundations for a lasting reduction in public debt . Downside risks have already increased, as evidenced by the increased volatility in financial markets in recent months, underscoring the urgency of rebuilding buffers while growth remains solid, as projected under staff’s baseline. This requires bringing down the deficit, but doing so without undermining the recovery or social cohesion. The policy discussions thus focused on how to square this circle, in particular by making tax and expenditure policies more efficient, advancing growth-oriented reforms, and maintaining financial stability.
