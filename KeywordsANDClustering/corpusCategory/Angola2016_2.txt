The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has brought to the forefront the need to address dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and reduce vulnerabilities . As a result of the decline in oil prices, fiscal revenue and exports fell substantially, output growth came to a halt, and inflation accelerated sharply. The policy steps taken to mitigate the impact of the external shock have been significant, including an improvement of 18 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16; and devaluation of the kwanza vis-Ã -vis the U.S. dollar by over 40 percent since September 2014. However, further policy actions are needed to continue adjusting the economy to the 'new normal' in the international oil market, including additional but gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term; greater exchange rate flexibility and tight monetary conditions to address lingering imbalances in the forex market while restoring price stability; and supporting greater diversification of the economy to strengthen resilience to future oil price shocks. Vulnerabilities in the banking system also need to be addressed.
