After tropical storm Erika in August 2015, the government focused on the rehabilitation of infrastructure and meeting the needs of those affected by the storm. Since then, the rehabilitation efforts have restored some normality to daily activities. The main airport is now fully operational; electricity generation has regularized; the main roads are usable; and several social and micro-businesses support programs are in place. Moreover, the government is providing shelter to displaced families and has made significant progress in the plans for the relocation of the affected population into safer areas. The public investment program has been re-prioritized, and there is progress in the identification of official lending and grant financing. However, core public reconstruction activities have been slow to start mainly as a result of delays in the disbursement of financing already committed and capacity constraints. The government has developed a macroeconomic plan that is financially-sustainable and accommodates the large reconstruction expenditure, estimated at 65 percent of GDP. The broad parameters of this plan have been set out in the discussions leading to the disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) approved by the IMFâ€™s Executive Board in October 2015. Since then, the authorities have passed measures in line with their RCF commitments, and are finalizing the specification of measures committed under the RCF for FY2016/17; these are included in the budget proposal under discussion.
