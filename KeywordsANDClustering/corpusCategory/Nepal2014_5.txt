Background Excess liquidity has again built up rapidly, and is undermining the conduct of monetary policy. After a tightening of banks’ liquidity in late 2012/13, excess liquidity rose again in 2013/14, fueled by remittance inflows and accumulation of government balances in the financial system. This has again pushed interbank and t-bill interest rates to very low levels, and begun to affect retail interest rates. The NRB has attempted to reduce excess liquidity, with limited means and modest success. Over the course of the year, the NRB conducted reverse repo operations, using a total of Nrs 19.5 billion worth of treasury bills, out of its total stock of around Nrs 22 billion. This has succeeded in reducing excess liquidity from a peak of Nrs 70 billion in November 2013 (7 percent of total deposit) to around Nrs 40 billion in March 2014. However, nominal interest rates remain close to zero, as the liquidity overhang persists. The NRB has instituted bank credit policies designed to stimulate lending and economic activity. Regulations mandating minimum shares of lending to deprived and productive sectors aim to encourage banks to explore new investment opportunities, and a cap on the spread between lending and deposit rates is intended to force banks to improve efficiency. Staff Views Harnessing the financial sector and remittances to support economic development is challenging. While the goal of channeling remittance inflows to productive investment is appropriate, care needs to be taken to avoid unintended consequences, and preserve financial sector soundness. Excess liquidity, and its high volatility, is undermining monetary management, could adversely affect asset quality, and acts to increase lending spreads. More broadly, monetary policy cannot compensate for the lack of infrastructure and other structural impediments to growth (see below). Monetary policy should focus on controlling the volatility and level of excess liquidity in the banking system. This requires stepping up sterilization and/or raising required reserves, with appropriate consideration of cost sharing between the financial system and the budget. The NRB should more actively smooth short-term fluctuations in excess liquidity—partly Page 9 caused by uneven capital spending over the course of the year—through open market operations (OMOs), and aim to reduce its level (this can also include injections of liquidity). Key steps are: Government debt securities. Additional issuance of treasury bills and bonds to the NRB is needed to provide room for OMOs. This would also provide the opportunity to build a yield curve. Alternatively, the NRB could issue its own securities, but this may fragment an already shallow market. Strengthening institutional settings. Enhanced cooperation between the NRB and the Ministry of Finance in forecasting revenue and expenditure flows could improve liquidity forecasts. Separating monetary from debt management considerations in monetary policy and operational decisions would increase the focus and credibility of the NRB’s monetary policy. This could be supported by establishing a monetary policy committee at the NRB. An interest rate corridor would further strengthen monetary management, a step under consideration by the authorities. It would limit interest rate volatility, facilitate liquidity management, and improve monetary policy transmission. It could also help reduce the interest rate differential with India and incentives for capital flight, though at present this problem appears small. Box 3: Inflation Determinants Dependent variable: ∆ ln(CPI) Coeff/(SE) 0.12** (0.05) (0.019) (0.04) ∆ ln(CPI) t-1 ∆ ln(NEER t-1 ) ∆ ln(CPI_India) 0.37*** (0.06) 0.45*** (0.08) ∆ ln(Broad Money t-1 ) Determinants of Nepalese Inflation Indian inflation is the key driver of Nepali inflation. The currency peg and close trade relations with India suggest that Nepal effectively imports India’s inflation. However, other factors also play a role in generating inflation, albeit a relatively small one. Econometric estimates suggest that Indian inflation has the most significant impact on Nepali inflation, with a 1 percent increase in India’s inflation leading to a 0.45 percent increase in Nepali inflation. Inflation expectations also play a significant role. Changes in broad money have a limited impact: a 1 percent increase in broad money growth corresponds to only a 0.1 percent increase in inflation. The effect of the lagged NEER is small and not statistically significant.

While the impact on inflation would be modest (Box 3), there is some room for leaning against still-high inflation, thereby supporting competitiveness. Higher interest rates could also curb relatively cheap consumer credit, and with it, imports. Policies to direct lending and cap interest spreads are of limited effectiveness, and can have unintended effects. They may undermine asset quality by pushing lending to weakly supervised micro-finance institutions and largely unsupervised cooperatives, and Page 10 reduce quality standards for direct lending. In addition, a cap on spreads impedes longer-term lending and might discourage bank expansion into remote areas with higher operating costs and lower credit volumes than in urban areas. These effects run against the NRB’s goals to expand access to financial services, and promote lending to productive sectors. Against this background, these policies should be reviewed and modified, and eventually phased out. Promoting access to finance and investment lending could be achieved by other means (see below). Authorities’ Views The authorities saw a significant role for the NRB in promoting growth. In their view, excess reserves were a result of banks failing to seek out lending opportunities and actively contribute to economic development, and they did not want to reward such inactivity through remunerated reserves or debt issuance to mop up liquidity (the Ministry of Finance also had reservations about the interest cost of sterilization bonds). They also did not regard excess liquidity as a cause for concern, as it had not translated into excessive lending or higher inflation. Nonetheless, they indicated that they were considering introducing an interest rate corridor, as well as issuance of sterilization bonds. The authorities explained that demand for credit was high. Their directed lending and spread caps policies were meant to increase efficiency in financial intermediation by encouraging banks to lend to productive sectors that could contribute to development and job creation, while also encouraging savings. They were also of the view that the agricultural and hydroelectric power sectors had high growth potential but lacked financing, which necessitated NRB intervention. They also considered that enhancing supply by these sectors could reduce inflation. They pointed to prudential regulations on real estate lending and credit-to-deposit ratios that limited financial sector risk and would preclude an asset price bubble. However, they acknowledged that these policies could have unintended effects, such as hindering longer-term lending.
