Despite lower commodity prices and a weaker global environment, Mozambique’s economic prospects remain positive given planned massive investment in natural resources. While GDP growth averaged 7 percent over the last five years, Mozambique’s per-capita income ($624 in 2014) and human development index (178 out of 187 countries) remain low. There is a need to continue implementing policies that support fiscal sustainability, infrastructure investment, and inclusive growth. Over the medium term, efforts to develop a sound framework to manage natural resource wealth should be stepped up. Political tension remains a risk factor. Failure to find a permanent solution to the growing tension between the ruling Frelimo party and the main opposition party (Renamo), which is calling for greater political decentralization, could negatively affect the business environment. While the risk of a return to an outright civil war is low, the government’s attempt to disarm Renamo has resulted in violent clashes with the police. Peaceful negotiations are essential to preserve macroeconomic stability and investor confidence at a time when Mozambique is facing new economic challenges. Following policy slippages in 2014, the economy has been significantly affected by lower commodity prices and a decline in foreign exchange inflows. This has resulted in slower export growth, lower net international reserves (NIR), and a marked depreciation of the metical vis-à- vis the dollar. While the authorities tightened the fiscal stance and monetary policy following the 4 review under the PSI, renewed market pressures since the summer have led to a further depreciation of the metical (see para 7) and lower NIR. As a result, the authorities have requested a standby credit facility (SCF) to supplement the PSI to address the present balance of payments (BOP) need and shore up reserves, which will also provide a strong signal to markets of their intent to stabilize the economic and financial situation.
