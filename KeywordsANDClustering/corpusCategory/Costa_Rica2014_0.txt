Costa Rica bounced back quickly from the 2008–09 global crisis, but momentum is now slowing and macro vulnerabilities, mainly from the weak fiscal position, are rising. After falling modestly in 2009, real GDP surged in 2010–12. Since then, however, growth has moderated below potential, with the latter also on a declining trend. Hence, structural impediments must be removed to maintain sustained rates of economic expansion. The counter-cyclical budgetary stimulus imparted in 2009 pushed the deficit above 5 percent of GDP in 2010 (mainly through a rise in wages and transfers). The deficit has been creeping up further since then, placing the public-debt-to-GDP ratio on an unsustainable upward trajectory, which is fast approaching levels shown to increase risks of disorderly adjustment for emerging economies. A fairly inflexible XR has contributed to exacerbate vulnerabilities associated with dollarization in the financial sector, rendering even more important further improvements in regulation and supervision.
