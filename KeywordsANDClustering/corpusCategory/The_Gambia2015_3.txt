The Gambiaâ€™s near-term difficulties as well as its longer-term growth experience point to establishing and sustaining macroeconomic stability as a key imperative. The current conjuncture poses grave risks. With buffers severely eroded, immediate corrective actions are required to prevent the economic imbalance spiraling out of control. A forced adjustment would be very costly for The Gambia, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. A broad range of measures are needed to foster fiscal sustainability and improve the environment for private sector growth over the medium term. To this end, deep budget restructuring is urgently needed. Beyond that, reforms to lower energy costs, improve financial sector surveillance, and eliminate structural impediments to growth are also needed. The estimated size of the current account deficit under this alternative scenario indicates that the end-2015 exchange rate projected under the RCF baseline scenario would be overvalued by about 16 percent. With some overshooting, the exchange rate could depreciate by 20 percent initially, given the very low level of international reserves. At that level of exchange rate, the external public debt to GDP ratio would reach 69 percent of GDP at end-2015 but lower in NPV terms, and the external debt risk rating would remain moderate. The negative impact on tourism and remittances triggered by the global slowdown would be partly offset by lower commodity prices for imports of food and fuel. Page 16
