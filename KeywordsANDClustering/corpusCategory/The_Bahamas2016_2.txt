Prospects tempered by Baha Mar related uncertainties and low potential growth. Real GDP is expected to stabilize, with positive growth of about ½ percent this year, supported by continued growth in air tourist arrivals and moderating headwinds to private consumption and investment. Looking forward, staff projections assume that Baha Mar opening provides a boost to growth in 2018 and 2019, helping to close the still sizeable output gap. Structural impediments continue to constrain potential growth.

Financial Soundness Indicators 1/ (Domestic commercial banks) Page 11 over the medium term, down from close to 3 percent at the start of the century (see Box 2). The still negative output gap and remaining slack in the labor market suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are likely to remain muted over the next few years. VAT revenue is expected to support further fiscal consolidation and help stabilize central government debt over the medium-term, albeit at a higher level (at about 67 percent) than previously expected. Although the current account deficit is expected to narrow further, supported by low oil prices and an expected boost to tourism receipts, it remains elevated (at about 7 percent of GDP) over the medium term. Absent further foreign borrowing, international reserves are therefore likely to increase only gradually. Outlook subject to mainly downside risks . Setbacks in fiscal consolidation and a worsening of the macroeconomic outlook owing to a slowdown in advanced economies could heighten risks to macroeconomic stability and the country’s credit rating. Continued “de-risking” trends, including loss of correspondent banking relations (CBRs), could create an uncertain environment for businesses and have adverse implications for the financial services sector. Other key risks include a longer-than-expected delay in Baha Mar’s opening, U.S. dollar appreciation leading to a further weakening of cost competitiveness, natural disasters, and, over the medium term, the potential emergence of Cuba as a competitor for U.S. based tourists (see Table 6). On the upside, the Baha Mar creditor (through its appointed receivers) has an opportunity to promptly complete and open the resort. Past Fund advice . The last Article IV consultation was completed in June, 2015. The Executive Board called for (i) structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness, raise potential growth and lower unemployment; (ii) continued efforts to strengthen the fiscal position; (iii) efforts to further strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision; and (iv) policies that will address high NPLs. The authorities’ policies have been broadly in line with this advice, although implementation has been gradual. The authorities are moving ahead with finalizing the National Development Plan and have taken steps towards energy sector reform (para 11). Fiscal consolidation continues, although at a more gradual pace than previously envisaged (paras 9 and 13). Authorities continue to advance financial sector reforms (para 17 and box 3). Progress in addressing NPLs has been slow (para 12). cc illi oo & j j Page 12 Box 1. VAT Impact Consistent with international evidence of incomplete pass-through of tax increases to prices, VAT introduction in January 2015 likely had only a temporary and muted impact on consumer inflation, further dampened by still weak consumer demand and the concurrent decline in international oil prices. Reform. As part of the VAT reform, the authorities have eliminated the 10 percent hotel room tax, reduced import tariffs on a number of items, as well as adjusted several domestic tax rates including rates on property taxes, business licenses, and stamp duties. Overall, estimates suggest a significant net increase in tax revenue. Temporary, muted increase in headline inflation. While the tax reform has made an important contribution to maintaining macroeconomic stability and strengthening policy credibility, it is also expected to have temporarily increased inflation and, even with low estimated fiscal multipliers, to have dampened near-term economic activity. The VAT was introduced at a time when consumer demand was already relatively depressed, with a high unemployment rate and a large negative output gap, and coincided with a large decline in global oil prices. Both factors are likely to have dampened the impact of VAT introduction on prices. Estimates based on a simple forecasting model for inflation suggest that after controlling for other inflation determinants, VAT introduction increased annual CPI inflation in 2015 by about 2 percentage points, reflecting less than complete pass-through. The impact on inflation was also likely dampened by the simultaneous reduction in several import duties and excises. Impact on inflation sub-components. Monthly data on the retail price index and its subcomponents (relative to the average inflation in previous years) shows a temporary spike in headline inflation in January 2015. Headline and median inflation increased by about 2½ to 3½ percentage points in January. Pass-through appears to have been immediate and near-complete for sub-components such as food, beverages, furnishings and household equipment, health, communication and recreation (accounting for about 26 percent of the consumption goods included in the retail price index). Pass- through has been incomplete for other subcomponents, including the largest subcomponent of housing, utilities and energy (more than 30 percent of the total), as well education, restaurants and hotels and miscellaneous services. For some components, such as the tourism related restaurants and hotels, this reflects compensating factors in the tax reform, such as the reduction on the hotel room tax. For others, such as transportation, lower energy prices are likely to have dampened the impact on prices. The remaining differences in pass-through across items could reflect differences in price elasticities of consumption, competition, and the impact of regulated and administered prices. There is little evidence of “inflation smoothing”, i.e. increases in inflation in the months prior to actual VAT introduction, in headline inflation. ________________________________________________ 1/ The inflation forecast is based on a parsimonious model that relates headline inflation to the change in government debt and US inflation. VAT impact is approximated by the part that is not explained by underlying fundamentals. 2/ These results are broadly consistent with international evidence. For example, Benedek et al. (2015) show using European data that only about one third of VAT increases are directly passed through to consumer prices, with most of the increase taking place contemporaneously.

Potential Growth Staff analysis points to a significant decline in potential growth over the last 15 years. Furthermore, the large negative output gap is not expected to be closed before 2019. A comparison with other tourism intensive countries in the region generally shows similar trends. Methods. Potential growth and the output gap are not observable variables and estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. We therefore use three different approaches to estimate them. First, we use the multivariate filter approach developed by Blagrave et al. (2015). The structure of the filter relates the output gap to changes in inflation (i.e. the Philips curve) and slack in the labor market. This pragmatic approach can be easily applied to many countries, as it only requires data on three observable variables: real GDP, inflation and unemployment. Second, we estimate potential output using a conventional Cobb-Douglas production function approach with constant returns of scale. This approach also allows us to determine the different drivers of potential growth, i.e. factor accumulation (labor and capital) and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Finally, we benchmark our results against a simple univariate filter. Each of the three approaches have pros and cons. For example, while both the multivariate filter and production function approaches are based on economic theory, they also rely on several simplifying assumptions. In contrast, the univariate filter has no economic theory content, but is simple and widely used. Lower potential growth and a still sizeable output gap. Although there are differences in magnitudes, all three methods suggest that potential growth has declined significantly over the last 15 years. The decline started already in the late 1990’s, with potential growth hitting a low point in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC). Since then, potential growth has recovered modestly, with current estimates suggesting potential growth around ½ percent. Going forward, staff projections suggest a further recovery to about 1 to 1½ percent over the medium term. The results across all three methods also show a sizable negative output gap that has yet to be closed. Actual real GDP contracted by more than 6 percent in cumulative terms in 2008 and 2009, and as a result, the output gap turned sharply negative. Estimates suggest that the output gap is still negative, with an average of -2.5 percent across the three methods, and is not expected to close before ________________________________________________ 1/ See P. Blagrave, R. Garcia-Saltos, D. Laxton and F. Zhang (2015): “A Simple Multivariate Filter for Estimating Potential Output”, IMF Working Paper WP/15/79. 2/ We assume a labor share of 60 percent. The capital stock series is constructed using the perpetual inventory technique, assuming a depreciation rate of 6 percent (as in N. Thacker, S. Acevedo and R. Perrelli (2012): “Caribbean Growth in an International Perspective: The Role of Tourism and Size”, IMF Working Paper WP/12/235). V il H V il H il Page 14 Box 2. Potential Growth (Concluded) Decline in potential growth driven mostly by TFP. All factor inputs have contributed to the decline in potential growth. However, the deterioration in growth prospects has been driven mostly by more negative TFP growth, which has been about -1 percent of GDP on average since 2000. These results are similar to those obtained by Thacker et al. (2012), who also find that negative TFP growth has been a persistent feature in The Bahamas since the early 1980s. Furthermore, the large positive contribution of capital has been declining over time, despite temporary effects of large investment projects (for example, Baha Mar related investments boosted the capital contribution between 2011 and 2014). The contribution of labor also declined in the early 2000s, but has been improving modestly since then, in spite of considerable slack in the labor market. Cross country comparisons. Applying the same approaches to Barbados and Jamaica suggests that potential growth has declined also in these countries. However, the pre-crisis decline in potential growth started earlier and was larger in The Bahamas. Over the last few years, estimates suggest that potential growth has been recovering somewhat faster in Jamaica. All three countries are also still struggling to close the output gap, amid both relatively low actual and potential growth. ________________________________________________ 3/ TFP is measured as a residual. Thus, any measurement errors, changes in the quality of the capital and labor, as well as changes in capital utilization are attributed to TFP growth. Page 15
