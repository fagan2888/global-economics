The broad-based nature of economic growth has contributed to its resilience. Growth has been driven by services, construction and low-technology manufacturing (Figure 1); labor- intensive agriculture has lagged resulting in a persistently high unemployment and underemployment. In 2011 real growth declined to 6.4 percent partly because of significant power shortages caused by a slump in hydro generation. As the authorities quickly restored power supply by procuring thermal generation capacity from the private sector, growth recovered in 2012 and has remained at about 7 percent since then. Tanzania has experienced significant economic transformation since the 1990s. The share of agriculture in output declined from 32 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2012, giving way to higher value-added manufacturing and services. The decline in the share of agriculture in non- gold exports of goods and services was even more marked, from 49 percent to 13 percent over the same period. This diversification of the economy was facilitated by subsequent waves of reforms from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s aimed at reducing the role of the state in the economy, market liberalization, and policy modernization (Annex I). The pace of reforms, however, seems to have abated in recent years. Inflation has returned to the mid-single digits With the reversal of the 2011 surge in global food and fuel prices, headline inflation fell steadily from its peak of 20 percent in December 2011 to 5.6 percent in December 2013 (Figure 2). In January and February 2014, headline inflation picked up slightly to about 6 percent, in part reflecting a direct one-off impact of the near 40 percent average increase in power tariffs starting January 1 (see ¶13). Going forward, supply-side risks to inflation seem to be limited, in view of a strong harvest and stable global oil prices; the monetary stance is projected to contain demand pressures. A deliberate slowdown in the key monetary aggregates has contributed to gradual disinflation. Consistent with a tightening of reserve money targets, both broad money (M3) and private sector credit growth declined from more than 20 percent in 2010 and 2011 to 10 and 15 percent, respectively, by end-2013. Interbank, Treasury bill, and other key interest rates have not displayed clear trends (or provided clear guidance) in nominal terms over the past year or so, but they have risen substantially in real terms as inflation has declined. The disinflation has also benefitted from the broad stability of the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, which hovered within a narrow range during 2012 and depreciated by 3 percent between January 2013 and February 2014. Page 7 The current account deficit has been among the largest in the region for several years. It widened from about 9 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 2010/11 to 18 percent of GDP in 2011/12, owing to a significant surge in FDI, higher fuel prices, and one-off imports of thermal power generation equipment to offset the drought-induced drop in hydro power capacity. In 2012/13, the current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 14 percent of GDP as these shocks waned and weaker gold export receipts were more than offset by a reduction in imports of goods and services. The trade balance deteriorated again during the first half of 2013/14, driven by a decline in the price of gold and large demand for oil imports for power generation. Gross international reserves amounted to US$4.67 billion at end-December 2013, equivalent to almost 4 months of current year imports of goods and services for 2013/14. Current Account Balance, 2013 (percent of GDP) SSA median d g y e K C ‐ w l i p o d w i d u r u B i z i i h t The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 33 percent as of January 2014 from August 2011, when it reached its lowest level since 2000 . The appreciation stemmed from a positive inflation differential relative to trade partner countries. The central estimate obtained by staff using a variety of econometric approaches suggests that the shilling is somewhat overvalued, though these findings need to be interpreted with caution in light of the rapid transformation of the economy, including large current and prospective flows of FDI and possible large natural gas exports in the future (Annex II). Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates (December 2005 =100) NEER REER l u l u l u l u l u l u l u l u l u The authorities’ efforts to more fully capture repatriated profits by FDI companies in the income balance resulted in upward revisions to the current account deficits in 2011/12 and 2012/13, by 2 percent of GDP and 0.5 percent of GDP respectively. Page 8 Box 1. Response to the 2011 Article IV Consultation’s Key Recommendations Mobilize domestic resources . Tax revenues as a share of GDP are projected at 16.2 percent in 2013/14 compared with 15.2 percent in 2010/11, continuing an upward trend experienced for the past few years. The increase has stemmed primarily from strong growth, improved compliance, and tax measures in the 2013/14 budget. Going forward, reductions in tax exemptions are expected via the upcoming VAT reform. Reduce overall expenditure while safeguarding priority spending . The budget deficit was lower than programmed in 2011/12, but expenditure overruns led to a higher-than-programmed deficit and a breach of the net domestic financing performance criterion at end-June 2013. Expenditure pressures also pose a risk for executing the 2013/14 budget. Priority spending has been preserved. Improve public financial management . Domestic arrears have been a recurring issue. Stricter enforcement of spending commitment controls and better tracking of multi-year contractual obligations would be warranted. Enhance prioritization of public investment . The “Big Results Now” initiative has identified key strategic priorities. Further prioritization will be needed as this initiative is integrated into the budget process. Strengthen debt management processes . The debt management office is not yet operational. The Ministry of Finance published an updated Medium Term Debt Management Strategy in November 2013 (available at www.mof.go.tz). In monetary policy, be vigilant to the impact of rising food and energy prices . Following the 2011 Article IV Consultation, a major shock materialized, leading to higher inflation in the region. Monetary policy tightening and the unwinding of the shock have led to a gradual decline in inflation; the authorities’ medium term target of 5 percent is within reach. Follow up on the 2010 FSAP Update recommendations . See Section C. Fiscal pressures re-emerged in 2012/13 and 2013/14, leading to program slippages. Data yet to be finalized indicate that the deficit (measured from the financing side) in 2012/13 amounted to 6.8 percent of GDP compared to the 5.5 percent envisaged under the program. Domestic revenues turned out below expectations, by 0.7 percent of GDP, mostly owing to underperforming VAT. Domestically financed spending was 0.4 percent of GDP higher than envisaged under the program. As a result, the performance criterion on net domestic financing was breached by 1.2 percent of GDP. Meanwhile total public debt rose to 40.8 percent of GDP at end-June 2013. Optimistic revenue projections are posing challenges in the execution of the FY2013/14 budget . The budget approved by Parliament for 2013/14 envisages a 5 percent of GDP deficit, but assumes revenues (and expenditures) that are 1 percent of GDP higher than indicated in the May 2013 staff report (IMF Country Report No. 13/166). Updated projections The deficit target had been revised to 5.8 percent of GDP to permit a transfer to TANESCO, which was facilitated by an IDA budget support operation (First Power and Gas Sector DPO). While the World Bank disbursed the funds before the end of FY2012/13, the transfer to TANESCO occurred in early FY2013/14. Page 9 suggest a likely shortfall in total revenues by 2 percent of GDP compared with the budget, partly because of delays in introducing new taxes on SIM cards and bank transfers, lower gold prices, and weaker revenue buoyancy than previously assumed. Parliament in December replaced the SIM card tax with a further increase in excise duty on airtime by 2.5 percent. To achieve the original deficit target in the wake of revenue shortfalls, the authorities restricted spending for “other charges” in August, October and November, and introduced deeper spending cuts in the context of the mid-year budget review undertaken in mid-March. Weaknesses in public financial management undermine the quality and timeliness of fiscal data available to policymakers. The three main problems are: (i) recurrence of large domestic unpaid claims (with duration above 90 days); these increased to 1.6 percent of GDP at end-December 2013 from 0.5 percent of GDP in June 2012; (ii) growing expenditure “floats” (estimated at 6 percent of domestically financed spending or 1.3 percent of GDP in 2012/13); and considerable delay in coming close to reconciling the discrepancies between “above the line” deficit figures and the financing data. These issues point to weaknesses in budget formulation, execution and monitoring, including difficulties in aligning expenditures with available financing resources during the year. Additional firm and contingent obligations have built up in the pension system Firm obligations relate to the benefits of participants in the non contributory, pre-1999-reform system (Box 2). Contingent obligations stem from loans provided by several pension funds to finance activities by government entities, a practice that presents fiscal transparency challenges. Significant progress was achieved in addressing financial difficulties of the energy sector The independent energy regulator, EWURA, announced an electricity tariff increase by about 40 percent (on average) effective January 1, 2014. Analytical work done by the World Bank suggests that this is a significant step toward restoring the financial viability of TANESCO (the national power utility), and will substantially strengthen the company’s financial situation in 2014. To cover the losses for the current fiscal year and to clear the stock of the past arrears, TANESCO borrowed an amount equivalent to US$250 million commercially (with a sizable government guarantee) and received a direct budget transfer of about US$220 million (which was facilitated by budget financing from the World Bank and African Development Bank). TANESCO is also undertaking measures to improve collections and recovery of arrears and to minimize losses due to power theft. TANESCO’s financial situation is expected to further improve in 2015, with completion of a new natural gas pipeline and gas-fueled power plants leading to a decline in power generation costs. Realizing the benefits of the increased pipeline capacity will also require that the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation and the investors in the existing gas fields come to a final agreement on new gas supply contracts. The expenditure “float” measures payment orders that were issued in a given fiscal year, but were drawn from the banking system in the following fiscal year. Page 10 Box 2. Fiscal Obligations Stemming from the Pension System Prior to July 1999, the pension scheme for civil servants was non-contributory and pension benefits were all paid from the budget. The system was transformed to a contributory Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) in July 1999. During a five- year transition period (July 1999–June 2004), the budget paid all pension benefits. Although the government was expected to cover benefits associated with the pre-July 1999 scheme beyond the transition period, the PSPF has been paying retirees on behalf of the Government. Based on World Bank estimates, by December 2012, the government owed TSh 1.2 trillion (about 2 percent of GDP) to the PSPF. A 2010 actuarial valuation estimates the full pre- 1999 public sector liabilities at TSh 4 trillion (about 7 percent of GDP). In addition, the financial position of the PSPF is fragile, in part reflecting delayed reimbursements from the government. Ultimately, the central government is responsible for the pension obligations to civil servants. Further, the actuarial deficit arising from the broader pension sector, including several other public and private sector pensions also gives rise to substantial contingent liabilities. Credit to the private sector continues to expand in an environment of financial system stability. The rate of growth of credit to the private sector in nominal terms has declined compared with its peak in 2010, but remains strong at 15.3 percent y-o-y through December 2013, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP stood at 17.6 percent in 2013, having almost converged to the median share for a group of comparator countries selected on the basis of level of development and other characteristics (see chart below). Strong credit growth has not come at the expense of financial stability. In its March 2013 Financial Stability Report, the BoT concluded that the banking system remains well capitalized: the ratio of capital to total risk-weighted assets was 18.2 percent in December 2013 (December 2012: 17.5 percent; statutory minimum: 10 percent). Risks are receding: non- performing loans declined to 6.5 percent of total loans in December 2013 from 8.1 percent the previous year, though this remains above the regulators’ comfort level of 5 percent. To further mitigate risks, the BoT has increased the number of supervisors, enhanced banks’ framework for financial reporting, and implemented more updated stress-testing methodologies. Performance under the SCF arrangement has been mixed. All of the end-June quantitative performance criteria were met except for the ceiling on net domestic financing, breached by 1.2 percent of GDP. The indicative target on tax revenue collection was missed by 0.4 percent of GDP in June and September and by 0.8 percent of GDP in December. The end- December indicative target on reserve money was missed by a small margin (0.1 percent of GDP). The structural benchmark on the submission of the VAT reform bill to Parliament was further delayed from end-November to May 2014, to allow broader consultation with stakeholders. At the request of the authorities, the program was extended to April 30, 2014 (from its original expiration date of January 5, 2014). This allowed them sufficient time to implement measures envisaged under the program for completion of the third SCF review. The authorities are requesting a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on NDF at end-June 2013 on the basis that they have: (i) instituted revisions to the 2013/14 budget in the context of the mid-year budget review, including downward adjustments to the revenue projections and expenditure cuts of almost 2 percent of GDP to goods and services compared to the initial Page 11 2013/14 budget; (ii) obtained Cabinet approval for the main features of a reform to the VAT reform, which the government plans to submit to Parliament in May 2014; and (iii) as noted in ¶13, implemented increases in electricity tariffs on January 1, 2014 to improve the financial position of TANESCO and to reduce the need for the budget subsidies. The NDF target was met at end-December 2013.

Sources: Tanzania authorities, World Bank, IMF staff estimates. The macroeconomic outlook remains favorable. Economic growth is projected at about 7 percent in the medium term. Absent major external price shocks, inflation is expected to reach the authorities’ 5 percent target by mid-2014 provided that the BoT maintains its prudent monetary policy stance. Under the baseline assumption that the construction of a natural gas pipeline and gas-fired power plants is completed in 2014/15, the availability of cheaper energy would have a beneficial impact on economic growth and the current account. Nevertheless, with continued strong domestic demand and sizable foreign direct investment, the current account deficit is projected above 10 percent of GDP in the medium term. The economy faces several risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Table 6). Possible shocks to food and fuel prices would further weaken the current account, exert pressure on consumer prices and may necessitate additional social outlays. A sharp slowdown in China, on the other hand, would reduce prospective FDI and credit flows to Tanzania undermining key infrastructure investments and thereby future growth. This said, the most significant sources of risk relate to domestic policy implementation and include: potential fiscal slippages because of the intensification of pre-election spending; delays in the construction of the gas pipeline and the power plants; and the fiscal risks described below (see Box 4 in particular). Page 12 The long-term outlook will be influenced by the business climate and its impact on investment . There seems to be considerable room for improvement through structural and institutional reforms. In the 2013 survey of the World Bank Group’s ‘Doing Business’ indicators, Tanzania ranks 134 out of 185 countries (for the average across all indicators) and lags behind several of its peers in the region (including Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda). In particular, speeding up the resolution of commercial disputes and rendering tax policy more predictable are perceived as priorities by several entrepreneurs and financial market participants. In response, the authorities have set up a “BRN laboratory” focused on improving the business climate. East African Community (EAC) integration is progressing, although significant challenges remain. On November 30, 2013, the Heads of States of all five EAC countries signed a joint protocol outlining the process toward EAC Monetary Union, with the introduction of the common currency envisaged for 2024. Convergence criteria were agreed for inflation, foreign exchange reserves, and fiscal variables (Box 3). Implementation of the protocols for customs union (signed in 2005) and the common market (2010), including the elimination of remaining non-trade barriers, is crucial to reap the full benefits of monetary union. Box 3. Macroeconomic Convergence Criteria under the EAC Monetary Union Protocol The EAC single currency is expected to be introduced by 2024 by member states that comply with four primary convergence criteria, complemented by three non-binding, indicative convergence criteria that will serve as early warning indicators: Primary convergence criteria (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) Indicative criteria (i) (ii) (iii) ceiling on headline inflation of 8 percent fiscal deficit (including grants) ceiling of 3 percent of GDP ceiling on gross public debt of 50 percent of GDP in NPV terms reserve cover of 4.5 months of imports core inflation ceiling of 5 percent fiscal deficit (excluding grants) ceiling of 6 percent of GDP tax- to-GDP ratio of 25 percent
