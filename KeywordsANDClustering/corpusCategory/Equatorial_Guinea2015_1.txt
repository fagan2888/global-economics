The revised 2015 budget outlines the government’s response to the hydrocarbon revenue drop (Tables 3a–3c). The budget conservatively assumes an oil price of US$40 per barrel, and caps investment spending based on projected hydrocarbon revenues, resulting in the authorities’ targeted reduction of domestically-financed investment of 57 percent. The authorities’ strategy also includes measures to contain current spending and increase non-hydrocarbon revenues, notably by curbing tax evasion, eliminating widespread exemptions on customs duties, and exceptional revenue through the sale of state assets, mainly housing (Box 1). The medium-term fiscal framework targets a large further reduction in spending starting from 2018, as the infrastructure phase of their development plan concludes. Page 15 Box 1. Equatorial Guinea: Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy The government has prepared a draft of a medium-term fiscal framework. It aims to assess risks to fiscal sustainability and provide an eventual basis for medium-term budgeting anchored on a non-oil primary balance. Recognizing the need to strengthen fiscal management, the framework incorporates several fiscal measures adopted by decree in May 2014 and further enhanced under the revised 2015 budget. The mission’s baseline scenario applies broad elements of this strategy, but its assumptions vary on the profiles for revenue mobilization and expenditure consolidation. The revenue effort focuses on strengthening tax administration. A planned revision to the tax code is expected to include measures to: (i) reduce evasion of personal and corporate income taxes, particularly by large taxpayers ; (ii) tightening administration of ad-hoc customs duty exemptions, supported by African Development Bank program to computerize customs administration; and (iii) a pending tax amnesty law to resolve outstanding tax obligations and enhance compliance. Other measures include a review of subsidies to government agencies, audit and restructuring of loss-making public enterprises, introduction of rentals and other charges on public property, and sales of state assets. The authorities’ spending baseline includes sharply lower budgeted capital expenditure in 2015. Other near-term measures seek to curb current spending through lower personnel costs by reducing non-salary benefits and downsizing (ministerial posts were cut by half in early 2015), scaling back operating costs (reducing procurement, travel, and fuel allocations and introducing electrical metering in public buildings), and removing fuel subsidies to commercial users. However, current spending cuts are offset by a rising maintenance bill and higher social outlays under the second phase of the national development plan. From 2018, about 70 percent of savings are realized through cuts to capital spending, following a comprehensive review of the current Public Investment Program. The authorities’ consider that coverage of the tax base is weak. An ongoing enterprise census has registered over 1,900 businesses, as compared to 393 corporate tax filings in 2013. 2015-172018-20Authorities' revenue baseline5.46.5 incl. new measures7.49.6 Total additional revenue2.13.1Strengthening income tax collection 1.11.5Ad hoc duty exemptions0.51.0Amnesty law0.30.4Other (incl. export duties, rental income, asset sales)0.20.3 Authorities' expenditure baseline35.071.0incl. new measures35.140.1 Total change in spending (- = reduction)0.1-31.0Personnel-0.5-0.7Goods and services-0.3-5.9Maintenance0.70.7Subsidies and transfers excl. fuel0.60.0Fuel subsidies-0.2-0.7Investment expenditure-0.3-24.4 Sources: Equatorial Guinea authorities and IMF staff estimates Equatorial Guinea: Medium-term fiscal assumptions (2015-20) (percent of GDP, period average) Page 16 While the government is appropriately focusing its fiscal adjustment on reducing overly capital spending, the underlying strategy is subject to considerable risks. The envisaged adjustment in the 2015 revised budget is unlikely to be fully realized given the history of spending slippages due to weaknesses in public financial management (PFM), the late adoption of the revised budget, and the practicability of delaying politically-sensitive projects mid-stream. These risks are amplified under the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, which backloads a second round of cuts to investment spending, while relying heavily on tax efficiency gains and a tax amnesty program. For the latter, empirical evidence shows that while there may be short-run revenue gains, this type of measure often leads to weakening tax compliance. To highlight the risks posed by slow reform and delayed adjustment, a downside scenario shows higher spending moderately lifting growth in the short run, but lower medium-term growth due to weak prioritization. The slow fiscal adjustment contributes to a higher current account deficit and rapid depletion of buffers, as well as public debt rising to over 30 percent of GDP by 2020 (Text Table 2). This scenario is contingent on the availability of external financing, absent which there would be a buildup of arrears or need for an abrupt adjustment. Text Table 2. Equatorial Guinea: Baseline (Upfront Adjustment) vs. Downside Scenario, 2014–20 (Percent of GDP, unless otherwise specified) Staff recommended a consolidation strategy that aims to progressively reduce the non- resource primary balance to under 50 percent of GDP in the medium term. Staff’s baseline adjustment strategy applies current WEO oil price assumptions, and reflects relatively front-loaded cuts to public investment and stabilizing the government deposit buffer at about 7–8 percent of GDP, would involve a moderate increase in debt levels to around 17 percent of GDP in 2020 (Tables 1–5, Annex II). In line with this strategy, the mission made the following recommendations: Katherine Baer and Eric Le Borgne, 2008, “Tax Amnesties: Theory, Trends, and Some Alternatives,” IMF Occasional Paper, (Washington: International Monetary Fund). The non-resource fiscal balance and non-hydrocarbon GDP remove the impact of all hydrocarbon revenues and production (oil, condensates, and gas derivatives) from the economy-wide totals. 2014Prel.

The baseline framework assumes that front-loaded cuts should allow for the finalizing near- complete projects, scaling back ongoing projects, and reevaluating nascent projects based on fiscal sustainability and social impact. Urgent steps are needed to mitigate overspending risks, as staff analysis indicates that 2015 PIP aims to compress project execution from an average 40 percent per annum over 2008–13 to 7 percent in 2015, while bringing new projects on stream at nominal amounts (Text Table 3). Address fundamental PFM weakness. To better monitor and control capital spending, action plans were needed to bring budget classification and reporting on execution in line with CEMAC norms, and the National Payments Committee (NPC) should meet more frequently, preferably on monthly basis. Accelerating PFM reform is also a prerequisite for the move toward a formal fiscal rule that could anchor fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Shift the emphasis of spending away from infrastructure toward public services and social projects. Current spending remains low at 25 percent of total expenditure, compared to 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and 60 percent in the CEMAC region, with relatively low provisions for education and health. In line with World Bank recommendations, budget allocations need to be overhauled better respond to national development program priorities (notably in education and health) that are key to higher productivity and raise the return on infrastructure. Phase out remaining fuel subsidies to retail consumers and elaborate well-targeted programs to address the needs of vulnerable groups. Launch a multipronged effort to raise non-hydrocarbon revenues. The importance of non-hydrocarbon is highlighted by the fact that Equatorial Guinea is among the oil exporting countries in SSA with the lowest government revenue per barrel (Text Table 4). This may reflect an aim to attract investment through a competitive resource taxation regime. However, a deeper assessment is required World Bank, Equatorial Guinea Public Expenditure Review , January 2010 and June 2013.

Text Table 4. Government Hydrocarbon Revenue (As Percent of Hydrocarbon Exports) Page 18 to have a more definitive conclusion. In addition to planned measures to broaden the tax base, the authorities could consider a comprehensive review of tax policy and, in the context of the undergoing review of subsidies to public enterprises, consider wider introduction of user fees for government services (Text Table 5). The authorities reiterated their determination to achieve the targets under the revised budget. While acknowledging weaknesses in public financial management, they were confident that a strengthened NPC would impose discipline through strict cash management in line with the budget. Furthermore, although late adoption of the budget posed a risk, the authorities noted that key measures already began in 2014, further cushioned by the use of conservative hydrocarbon revenue assumptions. Over the medium term, the comprehensive review of the PIP would reduce investment possibly more quickly than programmed, freeing up resources for economic diversification, social development, and rebuilding of buffers. This process could be further anchored on a formal fiscal rule, toward which they would request IMF technical assistance. The authorities agreed that currently low oil prices offered a useful opportunity to progressively phase out fuel subsidies to consumers. However, they did not see merit in an urgent review of tax policy, noting that tax rates are near minimum thresholds set by CEMAC, and higher rates could undermine the push for diversification.
