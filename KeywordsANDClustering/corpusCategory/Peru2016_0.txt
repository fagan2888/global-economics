As a result of prudent macroeconomic management, Peru has successfully navigated the commodity cycle and the 2008–09 global financial crisis, and still leads growth among large Latin American countries. However, important challenges now loom as metal prices have dropped markedly since their 2011 peak, hurting exports, investment, and fiscal revenues. Like other emerging markets, Peru experienced capital outflows as global portfolios rebalanced and investment appetite dropped. The sol has depreciated 31 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar since its peak in January 2013, but only 3.8 percent in nominal effective terms over the same period, and Peru’s current account deficit widened. While supportive policies over the past three years have softened the adjustment, growth averaged about 2¾ percent over 2014–15 compared to 6 percent over the previous decade. Following the runoff in the presidential elections (June 5), a new government will assume office (July 28), providing an opportune time for setting a medium-term agenda that builds on past achievements to raise potential growth and further reduce poverty.
