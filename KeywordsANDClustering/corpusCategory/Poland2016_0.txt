Poland has enjoyed strong economic performance in recent years. Thanks to its sound policies, close links to the German supply chain, and substantial EU transfers, Poland was the only country in the EU that avoided an outright recession during the global financial crisis. Steady economic convergence has allowed Poland to close more than a quarter of its per-capita income gap with the EU during the past two decades (Figure 1). By any means, this is an important achievement. Figure 1. Poland: Income Convergence Poland has enjoyed strong economic performance... ...and convergence with the EU has continued. However, this strong performance has masked enduring regional disparities, which are undermining the quality of growth. Eastern regions in Poland—dominated by small-scale farming—have lower per-capita GDP, productivity, and educational attainment levels, while also exhibiting higher poverty and long-term unemployment rates. Despite strong overall economic growth, the east has not been catching up to the west (Figure 2). Going forward, Poland is also facing important long-term challenges as an aging population weighs on potential growth and public finances. With net emigration flows to the EU continuing and birth rates among the lowest in the EU, the working-age (15–64) population is set to shrink by more than 30 percent by 2060, resulting in almost a tripling of the old-age dependency ratio (Figure 3). If left unaddressed, these trends will ultimately reduce potential growth and increase healthcare and pension-related spending, weakening public finances.

Poland: Demographic Challenges Fertility is among the lowest in Europe,… ...and the population is rapidly aging. The new government’s priorities focus on strong and inclusive growth. The government, which took office in November, has approved a Responsible Development Plan, focusing on spurring growth through innovation and reducing social and regional disparities. The plan identifies five main pillars of economic policy to address long-term growth challenges: (i) reindustrialization—by promoting specializations where Poland could have a competitive advantage, supporting partnerships for strategic sectors, and attracting high-tech foreign direct investment (FDI); (ii) development of innovative firms—by improving the business environment, promoting start-ups, and enhancing cooperation between business and academia; (iii) mobilizing capital for development—by promoting domestic savings and better utilizing EU funds; (iv) foreign expansion by Polish companies abroad—by creating a strong Polish brand; and (v) social and regional development—by reversing unfavorable demographic trends, strengthening vocational education to match local market needs, and developing infrastructure in poorer regions. The government is working on specific measures to underpin the implementation of the program. Yet, some recent policy initiatives have dampened market confidence and could weaken growth going forward. In particular, the new tax on banks could undermine credit expansion, investment, and growth. Conversion of foreign currency mortgages into zloty is being considered, and depending on its design and implementation, could adversely impact financial stability. And though the new child benefits program is likely to reduce inequality and poverty, it will complicate the needed fiscal consolidation, and could discourage female labor force participation. Furthermore, efforts to reform key institutions have raised concerns. The Venice Commission has voiced its opinion that recent changes to the Constitutional Tribunal endanger the rule of law. These changes have also prompted the European Commission to initiate a dialogue within the Rule of Law Framework and have contributed to a rating downgrade by S&P in January and a downward revision of the outlook by Moody’s in May. In turn, financial market volatility has increased, foreign investor sentiment has soured, and spreads vis-à-vis German bunds have widened (Figure 12).
