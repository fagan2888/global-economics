Lower oil prices are eroding long-standing fiscal and external surpluses, but negative effects on economic activity in the UAE have been limited since mid-2014 (Figures 1-5). UAE has continued to benefit not only from its perceived safe haven status but also from its large fiscal and external buffers that have helped limit negative spillovers from lower oil prices, sluggish global growth, and volatility in emerging market economies. Strong growth in the Dubai services sector and expansionary fiscal policies in Abu Dhabi helped cushion the effect of lower oil prices on the broader economy in 2014. Macro-financial stability risks have increased since end-2013. Lower oil prices and the appreciation of the effective exchange rate are weighing on the macroeconomic outlook and credit risks and have led to a tightening of monetary and financial conditions. Large external buffers have continued to limit inward spillover risks. The buildup of liquidity buffers in the banking system has helped reduce market and liquidity risks. Against this backdrop, reforms to strengthen macro-financial stability and continue economic diversification are critical. Consistent with IMF staff advice, the authorities have been implementing a number of reforms aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities and strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework, including bolstering the GRE and banking sectors and strengthening fiscal policy coordination and economic statistics. The new context of lower oil prices and the prospective normalization of US monetary policy calls for resuming fiscal consolidation, strengthening macroprudential, regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and pursuing economic diversification. 2.
