The economy’s strong growth after the global financial crisis (GFC) has been supported by tailwinds: rising terms of trade (driven by high demand from China); and reconstruction activity after the 2010-11 Canterbury earthquakes. More recently, population growth driven by high net immigration also contributed, as the economy of Australia, New Zealand’s common labor market partner, has slowed. Growth peaked at 3.5 percent y/y in Q4 2014, bringing output slightly above potential. Due largely to the decline in oil prices, inflation has dropped to 0.1 percent (y/y) in Q4 2015. However, the tailwinds have recently waned. In 2014, dairy prices began to fall from historic highs, leading to a sharp drop in income growth after the positive effect of declining oil prices had worn off, and post-earthquake rebuilding activity in Canterbury has reached a plateau. Prices for whole milk powder (WMP), one of New Zealand’s key exports, declined from an average of around US$4,900/MT over 2013Q2-2014Q1 to US$1,700/MT in August 2015, partly on account of high inventories in China, decline in demand from Russia, and increased global milk supply after the European Union abolished its production quotas. Production cuts in New Zealand, which provides about 60 percent of global supply of WMP, have since supported a partial recovery of the price to just over US$2,300/MT in November 2015.

Canterbury Reconstruction Spending (Bn constant 2012 NZ$) Post-earthquake reconstruction investment in the Canterbury region ramped up quickly, from NZ$1½ billion in 2011 to NZ$4½ billion in 2014, but is forecast to plateau at about that level during 2015-17. Civil Commercial Residential As a result, output growth began to slow in H1 2015, despite resilient consumption. Meanwhile, unemployment has been edging up, reaching 6 percent in Q3 2015 (well above pre-GFC levels) even as employment is growing, on account of stronger labor force growth. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Source: Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. Monetary policy has been eased. With inflation below target and the weakening outlook, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) lowered its policy rate by a cumulative 100 bps since June Page 10 2015, to 2.5 percent, and has indicated its readiness to ease further if circumstances warrant in its December Monetary Policy Statement. Exchange Rates of Selected Commodity Exporters (US$ per national currency; Jan 2014=100) The exchange rate depreciation has cushioned some of the impact of the decline in dairy prices. The bilateral exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has depreciated as dairy prices fell and the RBNZ eased monetary policy. The depreciation has mitigated the impact of the international dairy price decline on farmers’ incomes, and supported exports of travel and education services. The trade-weighted exchange rate depreciated by 12 percent since its peak in July 2014, which has brought the REER closer to fundamentals, though some overvaluation likely remains (Annex I).

House prices in Auckland (where about one-third of the population lives) have continued their strong upward trend, rising by 22.5 percent (y/y) in December 2015, and the housing inventory available for sale remains low. Moreover, prices in neighboring areas are beginning to accelerate as buyers are priced out of the Auckland market. Supply shortages are a fundamental driver of house price inflation, exacerbated by high net immigration. On the demand side, macroprudential measures introduced in 2013 have led to a temporary slowdown in house price inflation. A package of additional macroprudential regulations and tax measures aimed at containing risks emanating from the Auckland housing market was announced in May 2015, but having become fully effective only in November, its effectiveness to cool rapid house price growth is yet to be seen (Box 1). Fiscal consolidation is broadly on track. With significant expenditure control and solid revenue growth, an overall surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP was reached in 2014/15, well above the budget target (which had envisaged a deficit). Net debt declined slightly to 7½ percent of GDP. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s policy advice in the last Article IV consultation. They have strengthened macroprudential policies to rein in risks from the housing market. Their flexible monetary policy has been supported by fiscal policy. GFS measure. The authorities’ measure of net debt excludes, among others, assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, which are projected to reach 12½ percent of GDP in 2015/16. Page 11 Box 1. Measures to Contain Auckland House Price Risks To contain risks arising from rapidly rising house prices to the financial sector, the RBNZ has used macroprudential policy tools proactively. First round (October 2013): The RBNZ placed a temporary ‘speed limit’ on high loan-to-value ratio (LVR) residential mortgage lending where banks must restrict new mortgages at LVRs over 80 percent to no more than 10 percent of their total residential mortgage lending. While house price inflation in Auckland initially moderated in response to the measures (and tighter monetary policy), it accelerated again during 2015. Second round (May 2015): The RBNZ announced additional measures, which have taken effect in November 2015: House Prices (Y/y % change) New Zealand Auckland area excl. Auckland area 2011 2012 2012 2012 2013 2013 2013 2014 2014 2014 2015 2015 2015 Sources: QV.co.nz and staff estimates. Residential property investors (though not owner-occupiers) in Auckland are required to have a deposit of at least 30 percent of the purchase price. The existing 10 percent speed limit for loans at LVRs of greater than 80 percent is retained in Auckland, while it is increased outside of Auckland from 10 to 15 percent, to reflect the more subdued housing market conditions there. A new asset class for loans to residential property investors has been established, which could attract a higher risk weighting than owner-occupier mortgages. Tax measures announced in the 2015/16 budget presented in May also complemented the RBNZ’s second round. They effectively apply income tax on profits from property sales for non-primary residences if the house is bought and sold within two years. The government also announced a tightening of reporting and taxation rules for foreign buyers.
