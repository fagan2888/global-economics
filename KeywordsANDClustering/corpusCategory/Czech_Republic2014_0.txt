The Czech economy has gained momentum, but policymakers still face challenges. Following a prolonged period of stagnation which was exacerbated by significant fiscal consolidation that went beyond what was necessary under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the economy has turned a corner, driven by strong external demand and a pickup in domestic demand. An easing of the fiscal stance is now envisaged, although the authorities’ fiscal policy agenda is yet to be clearly elaborated. With the policy rate at the zero lower bound, the central bank’s foreign exchange intervention policy has helped stem deflationary pressures but inflation remains well below target. A new pro-European, but ideologically-diverse, coalition government took office in January 2014. In contrast to the previous right-wing and euro-skeptic coalition, the new government—a coalition of the Social Democrats, a new center right party (ANO), and the Christian Democrats—is friendlier to the EU policy agenda. It already endorsed the Fiscal Compact and stated that euro adoption is a possibility before 2020, albeit not within its current mandate. However, the new government is ideologically diverse. Its overall orientation is toward more activist social welfare- enhancing policies, as evidenced by the decision to increase the minimum wage and introduce a lower VAT rate for some items, and the promise to resume full pension indexation (to a mix of inflation and wage growth). On the other hand, ANO has pledged not to increase taxes.
