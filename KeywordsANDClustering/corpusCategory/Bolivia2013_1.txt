Real GDP growth and the external position continued to be strong. The latest data suggest that real GDP growth accelerated to 6.6 percent by September 2013, from 5.2 percent in 2012, supported by soaring hydrocarbon exports, resilient private consumption, and accommodative macro policies. Staff expects output growth of 6.7 percent for the year as a whole, the highest growth rate in thirty years. Notwithstanding elevated export volumes, the external current account surplus is projected to narrow to 4 percent of GDP in 2013, from the peak of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2012, due to softer terms of trade and a pickup in imports. Sizable gross international reserves (projected at 49 percent of GDP at end-2013) continue to provide ample buffer against external shocks. Inflationary pressures resurfaced in the second half of 2013 triggered by food supply shocks. After hovering around 5 percent (y/y) in the first seven months of 2013, inflation increased in August and September driven by a spike in some food prices. By November, the food price shock reversed, with key staples posting deflation m/m aided by temporary measures to boost supply. However, core inflation (excluding food, fuel, and administered prices) edged up to 4.9 percent (y/y), from 4 percent in January. Staff projects headline inflation to rise to 7.5 percent by end-2013, from 4.5 percent in 2012. Monetary conditions were tightened in response to the inflation shock . Since end-2011, monetary policy has been anchored on a stable nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, supplemented by liquidity management through open market operations. Amid sizable excess Measures included increasing imports of those products and reaching agreement with domestic suppliers on their wholesale price. Bolivia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Page 6 liquidity, the central bank started a gradual tightening of monetary conditions at the end of 2012 and accelerated the pace of open market operations in response to the food inflation shock. The central bank also placed papers directly with pension funds and immobilized banks’ excess reserves in domestic currency (at a remunerated rate of 1.8 percent). As a result, excess liquidity fell and the auction rate of the 91 day t-bill inched up to 1.9 percent in November, from 0.35 percent at end- The authorities also applied stricter prudential limits on consumption credit and offered a savings bond to the public to stem the end-of-year seasonal hike in consumption. The overall fiscal balance is projected to stay in surplus in 2013, consistent with an expansionary fiscal stance. Fiscal outturns through October showed a strong overall performance, supported by robust hydrocarbon and tax revenues. Higher transfers and fuel subsidies partially offset the increase in revenue, while capital expenditure execution advanced at a faster pace than in previous years, as capacity at the subnational level continues to be enhanced with support from the ministry of planning. For 2013 as a whole, staff projects an overall fiscal surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP (1.8 percent of GDP in 2012), which would imply a pro-cyclical impulse of about 0.8 percent of GDP. Gross public debt is projected to decline to 32.5 percent of GDP by end-2013 and continue its downward trajectory over the medium term, with low risk of debt distress. The banking sector remains well capitalized. Growth in credit to the private sector moderated to 19 percent in nominal terms in November but remains high, led by commerce, real estate, and construction. Banks’ capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.9 percent in November, above the regulatory minimum of 10 percent, and the NPL ratio declined to 1.7 percent (from 8.7 percent at end-2006). Reflecting a new tax on foreign currency transactions and a corporate income tax surcharge for financial intermediaries, bank profitability is declining, with return-on-equity at 12.9 percent in November, compared to the peak of 21.2 percent in 2007. The steady increase in reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits and the stable exchange rate have contributed to a significant fall in the dollarization ratio (23 percent of total deposits in September from 53 percent in 2008). A new Financial Services Law could alter significantly the financial landscape. The law establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation of financial services, financial institutions, and financial groups. Although the law includes several good provisions, its general thrust is to subordinate financial sector activities to social objectives. Furthermore, by allocating broad powers to the Executive branch, the law may give rise to regulatory uncertainty. The yield of the 1-year t-bill increased to 4.08 percent in November 2013 from 0.75 percent at end-2012. The fiscal impulse is calculated as the change in the cyclically-adjusted non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance (Annex I). See accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis. Banking sector credit accounts for about ¾ of total credit to the private sector; the remaining ¼ is provided by cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions. Reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits are scheduled to steadily rise to 66.5 percent by 2016, from 21.5 percent in 2008. Page 7 Figure 1.

The law came into effect in November, but specific regulations will be defined by Supreme Decrees in coming months. Bolivia’s strong economic performance allowed the country to borrow from international capital markets at favorable terms. In October 2012, Bolivia tapped international capital markets for the first time since the 1920s, issuing a 10 year bond for US$0.5 billion at a yield of 4.875 percent. In August 2013, a second issuance followed also for US$0.5 billion at a yield of 6.25 percent. The issuances did not reflect a fiscal need but the authorities’ desire to establish a benchmark for corporate foreign borrowing and to pre-finance important public investment projects in anticipation of tighter external financial conditions. The authorities are advancing with the preparation of a medium term debt strategy.
