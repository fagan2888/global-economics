Niger’s risk of debt distress remains moderate (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Recently contracted loans, though concessional, have raised public debt levels from 25.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 41.9 percent of GDP in 2015, due in part to public investment in the natural resources sector and in infrastructure, and to the securitization of domestic arrears. In light of the DSA results, staff and the authorities concurred on the need to preserve debt sustainability . With limited fiscal space, the government is exploring options for public private partnership (PPP) investments as an alternative means to address infrastructure financing gaps. In this regard, staff noted the importance of strengthening the PPP framework, while continuing to strengthen the overall debt management framework by enhancing the capacity of the inter-ministerial committee on debt management. Staff urged the authorities to carefully assess the fiscal impact of the PPP contracts to ensure consistency with the external borrowing plan under the Debt Limits Policy, while reconsidering debt agreements signed but not yet become operational. Staff and the authorities agreed on the broader debt policy assessment and identified specific measures to strengthen debt management . The authorities agreed to suspend the conclusions of new PPP until the PPP framework is fully reviewed. To that end, they have requested FAD Technical Assistance. A mission is expected in early 2017 to help design a new framework based on an assessment of current risks. In updating the recent external borrowing plan prepared with the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department and the World Bank support (Table 11), the authorities are planning to restructure the debt portfolio by reconsidering pending conventions that are yet to become operational.
