Credit-to-GDP ratios (Percent) Discussions focused on policies aimed at preserving macroeconomic stability and enhancing resilience to shocks, while supporting higher long-term inclusive growth. In the near-term, with the output gap closed, the authoritiesâ€™ policy mix seems generally appropriate from an output stabilization perspective, but monetary policy, now mildly stimulatory, must stay vigilant of the possible emergence of inflationary and exchange rate pressures. At the same time, to build room to deal more effectively with shocks, it will be necessary to address persistent structural fiscal challenges, regarding both the insufficient revenue effort and inadequate expenditure management, to upgrade the monetary and XR framework, and to strengthen the financial system while setting the basis for its orderly deepening. Moreover, reducing poverty and stimulating long-term growth requires a boost to investment in physical and human capital to raise productivity, as well as institutional reform and improvements to the security situation.
