Tackling this challenge will require bold and comprehensive structural reforms, including in the labor market, to address low productivity and labor supply growth. Fiscal policy should balance consolidation needs against growth objectives to avoid derailing the fragile recovery. The macroprudential policy toolkit and regional cooperation on financial stability issues should be further strengthened to guard against future risks.
