RISKS Growth is improving gradually and inflation has declined. Real GDP expanded by about 5½ percent in 2013, underpinned by robust exports and FDI. Domestic activity remained subdued despite supportive countercyclical policies, reflecting in part headwinds from a weakened banking sector and slow progress in SOE reform. A negative output gap is estimated to have emerged (Box 2), and headline and core inflation have fallen, to 5 and 3½ percent, respectively, in mid-2014. The unemployment rate remains low, but underemployment exists, particularly in rural areas, and economy-wide wage growth was flat. Fiscal policy eased. The 2013 fiscal deficit is estimated at 5½ percent of GDP (GFS 2001), compared to 4¼ percent implied by the budget. Tax revenues fell short of the plan by about 1½ percentage points of GDP, mainly due to sluggish economic growth, tariff reductions, and new exemptions, while nontax revenues significantly outperformed in part due to increased dividend receipts from SOEs. Current spending was close to budget while capital expenditure was higher than planned. Monetary conditions remain accommodative. With inflation on a downward trajectory and growth below potential, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) reduced policy rates by 50 basis points in early 2014. Overnight interbank rates have been well below policy rates due to ample liquidity and the domestic government bond benchmark yield curve has declined. Sovereign spreads narrowed by about 100 basis points early this year, but gave back some of those gains following regional geopolitical tensions in May. The official exchange rate was depreciated by one percent in mid-June. The current account remains in significant surplus and international reserves increased. Robust growth in exports, tourism, and private remittances led to a current account surplus of 5½ percent of GDP in 2013. The financial account saw large net inflows of FDI and loans. However, in mid-2013 these were balanced by large capital outflows associated with the unwinding of gold deposits at commercial banks and following the announcement of U.S. Federal Reserve tapering. As a result, the overall balance of payments saw only a small surplus in 2013. With continued robust exports, gross international reserves rose in early 2014, to above US$36 billion, 2½ months of prospective imports of goods and services. Bank credit to the private sector has been sluggish and profitability has weakened. Despite accommodative monetary conditions and strong deposit growth, private sector credit growth was 2¼ percent (s.a., ytd) in March 2014, reflecting weak demand and ongoing adjustment due to weakened balance sheets. The system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen to below GFS 2001 presentation is different from the authorities’ presentation, mainly reflecting the inclusion of off-budget capital expenditure and the exclusion of principal repayments above the line.

Vietnam: Productivity, Technical Efficiency, and Potential GDP Total factor productivity (TFP) calculations using data from the national accounts show that the contribution of TFP to growth in Vietnam has declined in the last decade. Capital’s contribution increased, but by less than TFPs’ decline, and consequently growth slowed. Production function frontier analysis confirms this finding. A production function frontier represents the optimal output that can be achieved given a set of inputs. The basic stochastic production frontier can be characterized in the Cobb-Douglas form with a “composed error term” as follows: where (cid:1877) (cid:3047) is real GDP, (cid:1876) (cid:3041)(cid:3047) are capital and labor inputs, and (cid:1874) (cid:3047) is a traditional error component. The last term (cid:1873) (cid:3047) is a technical inefficiency component of the error term restricted to be non-negative ( (cid:1873) (cid:3047) (cid:3410)0(cid:4667) . Intuitively, Ln(cid:1877) (cid:3047) (cid:3404)(cid:2010) (cid:2868) (cid:3397) ∑ (cid:2010) (cid:3041) (cid:1864)(cid:1866)(cid:1876) (cid:3041)(cid:3047) (cid:3397)(cid:1874) (cid:3047) (cid:3398)(cid:1873) (cid:3047) (cid:3041) Real GDP growth and TFP -National Accounts (percent contribution to GDP growth) Capital Labor and Human Capital TFP TFP Linear (TFP) Sources: Vietnamese authorities; and IMF staff estimates Potential GDP Frontier vs. Actual Inefficiency gap (u, percent) RHS Actual (billion 2005 US$) LHS Frontier (billion 2005 US$) LHS it represents the gap between the frontier, which is the optimal output, and the actual output achieved, which is usually below the frontier given productive inefficiencies in the economy. The stochastic production function is estimated for Vietnam using maximum likelihood estimation and data from the Penn World Tables from 1970 to 2013. The estimated inefficiency parameter (cid:1873) (cid:3047) then Source: IMF staff estimates Headline inflation (LHS) Core inflation (LHS) Output Gap (percent of potential, RHS) Output Gap and Inflation (Year-on-year percent change) provides an index of how close or far the economy is from its most efficient frontier in each time period. The inefficiency gap varies over time but is shown to increase in the early 1990s, early 2000s and again from 2009 forward. This is consistent with the previous findings of a decline in the contribution of TFP to growth from 2009 forward. Potential output and the output gap can be calculated using this estimated production function. Following standard procedure, trend series for labor, capital and estimated inefficiency ( u ) are calculated using an HP filter. Based on this, potential growth is currently around 6 percent (below the 7 percent average of the last decade), and would remain close to that rate in coming years, assuming inputs, TFP, and inefficiency remain around current levels, consistent with the gradual reform scenario in staff’s baseline projection. A negative output gap opened after the global financial crisis, and widened to around 1½ percent of potential GDP in 2013. This output gap tracks well with recent inflation trends. ____________ For a discussion of stochastic frontier analysis see Subal C. Kumbhakar and C. A.

Page 10 90 percent from a peak of around 105 percent in 2011, helped partly by sales of NPLs to the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC). The official NPL ratio rose to 4.2 percent and capital adequacy is reported above the 9 percent regulatory minimum, but stricter loan classification and provisioning, and adjustments to account for multiple gearing and connected lending would likely cause both to show a significantly weaker situation. NPLs and sluggish credit growth resulted in weaker profitability, with the system-wide ROA and ROE in 2013 at 0.5 and 5.6 percent, respectively. Prices of real estate, a significant source of banks’ loan collateral, have yet to turn around after falling by about 50 percent from their peak. Growth is projected to continue its gradual recovery with subdued inflation. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes the authorities will maintain an expansionary policy stance to offset headwinds from slow banking and SOE reform implementation. For 2014, real GDP growth is projected at 5½ percent, inflation around 5¼ percent, the current account in surplus, and reserves around 2½ months of prospective goods and services imports. Over the medium term, growth is projected around 6 percent, reflecting a cyclical recovery of the domestic economy, with inflation remaining in single digits. A rebound in imports would return the current account to a deficit. The current fiscal stance would result in the accumulation of public sector debt to around 60 percent of GDP, slightly below the authorities’ legal limit of 65 percent. Under this scenario, domestic risks are tilted to the downside. Slow progress in banking reform raises the economy’s vulnerability to adverse shocks and heightened distress, the realization of which could result in negative macro-financial feedback, significantly undermining growth and adding to public-sector liabilities. Delays in fiscal consolidation would reduce fiscal space that may ultimately be required for banking and SOE reforms, and could pressure interest rates, crowd out growth-enhancing spending, erode public confidence, and ultimately undermine debt sustainability.

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. Page 11 The economy is also vulnerable to spillovers from external shocks. In the short-term, surges in global financial market volatility, higher global interest rates, or protracted regional geopolitical tensions could undermine confidence, and reduce international reserves absent greater exchange rate flexibility. In the medium-term, a high degree of openness and reliance on FDI make the economy vulnerable to slower growth in major trading partners. In particular, China is an important trade partner, main source of imports into the electronics and garments supply chain, and source of FDI and tourism (Figure 3). Early agreement on Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the European Union and Korea are upside opportunities that would secure access to main export markets and spur market-based reforms.

The authorities broadly concurred with the near-term macroeconomic outlook. To mitigate external risks they have reassured investors following recent geopolitical events, and reinforced the importance of structural reforms, trade diversification, and on-shoring of supply chains through TPP and other FTAs. They noted that the current account surplus, capital flows management, and the relatively small holdings of domestic assets by nonresidents limited the impact of global financial volatility on domestic markets. On domestic risks, they emphasized work was Page 12 underway on bank and SOE restructuring, with progress in line with their plans, and they viewed the risk of systemic distress as small. They considered the level of public debt as manageable, but recognized the risks of a further increase, and were looking to tighten fiscal policy gradually going forward.
