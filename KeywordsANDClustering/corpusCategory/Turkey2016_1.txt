The economy is broadly growing at potential but external imbalances keep accumulating . With the economy projected to grow at 3.8 percent in 2015, output and unemployment gaps are practically closed. The current account deficit (CAD) is improving on the back of better terms of trade. However, at about -50 percent of GDP, the net international investment position (NIIP) is large by international standards and deteriorating under the baseline. Moreover, given the high share of short-term debt, the countryâ€™s annual external financing needs are around 27 percent of GDP.
