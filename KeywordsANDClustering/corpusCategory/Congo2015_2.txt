The near- and medium-term outlook will be shaped by developments in the oil sector. Oil production is expected to decline in 2015 mainly due to the delay in the coming on stream of a new oil field. GDP growth in 2015 is projected at 1 percent and to average about 3 percent per annum during 2015–20. The lower international oil price is projected to lead to deterioration in the current account and continued pressure on the budget. This is expected to require the drawdown of government deposits at the BEAC of 6.5 percent of GDP in 2015. Over the period to 2018, the expected increase in oil production from new oil fields coming on stream should improve fiscal and external balances. From 2018, this trend reverses as oil production declines. Non-oil growth is projected to slow to about 3 percent in 2015–16, as public investment spending contracts and mining projects are delayed due to the uncertain global outlook for iron ore. Inflation is projected at 2½ percent over the medium term, underpinned by the pegged exchange rate regime. The path and quality of fiscal adjustment will play a key role. In two alternative scenarios, staff highlighted the implications of continued high government spending and improving public sector investment efficiency, respectively, on the medium-term economic outlook (Text Table): In a “downside” scenario with continued high spending, fiscal adjustment would be postponed by replacing declining oil revenues with external borrowing. Higher government spending compared to the baseline would provide a short-term boost to growth but increased inflation would erode competitiveness. Together with higher imports, this would lead to deteriorations in the current account deficit over the period 2016 to 2018. Moreover, in view of the projected decline in oil production and receipts from 2018, public debt would by 2019 exceed 60 percent of GDP, such that continued high spending would need to be financed by drawing down reserves. This would eventually trigger the need for a sharper fiscal adjustment in order to preserve reserves and buttress the exchange rate peg. The result in the medium to long term would be lower growth and a permanently deteriorated overall debt position. An “upside policy scenario” illustrates the implications of improving public sector investment efficiency. The increase in investment efficiency could be achieved by implementing the PEFA and PEMFAR recommendations and enhanced coordination between government agencies (see ¶30–31). In this scenario, increased investment efficiency leads to higher growth in all years relative to the baseline. Although higher growth slightly worsens the medium-term current account, owing to higher imports, in the medium term, the overall fiscal balance and reserves are higher than in the baseline. Page 18 Text Table. Republic of Congo: Comparison of Baseline and Alternative Scenarios Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex 3). Global risks relate to a prolonged period of low oil prices. In the absence of a clearly articulated medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, the accumulation of domestic expenditure arrears could accelerate and risks to debt sustainability increase. This could significantly undermine the resilience of the economy and the fiscal space that is essential to confront the challenges of economic diversification and poverty reduction. It could also give rise to tensions and instability. The upside risk to the baseline scenario relates to improvements in public sector investment efficiency. Authorities’ Views The authorities were more optimistic about non-oil growth. The authorities expect non-oil growth in 2015 to be buoyed by continued strong growth in the agriculture and industry sectors. The AAG are also expected to boost tourism, commerce, and services. The authorities expected household consumption to remain robust, supported by rising public sector wages. At the same time, they acknowledged that uncertainty from the oil price shock could impact consumer and investor sentiment. The spillover effects to the rest of the economy from the slowdown in spending in the construction sector are expected to be moderate, since large building projects are mostly undertaken by foreign companies that rely heavily on imports.

AveragesBaselineDownsideUpside(annual percentage change) Page 19 The authorities reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the medium term but noted the spending pressures related to the government’s diversification plans. They were closely monitoring oil price developments and recognized the need for improvements in the quality of government spending. The authorities emphasized that it is the government’s role to make the necessary investments in basic infrastructure and in education and health to facilitate growth and competitiveness and unlock private sector activity in non-oil sectors. The Special Economic Zones (SEZ) policy is also expected to permit the private non-oil sector to take off. Better roads will also help to establish Congo as a ‘transit country’ for cargo unloaded in Point Noire to be shipped across the region. These investments are expected to have significant returns in terms of boosting non-oil growth in the future.
