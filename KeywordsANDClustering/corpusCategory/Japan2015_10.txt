Taking last year’s trade developments into account, Japan’s external position and its real effective exchange rate in 2014 were assessed to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex IV). The assessment takes into account structural shifts (e.g., production offshoring) as well as temporary factors (e.g., impact of nuclear power shutdowns) affecting the trade balance. Subsequently, terms of trade effects and the REER depreciation suggest a strengthening of the external position under current policies. The reduction in the oil import bill has improved the trade balance and the REER depreciated by 7 percent through May 2015 relative to its 2014 average. This has moved the REER toward a moderately weaker level than would be consistent with its Current Account Goods Services Income CA balanceSources: Haver Analytics; and IMF staff projections.

The weakening of the yen has been beneficial, given the current stage of the economic cycle and the need to address low inflation and reduce deflation risks. However, sustained easing by the BoJ while others tighten, combined with the lack of bolder structural reforms and the absence of a credible and specific medium-term fiscal consolidation plan could strengthen the external position.
