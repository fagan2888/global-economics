The majority of end-December and end-March quantitative targets were met (Table 5). The adjusted ceiling on net domestic financing for end-December was not observed by about 0.3 percent of GDP. With a fixed bid system, a November bond issuance was oversubscribed more than two-fold; the authorities used the financing to compensate for lower revenues and meet larger than programmed capital spending needs. In contrast, the adjusted indicative target for the deficit at end-December was met, due to the high share of grants supporting externally-financed investment spending. An indicative floor for revenues was not observed by about 0.5 percent of GDP at both end-December and end-March (MEFP ¶15) due to factors mentioned in ¶3. Due to large across-the-board under execution of spending in the first quarter (pending decisions on recomposition of spending), the end-March indicative target on poverty-reducing spending was missed by a large margin. All end-January and end-March structural benchmarks were met (Table 6, MEFP ¶18). Among these were measures to strengthen expenditure approval processes in order to accelerate public investment spending; tax information sharing between Customs and Internal Revenue, which has already provided preliminary information to flag large importers who do not pay much in income taxes; updated financial projections for SOFITEX (state-owned cotton company) based on 2012 results; updated financial projections for SONABEL (state-owned electricity company) that helped identify needs in 2014; and a harmonized database for official gold production in 2012 and 2013, with strengthened ongoing cooperation between tax administration entities responsible for mining revenues.
