MEFP 10-11 The short term economic outlook is broadly favorable. Growth in 2014 is expected to be about 6 percent, only gradually rising to the longer-term growth rate of 7.5 percent in the medium term (Table 1, Figure 7). This reflects improved implementation of government projects and a rebound in agriculture because of favorable climatic conditions early in the year. Prospects in construction and real estate are also favorable, on account of strong demand for housing. The medium-term growth rate is consistent with labor and capital contributing about 5 percent to output growth and total factor productivity (TFP) growth contributing the remainder. Inflation is projected at about 3 percent by end year converging gradually to the authoritiesâ€™ target of 5 percent in the medium term. The main risks to the growth outlook arise from adverse weather conditions, lower than expected exports, slow project implementation, and volatile donor support . With agriculture still playing a key role in the economy, adverse weather conditions would result in weaker-than-expected agricultural output (see RAM). A protracted period of slower growth in advanced economies or a decline in commodity prices, particularly in minerals and traditional exports, would adversely affect exports. Delayed project implementation would also hinder growth prospects.
