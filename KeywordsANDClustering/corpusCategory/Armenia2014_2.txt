The Fund-supported program remains on track, with all end-June performance criteria and most indicative targets met. The fiscal targets, however, were met in a context of significant budget underexecution, and progress on structural reforms was mixed, partly reflecting the government change. As conditions have been weaker than expected, the programâ€™s fiscal deficit projections for 2015 and 2016 are being eased to support additional capital expenditures and GDP growth, although the fiscal path will still achieve the debt-reducing fiscal deficit target of 1.8 percent of GDP by the end of the program period. Projections for gross international reserves and the import-coverage ratio are also being revised.
