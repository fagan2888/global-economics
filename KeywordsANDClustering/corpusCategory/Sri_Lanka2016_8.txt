Revenue mobilization is envisioned as the linchpin of programmed fiscal adjustment, and would be achieved by base-broadening tax policy measures as well as reforms toward efficient, risk-based tax administration. These will be complemented by efforts to simplify the tax system. In line with recommendations made during successive technical assistance missions, the fiscal structural reform agenda includes the following elements: Tax policy measures (MEFP ¶7) . In light of low tax efficiency, the program seeks to broaden the base for income tax and VAT. To reduce income tax expenditures, the authorities will publish a statement of tax expenditures, i.e., catalogue and cost all existing tax exemptions, holidays, and special rates, and subsequently rationalize these tax expenditures, for example by limiting corporate tax incentives to expenditure-based ones tied to investment. This is also supported by introduction of a new income tax law with a view to simplifying and broad- basing the tax, supported by Fund TA. The income tax reform will be followed by base- broadening VAT reform including rationalizing VAT exemptions. Further, the authorities plan to streamline the trade tax regime. Tax administration reform (MEFP ¶8): There is ample scope to make tax administration more risk-based, supported by ongoing efforts to upgrade IT systems. In this regard, the program seeks to improve administrative efficiency of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) through adoption of risk-based compliance strategies for VAT and income tax as well as introduction of Key Performance Indicators on the number of risk-based VAT audit. The program also support timely roll out of the new IT systems for domestic tax and customs administration (RAMIS and ASYCUDA). Further, the authorities will pursue organizational and business procedure reform for the IRD, including creating a design and monitoring unit.
