The risks to the forecast continue to be tilted to the downside (Annex V). Upside risks include a return to very low energy prices that would have a favorable impact on production costs and purchasing power. An acceleration of reforms could also further support growth and competitiveness, as well as reduce vulnerabilities, and help to unleash the large unutilized potential of the economy. However, there are substantial downside risks. External demand could slow due to remaining economic uncertainties in the EU. A normalization of global monetary conditions could lead to higher costs for the large public and private financing needs. Border disruptions associated with the refugee crisis could hamper trade and tourism. Fiscal risks include delays in reforms, including of the public wage system and social benefits, as well as slower absorption of EU structural and investment funds. Furthermore, domestic political conditions remain challenging with possible adverse implications for the implementation of the NRP. In 2014, for instance, the inclusion of HBOR (Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development) into the general government added 4.4 percent of GDP to the public debt. Further widening of the general government debt coverage would likely be limited. Page 14
