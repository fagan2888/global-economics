emerged after South Sudan seceded, are bearing fruit and need to continue despite the difficult circumstances Sudan faces. The ongoing fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by monetary policy tightening to help rein in inflation and stem depreciation pressures. Adjustment of the official exchange rate to align it with market conditions should go a long way toward reducing external imbalances and enhancing the economy’s resilience to real shocks. Structural reforms are needed to help boost investment and growth over the medium term in the non-oil sectors, create jobs, and reduce poverty. Mitigating the impact of the macroeconomic adjustment on the poor should remain a priority. Sudan’s very high inflation rates have had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups and the poor. Expanding social safety nets will go a long way to protect the poor and build broader support for policies and reforms. In parallel, Sudan needs to continue efforts to secure progress toward debt relief by reaching out to its major creditors. Debt relief would unlock access to foreign financing, which would help support Sudan’s growth potential through infrastructure and social investment and FDI.
