Staff projects real GDP growth of 5.4 percent in 2014, above potential, supported by the hydrocarbon sector and a moderate fiscal impulse Commodity prices are likely to continue softening, but multi-year natural gas export contracts with Brazil and Argentina will maintain comfortable export volumes. The external current account surplus is expected to continue narrowing (to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2014 and 1 percent of GDP by 2018). The overall fiscal balance is projected to turn to a deficit in 2014 that would remain over the medium term as hydrocarbon revenues decline. Staff expects the authorities will succeed in anchoring inflation expectations and inflation will stabilize around 5 percent over the medium term. The issuances included collective action clauses. Staff estimates that potential growth in Bolivia is in the range of 4.5 to 5 percent (Annex II).

Page 9 Near and medium term external risks are somewhat higher than at the time of the 2012 Article IV consultation, but external financial buffers continue to be abundant. Downside external risks include: Weaker growth in Argentina and Brazil . The share of Argentina and Brazil in Bolivian exports has climbed to around 50 percent in 2013, from 25 percent in the early 2000’s. A slowdown in these countries would adversely affect Bolivia both through trade and non-trade (i.e. private sector confidence) channels. Empirical calculations by staff suggest that a one percentage point reduction in Brazil’s output growth would lower Bolivia’s output growth by 1/3 percentage point on impact and by close to 0.8 percent over a twelve month period (Annex III). Lower world commodity prices, particularly for hydrocarbons. Close to 90 percent of Bolivia’s exports are commodity based—with natural gas representing roughly 50 percent of total exports. Bolivia’s fiscal accounts are also sensitive to commodity prices, as hydrocarbon related revenues account for nearly 35 percent of total revenue and grants. An adverse shock to hydrocarbon commodity prices would affect revenues, public investment, and activity. Export price formulas for gas exports based on a basket of petroleum products with a three month lag provide a temporary cushion to a drop in commodity prices. Large buffers. Sizable international reserves and government deposits at the central bank— projected at 49 and 26 percent of GDP by end-2013, respectively—would allow the authorities to mitigate the effects of adverse external shocks, especially if these are transitory. Domestic risks are broadly balanced. On the downside, absent significant progress in finalizing key laws and improving the business climate, private investment may remain subdued. At the same time, the new Financial Services Law may not provide a level playing field for public and private banks and may weaken credit conditions and banks’ balance sheets. On the upside, fiscal stimulus may turn out stronger than anticipated in staff’s baseline scenario, in the context of the general election scheduled to take place in late 2014. In addition, the implementation of the National Public Investment System may result in a faster-than-envisaged removal of bottlenecks in investment planning, execution, and monitoring, particularly at the local level. The authorities were not too concerned about external risks. They stressed that Bolivia’s development strategy relies on domestic demand as the main engine of growth and noted that a slowdown in external demand would not have a major impact on economic activity, in particular since fiscal policy could have a more active role in a less benign external environment. The authorities also considered that staff estimates of spillovers overstated the effects that a slowdown in trading partners would have on Bolivia. The authorities emphasized that the large financial buffers would allow them to respond timely and effectively to any external shock. Page 10
