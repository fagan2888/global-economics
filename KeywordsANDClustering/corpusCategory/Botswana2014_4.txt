The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook, and prospects. They acknowledged the need to reduce the size of the government (as a share of GDP). In light of Botswana’s challenges, this year’s consultation focused on three main themes: (i) cost- efficient and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; (ii) preserving financial stability, while promoting financial inclusion; and (iii) raising economy-wide productivity growth to lift up potential growth over the medium term.
