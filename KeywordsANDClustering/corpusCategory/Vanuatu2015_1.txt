Outlook. Because of cyclone damage, tourism and agricultural output are expected to sustain a big drop in 2015. Reconstruction activity and commencement of several large infrastructure projects should provide a partial offset. On balance, real GDP is projected to decline by 2 percent this year, in contrast to the pre-cyclone forecast of about 3½ percent growth. In 2016, a recovery in tourism and agriculture combined with further ramping-up of infrastructure projects is expected to propel growth to 5 percent. Cyclone-induced shortages, reconstruction activity, and infrastructure projects are likely to raise inflation to about 2 percent in 2015, with a temporary suspension of VAT on construction materials, tools and seedlings and a decline in oil prices guarding against a more pronounced acceleration. Risks . The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, and risks are biased to the downside (Appendix IV). The timing of agriculture and tourism recovery is difficult to predict. It partly depends on the speed and size of insurance payments, which are still being assessed. Moreover, the scale and pace of reconstruction efforts may fall short of needs and expectations if external financing is not sufficient or because of constraints on implementation capacity. Further delays in infrastructure projects remain a possibility. From the external side, a larger-than-expected slowdown in major advanced or emerging economies or a persistent appreciation of the U.S. dollar would be a drag on Vanuatu, although their impact would likely be moderate given that Vanuatu’s export sectors are currently supply-constrained. Finally, the danger of new natural disasters remains ever-present. On the upside, the impact of post-cyclone monetary stimulus may prove larger than expected. . The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook. They emphasized that 2015 will be a challenging year. At the same time, they noted the resilience of the people and the economy. For a variety of reasons, including non-market production and the difference between gross output and value added, output losses in PDNA do not translate directly into the impact on GDP. The projected impact of the cyclone is broadly in line with Cabezon and others (forthcoming), Strengthening Macro-Fiscal Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change in the Small States of the Pacific, which relates GDP decline to the share of the population affected by a natural disaster. Insurance assessment is still ongoing. Insurance companies have reported 614 claims with an estimated total loss of US$101 million. The actual payout is expected to be considerably lower. Page 11 Box 1. Cyclone Pam and Economic Impact of Natural Disasters in Vanuatu Devastating category-5 Cyclone Pam made a direct hit on Vanuatu on March 13, 2015. With wind speed of up to 250 km per hour, it is one of the strongest storms ever and one of the worst natural disasters in the Pacific region. All of the country’s provinces were affected including the capital city of Port Vila, with the islands in the southern region struck particularly hard. Eleven fatalities were confirmed. According to the OCHA reports, 188,000 people were affected across the country (out of a total population of 265,000), including 60,000 school-age children. An estimated 65,000 residents were displaced from their homes and several thousands were sheltered in evacuation centers. Approximately 15,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed, including houses, schools, and medical facilities. Large-scale destruction of crops as well as agricultural infrastructure was reported, and the livelihoods of at least 80 percent of Vanuatu’s rural population were negatively impacted. With food and water supply compromised, the spread of disease was a threat, although the worst fears had not materialized. International humanitarian response was swift It included in-kind assistance and pledges of financial aid totaling US$50 million. Particularly large amounts of support were received from Australia (US$12 million), the United Kingdom (US$5.5 million), China (US$4.9 million), New Zealand (US$3.5 million), Netherlands (US$2.9 million), and the United States (US$2 million). The UN Central Emergency Response Fund has spent US$5 million through various agencies. The Asian Development Bank has provided US$1 million from its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. In addition, Vanuatu has received a payout of US$1.9 million under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot for the Pacific Islands. A preliminary Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) led by the government and assisted by development partners estimated the total damage and loss at 48.6 billion vatu, equivalent to 60.8 percent of GDP , of which 36.7 percentage points was attributed to damages and 24.2 percentage points to production losses (Table 1). The sector that sustained the most damages was housing, which accounted for 32 percent of the total damages, followed by tourism (20 percent), education (13 percent), and transportation (10 percent). The largest production losses were estimated in the agriculture and tourism sectors at 33 and 26 percent of total losses, respectively. The public sector accounted for 31 percent of the total damages and losses, while the remainder was borne by the private sector. Recovery needs, at 42.0 percent of GDP, are nearly equally split between the public and the private sector. Prepared by Nasha Ananchotikul.

The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot is a joint initiative between the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the World Bank, and the ADB. The pilot covers Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Page 12 Box 1. Cyclone Pam and Economic Impact of Natural Disasters in Vanuatu (Concluded) Vanuatu is the world’s most exposed country to natural disasters according to the World Risk Index which measures exposure to natural hazards and the capacity to cope with and adapt to these events. Sixty four percent of Vanuatu’s citizens are believed to be exposed to natural hazards every year. These include earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunamis, flooding, and tropical cyclones (Table 2). Relative to economic size, the average annual losses due to natural disasters in Vanuatu are estimated at around 6–7 percent of GDP, the highest among the PICs (Figure 1). Only a year ago Cyclone Lusi ripped through several provinces in Vanuatu and took 12 lives. With the estimated total damages and losses of over 60 percent of GDP, Cyclone Pam appears more destructive than any other event in Vanuatu’s recent history. It was also more catastrophic than Cyclone Evan, which cost Samoa roughly 30 percent of GDP in 2013.
