Estoniaâ€™s policies and policy agenda since the last Article IV consultation have been marked by continuity in policies (e.g. near-balanced budgets, steady implementation of their own policy agenda, the EU fiscal compact and the Basel III reforms (Box 2) ). With output near potential and signs of overheating in labor markets, the consultation focused on the appropriate fiscal stance and labor market policies, and on changes to fiscal and financial sector frameworks to help Estonia better manage within the constraints of the euro zone.
