Chile is confronting a changing external environment As the world’s leading copper exporter and with a large, internationally integrated financial sector, Chile profited greatly from recent years’ global copper boom and easy international financial conditions (Figure 1). Chile achieved a substantial increase in per capita income, a fall in poverty, and an improvement, if more modest, in its skewed income distribution. Growth tailwinds are now reversing as the Fed has started to normalize policy (“tapering”) and the commodity boom is petering out. Although Chile is in a strong position to cope with these changes and associated turbulence thanks to its freely floating currency, credible monetary policy framework, robust public finances, and a track-record of macro-financial stability, the changing environment poses challenges for macroeconomic policy and, in particular, for the prospects for strong and more inclusive growth. A new government has taken office Former President Michelle Bachelet won the November 2013 elections and assumed office on March 11, 2014 for a four year term. Her coalition also won majority in both chambers in Congress. President Bachelet was elected on a platform to improve equity through major tax and education reforms. The platform also includes energy, labor, and productivity reforms, and a clear commitment to prudent fiscal policy. Annex I summarizes past Fund advice.
