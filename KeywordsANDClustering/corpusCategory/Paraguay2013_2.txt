Discussions focused on policies and reforms to cement strong economic fundamentals and promote inclusive growth over the medium term . The authorities broadly agreed with the policy recommendations and pointed out that the Fund continued support through TA will remain critical to implement the reform agenda. A policy mix rebalance should take place in the near term . Fiscal policy is expected to be tightened in 2014 and 2015 to reflect the transition toward a more rigorous fiscal stance under the FRL. While the 2014 budget recently approved by Congress envisages a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP—higher than the 2.2 percent of GDP submitted by the government—staff estimates a lower deficit (1.8 percent of GDP) as a result of expected lower capital expenditure execution in line with past experience (60 percent of the budgeted amount), and a further reduction in the deficit (to 1 percent of GDP) in 2015, as the FRL takes effect. Thus, a fiscal withdrawal of close to 1 percent of GDP would take place in 2014 and 2015, which will also support some external rebalancing. Monetary policy settings have recently tightened, moving closer to neutral levels. The central bank stressed that it will continue to adjust the policy rate as necessary to keep inflation near the target rate of 5 percent.
