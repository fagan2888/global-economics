Real GDP growth is projected at 4 percent in 2015, with private consumption partially offsetting the negative contribution of external demand . The fiscal position of the consolidated public sector is projected to deteriorate to 2.7 percent of GDP, owing in part to increases in capital spending, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 42.6 percent of GDP. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 8 percent of GDP. Headline inflation is projected at 3.5 percent reflecting an increase in public and private spending toward the end of the year . The medium-term outlook remains broadly favorable . Staff expects a moderate acceleration in growth in 2016, owing to the projected recovery in foreign demand and an increase in election-related spending, which would result in a more expansionary fiscal policy. In the medium term, staff estimates potential growth at 4 percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 8½ percent of GDP as terms of trade are projected to deteriorate. To address large infrastructure and social needs, the government plans to step up spending by over 3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term. As a result, the public debt ratio is projected to stabilize at around 41 percent of GDP by 2020.

Page 14 Risks are, however, tilted to the downside . A potential deterioration in the financial conditions or levels of the Venezuela oil cooperation could increase pressures to absorb some quasi-fiscal spending into the budget. Also, the expansion of credit to the private sector, in the context of high dollarization, persistent dollar strength, and potential hikes in U.S. interest rates, could impose strain on dollar borrowers that do not generate dollar revenues. Structurally weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies and a persistent decline in prices of major export products would also have negative impacts on Nicaragua. A potential upside risk is the planned construction of the Gran Canal through Nicaragua . In 2013, a private Chinese investor was granted a 100-year license for building and operating a trans-oceanic canal with an estimated construction cost of US$50 billion (more than 4 times Nicaragua’s GDP). While such a large project could change Nicaragua's economic outlook, the limited information available on the financing, construction timetable, and its likely enclave features make the assessment of its overall impact difficult. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) finalized in June 2015 by a consulting firm hired by the investor has recommended additional studies, some of which are expected to be carried out during 2016. Moreover, in the context of a conference organized by Nicaragua’s National Academy of Science, a panel of international specialists concluded after reviewing the ESIA report that the information made available is insufficient to evaluate fully the net benefits of the canal and that several aspects of the project design would need to be revised before construction starts .

Nicaragua: Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework, 2013–20 Page 15 Relative likelihood High Source of risk Deterioration in the financial conditions or levels of Venezuela financing. Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions. High Nicaragua: Risk Assessment Matrix Overall level of concern (scale: high, medium, low) Impact if realized Policy advice Sustain fiscal discipline to keep the public debt ratio falling, and build buffers to face external and fiscal vulnerabilities. Bank credit to the private secto r needs to be monitored closely. High . Fifty percent of the oil-import bill returns to Nicaragua in the form of concessional loans used for social (off-budget) and for-profit projects. While the magnitude of the negative potential impact has diminished significantly with lower oil prices, the probability has increased given the deterioration of the Venezuelan economy. There will be increased pressures to absorb some projects into the budget. Low . The direct impact on non-FDI private capital flows would be modest given Nicaragua’s limited reliance on such financing. However, he expansion of credit to the private secto r, in the context of high dollarization, persistent dollar strength, and potential hikes in U.S. interest rates, could impose strain on dollar borrowers that do not generate dollar revenues. Increased volatility in energy prices. Medium High . Volatility in energy prices brings uncertainty about the fiscal cost of electricity subsidies, which are estimated at about 1¼ percent of GDP. There is scope for phasing out those subsidies which do not benefit the poorest households and introduce mechanisms that target the poor. High Structurally weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies (the “new mediocre”). High Protracted period of low growth in advanced and emerging economies would reduce growth in Nicaragua, particularly if growth in the U.S. is negatively affected. Lower- than-expected U.S. growth would lower export demand and remittances, in turn reducing activity and tax revenues in Nicaragua. Measures to improve the investment environment, promote competition, and strengthen the rule of law will be key to promoting robust and sustainable economic growth. A decline in non-oil commodity prices. Medium High Nicaragua's dependence on agricultural products would amplify the negative impact of unfavorable terms of trad e. The trade balance would worsen, slowing growth and negatively impacting public finances. Measures to improve export quality, particularly for its major export categories, food/live animals and miscellaneous manufactured articles. The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report (wh ich is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities. The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjec tive assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. Page 16
