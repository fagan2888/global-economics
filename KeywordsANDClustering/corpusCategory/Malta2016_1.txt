Economic performance remained robust. Real GDP expanded by 3.9 percent y/y in the first three quarters of 2016 following exceptional growth in 2014-15. Private consumption continued to benefit from favorable consumer sentiment, easy monetary conditions, and higher employment and incomes (Figure 1). Investment contracted after surging in 2015 due to large-scale infrastructure projects and developments in the aviation industry and, with the related decline in imports, the contribution of net exports to growth turned positive. High frequency indicators for 2016q4 point to a continued solid performance (Figure 2).

Labor market conditions continued to improve while inflation remained low. Solid employment growth brought the unemployment rate to a record-low level of 4.8 percent in 2016q3 from 5.2 percent at end-2015. HICP inflation eased to 0.8 percent y/y in 2016q4 from 1.4 percent in 2015q4, reflecting a moderation in the growth of non-energy goods and services’ prices. Expanding labor supply, resulting from higher labor participation and influx of foreign workers, kept wage pressures subdued and thus also contributed to the low inflation. Transaction-based Malta: Residential Property Prices (4-quarter moving average, 2008Q1=100) Rising demand has stimulated the property market in the face of limited supply. Residential property prices have showed a positive momentum, surpassing their pre-crisis peaks. The transaction-based price index increased by a cumulative 20 percent since 2011, while the advertised property price index increased in 2016q3 by about 30 percent in this period. Residential property prices are being boosted by buoyant mortgage lending, low interest rates, rising disposable incomes, and influx of foreign workers.

Advertised properties 2008Q1 2010Q1 2012Q1 2014Q1 2016Q1 Malta’s real GDP level was recently revised by about 5 percent due to incorporation of the 2014 Structural Business Statistics Survey, which indicates that the contribution of online gaming was higher than previously estimated. Staff expect an increase in imports and investment in 2016q4 due to a sizable transaction in the aviation industry. Consequently, the 2016 contribution of net exports to growth is projected to remain slightly negative. Page 11 have also stimulated demand. At the same time, construction activity—although improving— remained subdued, reflecting in part financing constraints and legacy NPLs. Credit growth remained weak and banks’ exposure to mortgages increased further. Mortgage lending continued to grow strongly at about 7½ percent y/y in 2016. However, overall credit growth to the private sector remained subdued as credit to non-financial corporate (NFC) sector continued to contract. The latter reflects tight lending conditions faced by SMEs as well as demand factors, including the deleveraging of highly indebted firms and the ongoing structural shift to less capital intensive services. With buoyant mortgage lending and further contraction of corporate credit, banks’ exposure to mortgages continued to increase.

Pockets of vulnerabilities, including from legacy NPLs and rising household debt, persist. Malta: Non-Performing Loans/1 (In percent of total loans) The NFC sector’s debt remains high at about 140 percent of GDP, though nearly half of it comprises inter-company loans, which are more stable and less prone to sudden reversals. Average profitability remained sound, yet SMEs in some segments are financially weak and vulnerable to shocks (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper (SIP)). The share of NPLs across the corporate sector declined recently, but remains elevated at about 13 percent, largely reflecting distressed legacy loans in construction and real estate activities. 2008Q1 2009Q2 2010Q3 2011Q4 Source: Central Bank of Malta. 1/The data source up to 2014Q4 is BR06 and thereafter from FINREP. 2013Q1 2014Q2 2015Q3 Total NPLs NPLs, Non-financial Corporates Households’ financial wealth is high (200 percent of GDP in 2015) and their default rate remained below 5 percent.

The 2015 fiscal deficit came in below the target of 1.6 percent of GDP and public Malta: Public Debt and Fiscal Balance (Percent of GDP) Fiscal Balance debt declined further. The 2015 fiscal deficit declined by 0.7 percentage points of GDP to 1.3 percent of GDP, which along with favorable debt dynamics lowered public debt to 60.8 percent of GDP from 64.3 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 3). Deficit reduction was largely driven by lower social benefits and higher revenue from IIP and excises. At the same time, the revenue buoyancy that resulted from better-than-expected economic conditions was almost entirely offset by spending overruns on public wages, higher-than- Sources: Eurostat; and IMF staff calculations. budgeted government co-financing of EU funds, and other temporary spending. Public Debt (LHS) The external position remained strong and the growth of unit labor costs (ULC) moderated (Figure 5) . The current account posted a surplus of nearly 7 percent of GDP during January- September 2016 as services receipts more than offset the deficits in the goods and income balances, while the NIIP remained stable at just above 50 percent of GDP. Strong labor productivity growth and weak wage pressures contributed to the moderation of ULC following a rapid increase in recent years. The overall external position is assessed to be in line with fundamentals (Box 1).

Malta’s government bond yields increased modestly at end-2016 in line with the steepening of euro-area yield curves, but remained low from historical perspective. After climbing by over 30 percent in 2015, Malta stock exchange index has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range, and registered a modest gain in 2016. A broad-based Index (FCI) developed by staff suggests that financial conditions remained supportive (see accompanying SIP).

Malta’s Competitiveness Developments Malta’s external position remains strong. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) remained broadly stable in recent years, registering a modest depreciation of about 1 percent between 2010 and 2015. However, the ULC-based REER appreciated modestly over this period following a continuous appreciation that took place since EU accession in 2004. The latter largely reflects a rapid increase in ULC due to a composition effect, namely the structural shift from the more labor productive manufacturing sector towards the less productive services sector. Despite the rise in aggregate ULC and the REER appreciation trend, Malta’s external balance has improved rapidly in recent years.

Exchange rate assessment (EBA-lite methodology) Current account approach CA- adjusted* CA-Norm CA-Gap Policy gap Residual REER-Gap (percent) The external position is broadly in line with fundamentals. This assessment is based on several indicators, including the EBA–lite current account norm estimates, misalignment estimates, and idiosyncratic factors. Given the high uncertainty surrounding the estimates, including the volatile balance of payments flows, a number of statistical adjustments were applied in line with the EBA-lite methodology. With these adjustments, the cyclically-adjusted current account norm shifts from 2.7 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP. The resulting gap (the difference between the adjusted current account and the adjusted norm) is 0.9 percentage point of GDP. This translates into a REER undervaluation of 1.1 percent. Contribution from policy gaps increases the current account surplus (mainly explained by Malta’s fiscal consolidation efforts). EBA-lite REER estimates suggest a small overvaluation of the REER of 0.5 percent. In a nutshell, staff assesses the external position as broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. (*) The cyclically-adjusted current account to GDP ratio in 2015 has been adjusted downward (to 1.9 percent of GDP) by a one-off factor which is equivalent to aligning the volatility of the overall current account with its trade or income balance counterparts (around 3.5 percentage points of GDP), broadly in line with Malta's 2015 Article IV report. The adjustment to the estimated cyclically-adjusted current account norm has taken into account the fact that a large share of private sector credit finances non-tradable activities (such as mortgages and residential real estates) and does not necessarily affect the trade balance.
