GDP growth has remained lackluster since last year’s staff report, as Chile’s economy continues to adjust to the end of the commodity super-cycle. GDP growth was 1.9 percent in 2014, well below the last decade average of 4¾ percent. The main force behind the slowdown has been the sharp fall in private investment. To a certain extent, a more modest growth path is the inevitable consequence of the end of the mining boom, which boosted investment and GDP growth to above potential rates in the last few years. Staff estimates that the 20 percent decline in copper prices from their average level in 2006–14 may subtract about 3 percentage points (pps) from Chile’s GDP growth, cumulatively over the next 5 to 10 years (see Selected Issue Paper, Chapter 1). Chile’s growth weakness also reflects the uncertainty and adjustment costs from the structural reform agenda launched in 2014 The decline in investment in 2014 also owes to a sharp fall in business confidence which cannot be fully reconciled with the stage of the business cycle and the external shock (Box 1), but may also reflect the reaction of Chile’s business community to the uncertainty associated with the ambitious structural and economic reform agenda announced by the new administration in 2014. This agenda rightly aims at fostering stronger and more inclusive long-term growth, including by addressing well- known gaps in Chile’s education system and infrastructure. To help finance spending in these areas, a reform of the tax system was approved in September 2014 which gradually increases capital income taxation. If well implemented, the reforms have the potential to boost productivity and GDP growth, but the higher cost of capital is likely to have a negative short-term impact on activity (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2). Moreover, the announced constitutional and labor market reforms appear to have increased private sector’s uncertainty over Chile’s future economic environment. In April 2015, the authorities announced that a dialogue over a constitutional reform w ould begin in September 2015, but no details w ere provided on the process. The labor marker reform was passed by the low er House in June 2015 and is currently under discussion at the Senate. 10141822-80-40040801201602002Q12006Q12010Q12014Q1 Copper price growth Real GDP growth (RHS)Source: Central Bank of Chile.

Jun-15 Page 11 Box 1. The Role of Domestic and External Factors in the Fall of Private Investment Investment fell by about 6 percent in 2014, owing to both external and domestic factors While there are no data on private fixed investment in the National Accounts, staff estimates that it fell by about 7 percent in 2014. The strong fall of copper prices (as of June 2015, down 35 percent from their 2011 peak) put an end to the investment boom that began right after the great financial crisis and caused mining investment to reach about 7 percent of GDP in 2012 (from about 2 percent in early 2000s). The strong real effective depreciation of the peso also hurt both mining and non-mining investment, as it made imported capital goods more expensive (in 2013, the value of capital goods imported was more than 60 percent of fixed investment in equipment and machinery). Domestically, the business confidence index fell by 17 percent in 2014, hitting its lowest level since the great financial crisis. Staff analysis (based on a VAR with GDP, copper prices, and business confidence indicators) suggests that the fall in business confidence in 2014 has been much more pronounced than what could be explained by the decline in copper prices and economic activity. An alternative explanation is that it might reflect the negative impact on business sentiment of the reform agenda announced at the beginning of 2014. Staff estimates suggest that external factors were the most important driver of the decline in private fixed investment . To assess the relative weight of external and domestic factors, we estimated equations for private investment in mining and non-mining sectors. The decline in private fixed investment in 2014 is largely explained by external factors. In particular, the depreciation of the peso and lower copper prices together account for about two-thirds of the decline in overall private fixed investment in 2014. Among domestic factors, an important variable behind the decline in mining investment was the increase in labor costs. Non-mining investment was also affected by the drop in business confidence and the fall in Tobin’s Q (proxied by the price-to-book value for listed companies) which may also reflect the higher cost of capital from the tax reform.
