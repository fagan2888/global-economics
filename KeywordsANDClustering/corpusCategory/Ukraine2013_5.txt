In discussion with authorities, staff highlighted the deep economic problems associated with the current policy mix and suggested an alternative. To maintain stability and revive growth, staff advised a decisive and comprehensive policy turnaround: (i) allow the exchange rate to adjust, eliminating overvaluation, and increase its flexibility; (ii) strengthen the financial system’s resilience to shocks, including by developing comprehensive contingency plans to cover potential capital and liquidity shortfalls under various scenarios; (iii) launch fiscal consolidation to support the external adjustment and reduce financing risks; (iv) raise energy tariffs as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce quasi-fiscal losses, and (v) persevere with deep structural reforms to improve the business climate and raise growth. Several of these recommendations were already discussed during the 2012 Article IV consultation (Box 2). The adjustment scenario outlined by staff would substantially reduce Ukraine’s vulnerabilities and help revive growth (Table 7 and Figure 8). The exchange rate adjustment would significantly improve the external position of Ukraine and help rebuild international reserves. Energy tariff increases and fiscal restraint would help raise public savings––the key thrust of the package––and make space for public investment in infrastructure. Reduced vulnerabilities, regained access to international capital markets, structural reforms, and higher international competitiveness would promote higher private savings and investment, including FDI. Overall, after an initial dip caused by the need to tighten policies to support the external adjustment and contain inflation (¶21), growth should recover, led by exports and investment. 201320142015201620172018Real GDP growth (percent)Baseline-0.31.01.51.51.51.5Adjustment-0.30.53.54.04.54.5CPI inflation (end of period) Baseline0.22.33.84.04.04.0Adjustment0.212.95.95.25.05.0Overall fiscal balance (including Naftogaz, percent of GDP)Baseline-7.7-6.6-6.3-8.0-7.7-7.6Adjustment-7.7-4.0-3.2-2.8-2.2-2.0Public and publicly guaranteed debt (end of period)Baseline41.344.748.053.457.560.2Adjustment41.341.540.739.737.834.6Current account balance (percent of GDP)Baseline-8.3-8.2-7.7-7.4-7.1-7.1Adjustment-8.3-5.0-4.1-3.8-3.8-3.6External debt (end of period)Baseline76.775.374.775.175.275.2Adjustment76.784.680.879.978.677.8Gross external financing requirements (USD billion)Baseline72.567.671.278.085.188.9Adjustment72.561.864.571.078.984.6Gross international reserves (percent of IMF composite measure)Baseline38.621.316.514.111.810.2 Adjustment38.650.562.181.2105.9137.5 Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and staff estimates. Projections Ukraine: Baseline and Adjustment Scenarios, 2013–18 Page 11 Box 2. Ukraine: 2012 Article IV Consultation: Key Recommendations and Actions Taken A year ago, Article IV discussion centered on policies to: (i) secure sound public finances; (ii) strengthen the finances of the energy sector; (iii) reduce financial vulnerabilities and revive lending; (iv) enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy; and (v) facilitate higher, sustainable medium-term growth. Progress in implementing staff’s advice in most of these areas has been slow. Fiscal recommendations. Meeting the 1.8 percent of GDP deficit target in 2012 required immediate adoption of measures to (i) raise tax rates and eliminate exemptions; (ii) remove special tax treatment of offshore tax havens; (iii) cut current spending; and (iv) apply strict limits on state guarantees. Progress: Some progress has been achieved in closing transfer pricing tax loopholes, amending the tax treaty with Cyprus to raise some taxes, and automating VAT refunds. However, the general government deficit reached 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012, and government guarantees exceeded 5 percent of GDP. Energy sector recommendations. Raise household gas and heating tariffs (mitigated by better- targeted social assistance) and articulate a broader energy sector reform strategy. Progress: The tariffs remained essentially unchanged, and energy reforms have been very slow to progress. Monetary/exchange rate recommendations. Increase exchange rate flexibility. Gradually unwind crisis-era policies, including Resolution 109 that forced banks to hold negative open foreign exchange positions. Progress: NBU continued defending the effective exchange rate peg, and the official exchange rate UAH/US$ remained fixed. Unwinding Resolution 109 was limited to a pilot project that allowed several banks to include government foreign exchange-linked bonds in the calculation of the net open foreign exchange position. Financial sector recommendations. Staff urged a review of contingency plans, strengthened monitoring, and creation of a dedicated financial stability unit, as well as close supervision of banks to ensure compliance with prudential norms. Progress: Reported financial stability indicators point to gradual strengthening of the financial system. With the help of IMF technical assistance, financial stability unit in the NBU has been created and become operational. Structural reform recommendations. Reforms to promote growth, improve the business climate, and attract investment, including global integration, deregulation, stronger governance, and privatization. Progress: Reforms allowed Ukraine to advance in the World Bank’s Doing Business international competitiveness ranking, but business people report that the business climate remains very challenging, as evidenced by declining domestic investments and FDI. Governance issues persist, particularly in public procurement and the opaque energy sector. Page 12 The authorities recognized the risks and agreed in principle that corrections to current policies are needed. They are currently elaborating policy adjustments in several areas. However, their assessment of the degree and speed of the necessary changes in monetary, fiscal, and energy policies differed from staff’s views. To minimize the reforms’ adjustment costs, the authorities preferred a gradual approach in the context of a comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment program, preferably supported by a financial arrangement with the Fund. They also saw the economic outlook more positively, emphasizing the positive impact of the good grain harvest on output and exports.
