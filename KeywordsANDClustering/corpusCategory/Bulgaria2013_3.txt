STABILITY Thanks to its robust policy framework, Bulgaria has successfully withstood recent challenges. Following tumultuous early transition years and the 1997 crisis, a period of stabilization began with the establishment of the currency board and supporting policies, including low fiscal deficits and debt, as well as conservative banking supervision. The robust macroeconomic framework was instrumental in supporting growth and EU membership before the global financial crisis (albeit with extraordinary inflows fueling a boom). Buffers built up during the pre-crisis period helped to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on growth, although unemployment increased sharply. Looking forward, the authorities recognize the need to safeguard stability while setting the conditions for accelerated growth and job creation. The authorities remain committed to the policies that are needed to support the currency board—which introduced policy predictability and controlled inflation—as the natural bridge to eventual euro adoption. At the same time, they recognize the need for broader reforms to set the conditions for higher growth, lower unemployment, and reduced incentives for migration.
