Staff expects the economic recovery to gather further momentum, with excess productive capacity narrowing slowly. Real GDP is projected to grow 2 percent in 2014 as investment and private consumption continue to improve on the back of more favorable financing conditions and a lower drag from deleveraging. Driven by a significant expansion in automobile production, exports are expected to expand further, but given their high import content and the expected surge in imported consumer and investment goods, the overall contribution to growth See: German-Central European Cluster Report, Country Report No. 13/263. 901001101201301401502007Q12008Q12009Q12010Q12011Q12012Q12013Q1 Hungary Poland Slovak Rep.

Average Hungary Page 10 from net external demand would be limited. At the same time, the current account is projected to remain in surplus this year. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around 1¾ percent. The impetus from domestic demand is expected to strengthen somewhat, and the contribution from net external demand is set to decline as import growth recovers. The latter together with slowing deleveraging and aging population dynamics would help normalize savings and turn the current account to a deficit, in line with its norm. Underlying inflationary pressures are expected to gradually build up, as spare capacity diminishes and the impact of one-off effects on prices wanes. Risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—are tilted to the downside. Staff noted that in an unchanged policy scenario, external vulnerabilities would pose risks to financial and economic stability in case of adverse external shocks. Uncertainty regarding advanced economies’ monetary policies or a further re-pricing of emerging markets or other risks could erode demand for Hungarian assets, spilling over through the banking (deleveraging) and balance sheet (exchange rate) channels. Moreover, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region would exacerbate downside risks through trade and financial linkages, including through exposure to common nonresident financial institutions and investors (Box 5). A protracted slowdown in key trading partners could also hurt Hungary’s recovery through its impact on exports. On the domestic front, continued government interference in the economy could exacerbate deleveraging with adverse confidence effects, undermine Hungary’s international competitiveness further, and hurt investment and growth. On the upside, the expansion of the FGS may temporarily boost growth further and so could upside surprises to euro-area growth. Authorities’ views While broadly agreeing with the near-term outlook, the authorities were more upbeat about Hungary’s medium-term prospects and the balance of risks. They agreed that, despite the recent improvement, external vulnerabilities remain high, and concurred that deterioration in the external environment would adversely influence Hungary through trade, financial, and confidence channels. To this end, they agreed that developments in Russia and Ukraine could affect Hungary; but they had not observed any immediate impact. The authorities viewed the risks to the outlook as broadly balanced and argued that the likelihood of capital outflows is low, particularly given that Hungary’s investor base has become more stable in recent years following the increase in the share 20122013201420152016201720182019Act.Est.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Proj.Real GDP Growth (percent)-1.71.12.01.71.71.71.71.7Inflation (period average, percent)5.71.70.93.03.03.03.03.0General government overall balance-2.0-2.2-2.9-2.9-2.9-2.8-2.8-2.7General government gross debt79.879.278.978.978.878.678.478.2Current account0.93.02.52.01.20.4-0.6-1.7Reserves (in billions of Euros) 33.933.834.635.536.637.638.839.9Gross external debt 1/128.8118.7116.8107.8100.294.289.987.1 Hungary: Key Macroeconomic Indicators, 2012-2019, (in percent of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) Sources: Hungarian authorities, and IMF staff projections.1/ Excluding special purpose entities.

They also argued that the economy’s improved fundamentals have instilled confidence in foreign investors as evidenced by the recent decline in the sovereign CDS spreads and the heavily-oversubscribed auctions of government paper. Finally, they were more upbeat about Hungary’s growth potential and also noted considerable upside risks to growth, including from a pickup in corporate lending and on the back of the stimulatory impact of the FGS; as well as from a stronger external environment.
