Negative effects from the drop in oil prices, weaker global outlook, and regional instability on growth in the UAE have been limited. Nonoil growth remained robust at 4.8 percent in 2014, driven by construction, notably owing to capital spending in Abu Dhabi, and services underpinned by continued strength in Dubai’s transportation and hospitality sectors. The Purchasing Manager’s Index as of end-June 2015 suggests that nonoil growth has slowed down recently, but remains in positive territory. Data on passengers and cargo at the Dubai International Airport as of end-April 2015 point to continued expansion. Hydrocarbon growth has also picked up to 4 percent, and oil production in the first five months of 2015 has continued to remain on elevated levels. Real estate prices have edged down since mid-2014, but rents are driving up inflation. House prices in Dubai have declined slightly (Box 1), reflecting strong supply and slowing demand stemming from lower oil prices, U.S. dollar appreciation, and structural measures such as the tightening of industry self-regulation, higher real estate fees, and tighter macroprudential regulation for mortgage lending. Following Dubai, house price growth has also started to decline in Abu Dhabi. With past increases in rents only feeding gradually into consumer prices, inflation increased to 4.3 percent year-on-year in May 2015, also reflecting upward adjustments of electricity and water tariffs in Abu Dhabi as well as higher costs of education and other services. Contributions to inflation have been negative from clothing and almost nil from food, reflecting the effects of the appreciating U.S. dollar. The current account surplus in 2014 narrowed due to falling oil prices, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated. The current account surplus declined but was still sizable (13.7 percent of GDP). Gross foreign inflows to the banking sector and foreign direct investment remained steady, reflecting the UAE’s perceived safe-haven status and its competitive business environment. Driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the REER appreciated by 3.3 percent in 2014, and by 9 percent in Q1 2015 compared to the average 2014 level. Following fiscal consolidation in 2013, the fiscal stance was expansionary in 2014. Based on preliminary 2014 data, the planned consolidation of 2 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP did not materialize because of higher-than-expected Abu Dhabi government spending, in particular on capital transfers. The fiscal stance was in fact expansionary with the adjusted nonhydrocarbon deficit increasing to 36.7 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP (from 35.4 percent in 2013), leading to an increase in the fiscal break-even oil price, to $78 from $69 in 2013. The overall fiscal surplus declined to 5 percent of GDP (from 10.4 percent in 2013). Page 11 Box 1. United Arab Emirates: Real Estate Developments The real estate market in the UAE has cooled down after expanding strongly in 2013 and the first half of 2014. By end-2014, sales price increases moderated in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and in March 2015, growth in residential sales prices turned slightly negative in both Emirates, in year-on-year terms (based on Reidin data). These developments are taking place amid increased supply, particularly in Dubai, and reduced demand associated with lower oil prices and appreciating US dollar, and following the introduction of mortgage regulations based on loan-to-value ratios and an increase in the property transfer fee in late 2013. With the additional new supply in the market, Dubai’s sales’ prices are expected to further decline over the course of the year, while constrained supply through 2017 will support prices in Abu Dhabi. The pace of rent increases, based on new contracts only, slowed in Q1 2015. The rent component in the CPI basket, based on both existing and new contracts, has been a major driver of inflation since September 2014. Price-to-rent ratios have declined since mid-2014 in both metropolitan areas, indicating a healthy correction in the UAE’s likely overpriced housing market. Correspondingly, gross rental yields have risen since mid-2014 (see charts below), registering a 6 percent year-on-year increase in March 2015. Other segments of the real estate market have also slowed down. The hotel market was buoyant in Dubai in 2014, supported by a large number of tourists, but the fall in oil prices and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar are expected to weigh on the performance of this market in 2015. Vacancy rates remain high in the office market (23 and 25 percent in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively), while new additions to supply this year are expected to put downward pressure on office rents in Dubai (based on JLL reports). Retail market rents rose rapidly in Dubai until mid-2014, but growth slowed down in late-2014. Forthcoming supply is expected to slow price growth further in 2015.

Page 12 Credit to the economy continued to recover with banks well capitalized and liquid, while stock markets declined following the oil price plunge. Lending to the private sector picked up to 11.5 percent year-on-year in December 2014 and to 3 percent year-to-April 2015. However, credit standards for firms were tightened in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015. Domestic deposit growth between 2013 and early 2014 was strong, boosting liquidity in the banking system, but slowed down towards end-2014 to reach 2.2 percent by April 2015 because of lower government and customer deposit inflows. Even though the capital adequacy ratio has slightly declined, banks remain amply capitalized. NPLs continued to decline from their post-crisis peak. The banking system remains profitable with a return on assets at 1.7 percent due to higher net interest margins, non-interest income, and operational efficiency. The sharp drop in oil prices last year has triggered a stock market correction and volatility—the stock market declined by 8.8 percent in April 2015 year-on-year (average for Abu Dhabi and Dubai). GREs have continued to strengthen their finances. In Dubai, the major debt restructurings from the 2008/9 crisis have been completed, several GREs made early repayments of upcoming maturities, and Dubai World agreed with its creditors to reschedule a large maturity due in 2018. With this, stronger financial positions and lengthened maturity profiles have further reduced debt- related risks. Nonetheless, total government and GRE debt in Dubai continues to be significant at 136 percent of Dubai GDP, and tighter global financial conditions could imply markedly higher financing costs for the GREs. In Abu Dhabi, GREs have substantially reduced their debt, and upcoming maturities in the medium term are significantly lower than the levels expected last year.
