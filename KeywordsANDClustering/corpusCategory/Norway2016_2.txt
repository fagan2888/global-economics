Economic policies should aim to mitigate the downturn while facilitating the transition and strengthening the economy’s productive capacity and resilience to shocks. Macroeconomic policies should work together to support growth and employment, while preparing the economy for a “new normal” by smoothing the transition to a less oil-dependent growth model. Labor market policies will play a key role in fostering external competitiveness and integrating refugees into productive employment. Also, further measures are needed to mitigate risks in the financial sector.
