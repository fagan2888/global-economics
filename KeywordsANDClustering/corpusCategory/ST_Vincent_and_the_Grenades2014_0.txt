Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen in 2014 . After a modest recovery that had brought growth to 2.4 percent in 2013, growth is estimated at 1.1 percent for 2014. Preliminary data point to an expansion of manufacturing and sectors directly supported by current government spending (health, education, public administration). Tourism has weakened and agriculture is estimated to have contracted owing to the floods and drought. The government’s limited capacity to implement flood-related reconstruction projects has pushed some capital expenditures into the future, constraining the public sector’s contribution to growth in 2014.

In February 2011, the IMF’s Executive Board approved a request from the authorities for emergency assistance under the RCF for SDR2.075 million (25 percent of quota) after Hurricane Tomas. In July 2011, the Board approved a request for emergency assistance under the RCF for SDR1.245 million (15 percent of quota), following torrential rains, flooding and landslides in April 2011 (IMF Country Report No. 14/360).

Risks to the GDP estimate are to the downside and hinge mainly on airport construction. These construction plans were heavily back-loaded into the fourth quarter (consistent with the phasing in 2012), but if it turns out fourth quarter construction fell short then growth could be considerably lower. Average inflation is estimated to have fallen to 0.2 percent (from 0.8 percent in 2013) despite the supply-side impact of the floods. The overall fiscal balance is estimated to have narrowed to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2014 on higher-than-anticipated revenues and under-execution of the capital budget. The revenue outperformance is due to improvements in tax collection and significant one-off revenues, such as increased import duty concessions for rebuilding. However, most of the deficit reduction is due to under-execution of the capital budget, apart from rebuilding houses for those most impacted by the floods (Text table). Capital spending is now estimated at EC$ 147 million compared to a budgeted EC$330 million (including a supplementary budget following the floods).

The authorities were able to roll over only about EC$21 million of a 10- year EC$30 million bond over the summer, and at shorter average maturities. The government’s accounts payable, including on VAT refunds, have continued to mount, although some of these arrears, such as subventions to statutory bodies, were expected to have been written off by the end of December. Nonetheless, by constraining cash flows for public and private enterprises, arrears may now be serving as a serious headwind to economic activity.

Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose to nearly 9 percent of total loans in 2014, Q2, although the ratio has been fairly low and stable for indigenous banks, it remains high for one foreign bank. Provisioning has declined from 34.8 percent of NPLs in 2013 to 27.2 percent in 2014 Q2. The tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 17.8 percent (2014 Q2), well above regulatory requirements, although this masks some variation, with one bank just marginally above the minimum.

Private sector bank credit growth fell to -0.4 percent, yoy over the first eight months of 2014, although it was partially offset by an expansion of consumer and small business lending by credit unions. There were no recent signs of a significant rise in credit costs and dollarization. The credit union sector, already with the highest rate of penetration in the ECCU (90.8 percent as of December 2013), is continuing to expand, benefiting from its income tax-free status and a reduction in lending by banks. As of January 2014, credit union assets had grown 5 percent yoy to EC$330 million, compared to EC$ 2122 in total bank assets at end- October 2014. The sector has been strengthened through consolidation, shrinking from eight institutions at the beginning of 2013 to four by end-2014. At the same time, there is some risk that as credit unions expand, they will gain market share primarily in higher-risk lending categories such as mortgages and loans to small businesses, although they try to manage their risks by keeping loan maturities relatively short. Credit to the private sector (Y-o-y percent growth) The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has closely monitored the non-bank financial sector and stabilized the Building and Loan Association (BLA) through active management of NPLs and recapitalization The recapitalization entailed the conversion of matured and delinquent redeemable shares into permanent shares and the purchase of additional permanent shares by existing shareholders, so that all costs were borne by shareholders. Moreover, deposit maturities were rescheduled to improve the liquidity situation of the BLA. In 2013, the BLA made a profit, albeit modest, for the first time in several years. It remains under the enhanced supervision of the FSA. In addition, the FSA has conducted onsite examinations of all credit unions over the last two years, which has led to re-capitalization plans for three of them and to a successful process of consolidation. The sector is fairly concentrated, with the largest credit union having a 54 percent market share. The Financial Services Authority took control of the Building and Loan Association (BLA) on February 1, 2013 due to runs on the BLA’s deposits following a media rumor about its imminent collapse. Page 10 Progress has been made to limit the adverse consequences of the failures of the insurance companies CLICO and BAICO on local savers, but negative spillovers persist . The third and final phase of the ECCU Policyholders’ Relief Program started in November 2013 and is expected to be concluded with the full receipt of funds committed by the government of Trinidad and Tobago. Despite the financial assistance provided by the ECCU governments, the magnitude of the shock on local wealth has been regarded as a significant cause of the slowdown of local private investment. The current account deficit is estimated to have declined slightly in 2014 to 29.4 percent of GDP, but remains high (Box 1). The decline is due primarily to a fall in imports given lower international food and fuel prices and lower than expected implementation of capital expenditure projects. FDI inflows have fallen in parallel, resulting in lower imports of construction materials. Box 1. Why is the Current Account Deficit So High? FDI Capital grants Current account deficit Current Account Deficit and Sources of Finance The current account deficit in St. Vincent has increased considerably since the early 2000s, averaging about 30 percent of GDP . However, most of the deficit is financed with non-debt creating flows that historically account for 90 percent of the deficit, notably foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital grants. The correlation between FDI and the current account is about 0.7, with low levels of FDI resulting in lower deficits as in 2000-01, and larger inflows of FDI fueling higher levels of imports and resulting in larger deficits. The construction of the new international airport has contributed to the larger deficits since 2008. Airport construction (see Box 3) has required large imports of construction materials and equipment, cumulating so far to some EC$100 million (2008 through October 2014), and accounting for about 1.5 percent of GDP over the last two years. Once the airport is complete, imports should decline accordingly, and the consequent expected boost to tourism and related industry exports should also help narrow the current account deficit over the medium term.

The ECCU Policyholders Relief Program was established by ECCU Governments to provide some financial assistance for individuals holding annuities issued by BAICO in exchange for the termination of their policies and the extinguishment of their relative rights. The first two phases, now completed, covered policies of EC$30,000 or less and cost EC$23.4 million (1.2 percent of GDP). The third phase compensates policy holders with balances over EC$ 30,000. Page 11 Box 1. Why is the Current Account Deficit So High? (Concluded) Distributed branch profits Reinvested Earnings Profit Transfers Abroad (Income on Equity) The increase in international oil prices until the recent swoon also played a role , contributing a third of the current account deficit since 2000, with the fuel import bill more than doubling from 2000 to 2013 to over 8 percent of GDP. The projected fuel price decline (to an average of about US$51 per barrel) will lower the current account deficit by about 1.6 percent of GDP in 2015. Repatriation of profits abroad has declined significantly since the onset of the global recession. Between 1993 and 2008 the return on FDI averaged 3.3 percent of GDP, but has since declined steadily to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013. This is a consequence of the lack of recovery in the tourism sector. However, with gradual recovery in the main tourism source markets (the US, the UK, and Canada) and the opening of the new airport, the return on FDI is expected to return to historical levels by 2019. _______ Between 2010 and 2012 a significant portion of the current account deficit was financed by government long term loans (in 2010) and other investments (in 2011-12). FDI in St. Vincent, compared to other countries, is lumpy relative to the size of the economy. The standard deviation of the FDI to GDP ratio in St. Vincent is 6.6, while the average in the world is 3.6, in other small states is 4.2 and in the ECCU is 5.4. Sources: ECCB; and IMF calculations.
