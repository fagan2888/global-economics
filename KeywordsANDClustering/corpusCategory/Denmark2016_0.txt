Denmark has a longstanding track-record of sound economic and social policies. It consistently scores high in international comparisons of the business climate and competitiveness, and education levels are high. In addition, the flexible labor market model and extensive active labor market policies have fostered comparatively high employment in recent decades. Meanwhile, income inequality is the lowest in the OECD (Box 1). But economic performance has been relatively weak for an extended period. Denmark has underperformed in recent decades, notably on account of low productivity growth that has lagged peers. Recently, a trend decline in oil and gas production has also started to weigh on output. Moreover, Denmark was hard hit by the 2008/09 global crisis, which coincided with the puncture of a local housing bubble. While a recovery initially took off, it was interrupted by renewed weakness in 2012â€“ 13, broadly following the growth pattern in the neighboring euro area to which the Danish economy is closely tied. A moderate recovery resumed from 2014.
