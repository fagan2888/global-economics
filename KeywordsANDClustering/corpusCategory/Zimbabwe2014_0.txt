The year 2013 was characterized by a protracted political season which reshaped the political landscape. After long negotiations, in January 2013 the main political parties reached agreement on a new constitution, leading to a constitutional referendum in March and to national elections in July. The elections gave President Mugabe a new term and his ZANU-PF party a super- majority in Parliament. This change prompted a major reshuffle of key policy-makers, with a new cabinet announced only in September 2013. The new government has expressed a commitment to the policies and reforms in the staff-monitored program (SMP), which had been initiated under the previous government. The new government has also unveiled a development blueprint for the next five years, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZIM ASSET, see ¶ 46 for further details). With the post-2009 rebound over, sustained growth and poverty reduction will require determined and comprehensive reforms. Economic stabilization under the multicurrency system and efforts at policy reform during the coalition government spurred vigorous growth, mainly in mining and services (see Figure 1). GDP growth averaged 10.5 percent during 2009-2012. The economy that emerged from the ashes of hyperinflation is quite different structurally from the one that preceded it (Figure 2). Over the past decade, little progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in improving gender equality (Figure 10). At 72 percent in 2011, the poverty rate remains unacceptably high (Figure 11). Formal employment has been shrinking, with an increasing fraction of the labor force in the informal economy. There has been little reduction in inequality, with the Gini coefficient at 0.42 in 2011. Adverse weather conditions, weak demand for key exports, and election-year uncertainty impacted economic activity during 2013. Real GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated to 3.3 percent (from 10.6 percent in 2012). Erratic rainfalls affected agriculture while manufacturing faced liquidity shortages and a weaker South African rand that undercut competitiveness. Although buoyant, mining activity has been affected by easing global commodity prices and domestic infrastructure challenges. Election-year uncertainty affected private investment and, at critical moments during the year, led to the tightening of liquidity conditions, which affected economic activity. Inflation has recently dipped into negative territory (-0.3 percent year-on-year in April 2014). Amid weak domestic demand, the appreciation of the US dollar against the South African rand (the currency of Zimbabwe’s main trading partner) contributed to an easing of the price level during 2013. The current account deficit deteriorated in 2013 (Figure 3), while reserves remain woefully inadequate. The deterioration reflects lower mining exports, as gold prices and diamond production both declined. Manufacturing exports have continued to shrink reflecting the sector’s declining competitiveness. The current account deficit was mostly financed by private capital inflows. Errors and omissions remain large, although they are on a declining path. The authorities and Fund Page 6 staff agree that those reflect under-recorded exports, remittances, and FDI inflows. Usable reserves remained below two weeks of imports at end-December (Table 1). Text Table 1. Zimbabwe: Government Domestic Payment Arrears On the spending side of the 2013 budget, the government had to accommodate large election-related spending (1.4 percent of GDP, mostly unbudgeted) and employment cost overruns (0.8 percent of GDP). The political process was funded by one-off revenue measures, cuts in other spending, and accumulation of new arrears to service providers. The government granted only one salary increase during the year. Nevertheless, promotion drift in the civil service and overspending on certain allowances resulted in employment costs exceeding budget levels (Figure 5). The silver lining was the higher-than-budgeted clearance of pre-2013 domestic arrears (Text Table 1). Revenues underperformed, and collections deteriorated markedly toward the end of Despite some measures taken to cover the costs of the political process, revenue came in lower than budgeted, with an exceptionally low Q4 performance (Figure 4). This was driven by general weakness in the economy and by a liquidity crunch in December, which probably hurt tax compliance. Corporate income tax, VAT, and customs performed particularly badly. Personal income tax and excises held up better, with the latter getting a boost from increases to fuel excises implemented in March 2013. Non-tax revenues were boosted by telecom license fees mobilized to finance the referendum and elections. The government was able to collect only US$18 million in diamond dividends in 2013, compared to a budget estimate of US$70 million. The fiscal year 2013 ended with an overall budget deficit (on a cash basis) of 2.2 percent of GDP. The government’s net issuance of domestic debt securities was equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP in 2013. To close the financing gap, particularly toward the end of the year, the government drew down its deposits in the banking sector, which fell by US$157 million (1.2 percent of GDP) in 2013. The 2014 budget is facing headwinds due to sluggish growth and large salary increases for the civil service. Weak revenue performance carried over into 2014, with the preliminary fiscal outturn for Q1 of 2014 showing total revenues 8 percent below budget projections. The agreement on salary increases reached between the government and its partners in the National Joint Negotiating Council in January 2014 is estimated to result in a 14 percent increase in the overall wage bill this year (assuming broadly unchanged numbers of civil servants), exceeding both budget projections and inflation. Excluding grant-aided institutions and pensions, the civil service wage bill is now projected to claim 53 percent of government expenditures in 2014, placing Zimbabwe at the top in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 6). 20122013 End-Dec. stocks Net flows End-Dec. stocks Goods and Service Providers 171-8091 Agricultural Input Suppliers 30-300 Capital Certificates 115667 Total 213-55158 Sources: MoFED and IMF staff estimates.(in millions of U.S. dollars) Page 7 Growth in bank deposits and credit slowed down in 2013, with liquidity conditions tightening around the middle and the end of the year (Figure 7). Banks experienced a liquidity crunch in June-August 2013, amid political and policy uncertainty related to the election and its immediate aftermath. There was also a sharp post-election drop in the stock exchange. A second liquidity crunch in November and December, related in part to withdrawals of year-end bonuses, was most pronounced in a few troubled banks. In early 2014, deposits are slowly returning to the banking system, but liquidity conditions remain tight. In March 2014 Afreximbank launched a US$100 million interbank facility (AFTRADES) to help the authorities address some of the liquidity challenges among solvent banks. Text Table 2. Zimbabwe: Selected Financial Sector Indicators, December 2013 The financial sector is marked by poor asset quality and low capitalization, with wide differentiation across banks (Text Table 2; Figure 8). Average non-performing loans (NPLs) rose from 13.8 percent at end-2012 to 15.9 percent at end-2013 (and to 16.6 percent in March 2014). The economic downturn and the impact of temporary measures introduced in March 2013 to reduce the cost of banking services further stressed average bank profitability. Capital adequacy ratios averaged 12.4 percent in March 2014, just over the 12 percent minimum requirement. However, there is large variation among banks in all these dimensions (Text Table 2). At end–December 2013, only 14 out of 21 operating financial institutions were compliant with the minimum capital There are several “troubled banks” on the RBZ’s watch list, jointly accounting for 15 percent of total banking sector assets and 10 percent of deposits at end-2013. The government’s maximum contingent exposure would be US$20 million over two years if this facility was used in full. In early 2013, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe (BAZ) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on a package of measures aimed at promoting savings and strengthening consumer protection, including caps on the fees for various services and floors on the rates paid on time deposits. Following a review of the operating environment and consultation with representatives of the BAZ, the RBZ decided not to renew the MOU, which expired at end-2013.

In January 2014, the authorities reaffirmed the current minimum capital requirement (US$25 million) and extended the deadline for meeting the US$100 million minimum from June 2014 to December 2020. With most banks unable to meet the June 2014 deadline, there was a risk of a gap in the regulatory framework, unless a more extended timeframe was adopted. By end-June 2014, all banks are required to submit recapitalization plans, including interim milestones toward meeting the new deadline. The authorities have reiterated their commitment to the multicurrency system, which is dominated by the US dollar in practice, and have recently added four new currencies as legal tender. They stressed that the regime will remain in place over the medium term (until at least 2018) to ensure macroeconomic stability. The authorities agreed that the full restoration of fiscal, financial, and external sustainability is a pre-requisite before any substantive changes to the exchange rate regime are considered. The record of implementing recommendations from the previous Article IV consultation is mixed. In concluding the 2012 consultation, Executive Directors urged strengthening fiscal management, improving the expenditure mix, increasing diamond sector transparency, containing financial sector vulnerabilities, and resuming payments to external creditors. The authorities’ 2013 budget was based on prudent revenue projections, including diamond dividends. However, revenue under-performed as growth decelerated at year’s end. Old domestic arrears were aggressively resolved in 2013, even as higher-than-budgeted expenditures contributed to the accumulation of new arrears. The wage bill continues to claim a disproportionate share of total spending, crowding out capital and social expenditures. Progress on structural reforms, including measures to increase diamond sector transparency, has been slow. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has intensified monitoring of troubled banks, but vulnerabilities persist. Since 2013, Zimbabwe has been making regular payments to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and to other IFIs.
