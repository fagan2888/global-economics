highly unsustainable (Annex 3). Staff’s DSA is based on the gross financing needs (GFN) framework, covering a period up to 2060. This framework captures better Greece’s true debt burden compared to a stock-of-debt framework, given that the bulk of Greece’s debt comprises official loans provided on highly concessional terms and with long maturities. Under staff’s baseline scenario, which assumes full implementation of reforms under Greece’s adjustment program, debt and GFN are projected to reach around 160 and 20 percent of GDP by 2030, respectively, but become explosive thereafter. The adverse dynamics are due to the need to replace gradually a large amount of concessional debt with market financing at much higher rates, which eventually render debt and GFN unsustainable. In other words, Greece cannot be expected to grow out of its debt problem, even with full implementation of reforms.

GFN (RHS) Debt Page 32 Greece thus requires significant debt relief from its European partners to ensure debt sustainability. While debt relief need not be approved upfront, all policy-contingent relief will need to be delivered once Greece’s official financing program ends, if Greece is to exit successfully from official financing. In this regard, the Eurogroup committed to provide further debt relief—in addition to the generous flow relief provided thus far—upon the successful implementation of Greece’s adjustment program in order to maintain GFN below 15 and 20 percent over the medium and long run. However, to provide more credibility to the debt strategy for Greece, further specificity will be needed regarding the type and scope of debt relief to be expected. In this regard, in addition to those measures that are sufficiently well specified by the Eurogroup, ambitious extensions of grace and maturity periods, a full deferral of interest on European loans, as well as a locking in of the interest rate on a significant amount of European loans will be needed to reduce GFN sufficiently to put debt on a sustained downward path. If Greece’s medium term objective (MTO) is also to be met over the long run, debt relief would need to be even more extensive (see Annex 3).
