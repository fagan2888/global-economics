Nigeria: Oil Exports by Destination Country, 2008 (Percent of total oil exports) Inward spillovers from the U.S. shale energy boom are sizeable. The rise in unconventional sources of energy such as shale gas and oil has led to a rapid increase in U.S. domestic energy production in recent years. Assuming the increase in unconventional energy production moves the United States to energy self-sufficiency in a 12-year period, the U.S. energy boom could lower energy prices, benefitting energy importers and hurting oil exporters like Nigeria that export about one-third of their oil production to the United States. Consistent with increasing shale production in the United States, Nigeria’s oil exports to the United States have declined significantly, as in other African oil-producing United States India Brazil Netherlands Italy Spain China United Kingdom South Africa France Australia Other Source: UN Comtrade Database.

Since July 2010, U.S. imports from Nigeria have decreased by about half, and competition in alternative oil markets has affected the premium on Bonny Light. (Percent of reporting country's GDP - average) Exports to Nigeria Imports from Nigeria Exports to and Imports from Nigeria by Reporting Country Trade links between Nigeria and a number of West African countries are important, but not substantial . In terms of exporting-country GDP, exports to Nigeria in 12 were most important for Benin (3.21 percent of GDP), Côte d’Ivoire (3.06 percent), and Togo (1.58 percent). Meanwhile, imports from Nigeria, measured in terms of importing-country GDP, were more sizeable, especial ly for Côte d’Ivoire (8.56 percent), Senegal (4.31 percent), and Niger (2.38 percent). At the same time, various studies point to important informal trade links, in particular in petroleum products and food cereals: Nigeria meets 70 percent of the cereal needs of Niger and Chad; its highly subsidized gasoline accounts for more than 80 percent of gasoline consumed in Benin.

The planned implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to facilitate trade integration Under the new trade regime, starting on January 1, 2015, 5 percent duty is applicable for 2,146 tariff lines under the basic raw materials and capital goods category; 10 percent for the 1,373 tariff lines that qualify as intermediate products category; and 20 percent duty is reserved for the 2,165 tariff lines that fall into the category of final consumer products. The CET will improve the transparency and coherence of the tariff structure of Nigeria, increase formal trade ties with the other ECOWAS countries, and reduce incentives for informal trade in the region. Cross-border activity of Nigerian-based banks with sub-Saharan countries is expanding . Since 2004, the number of subsidiaries of resident banks licensed in foreign jurisdictions increased from 3 in 2002 to 44 (operating in 21 sub-Saharan African countries outside Nigeria) at end-2010, to 67 at end-October 2013. After establishing a strong foothold in West Africa, Nigerian banks now appear to be looking to expand in the East. Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTBank), a leading Nigerian financial institution, acquired a 70 percent stake in Kenya’s Fina Bank Limited in 2013. This acquisition expanded the bank’s operations to three East African countries. Among Nigerian banks, United Bank of Africa has the widest footprint, with 21 subsidiaries as of end- October, 2013. However, its subsidiaries play only a small role in the host countries’ banking Page 10 systems. In at least 15 of the host countries, there is at least one Nigerian subsidiary that accounts for more than 10 percent of system-wide deposits or credit.

The 2009 Nigerian banking crisis did not lead to systemic contagion across the region. This is partly because the banks with the largest cross-border operations, accounting for more than half the foreign subsidiaries, were not among the troubled banks. Another factor that minimized systemic contagion was that the banking systems of the host countries are mainly funded by local deposits and therefore do not significantly depend on Nigerian funding. Systematic linkages between fluctuations in growth rates in Nigeria and neighboring countries are difficult to identify . Correlations between Nigerian GDP and that of neighboring countries are still generally weak: for example, IMF AFR REO October 2012 shows that after controlling for common global factors, shocks to Nigerian GDP have a negligible impact on GDP in neighboring countries. Authorities’ views . The authorities had a broadly similar view on the outlook and risks. There was agreement on the need to rebuild fiscal buffers to mitigate possible oil revenue shocks; but they acknowledged that achieving consensus with state and local governments (SLGs) on an appropriate level of buffers would be difficult, because the political environment seems less favorable ahead of elections. The authorities reiterated their commitment to stay the course on fiscal consolidation, as expressed in the 2014 2016 MTEF. Noting the changing dynamics in international oil markets, they pointed to the need to accelerate ongoing reforms in the oil and gas industry. On outward spillovers, the authorities see an urgent need to review the tariff structure, given the agreed implementation of the common external tariff in early January 2015. A GDP rebasing exercise is underway that could significantly increase the level of GDP (Appendix 2). The base year for the national accounts is being updated from 1990 to 2010, a period during which the structure of the economy has changed significantly for example, the share of agriculture in employment has fallen from 70 percent to about 30 percent. A material change in GDP would alter key performance indicators in the macroeconomic framework, including tax, investment spending, and debt ratios. For example, the tax revenue to GDP ratio of 20 percent puts Nigeria in the middle range of low-income countries, but a significant increase in GDP could push Nigeria in the low range of low-income countries. The authorities stressed the importance of credibility for the rebasing of the GDP; consequently the release of the revised GDP data has been delayed until after technical assistance missions from the Fund, World Bank, and African Development Bank, which started in mid-December. The authorities noted, however, that the expected higher nominal GDP would have little impact on their borrowing strategy, which is based on the ratio of debt service to revenue. Page 11
