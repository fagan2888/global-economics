In recent years the UK has enjoyed a robust economic recovery, led by private domestic demand. With the output gap now nearly closed, growth is projected to average near its potential rate over the medium term. Inflation, which is currently just above zero, is expected to rise slowly back to 2 percent as one-off deflationary effects from lower commodity prices and sterling appreciation gradually dissipate. The large current account deficit is also projected to narrow somewhat as returns on foreign investments revert closer to historical averages. However, this relatively benign baseline scenario is subject to large global and UK-specific risks. Page 10
