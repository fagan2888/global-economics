Stability? The financial system remains relatively sound. A Financial Stability Committee (FSC) needs to be established, with the BoI taking the lead role, and a new bank resolution framework should be legislated as soon as practicable. The financial system remains relatively resilient Israel’s banking system is domestically oriented, and its soundness is underpinned by strong and intrusive supervision (Tables 6-8). Banks have limited exposure to the global financial system and focus on traditional retail business, with limited engagement in investment banking activity. In the housing market, See Selected Issues Chapter II. See Selected Issues Chapter III. Page 14 historically low mortgage losses, a limited buy-to-let market, and open-ended personal liability, all curtail risks of major credit losses. Banks have gradually increased capital ratios, largely through retained earnings, consistent with the BoI’s new capital regulation which requires all banks to meet the core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9 percent by 2015. The capital ratios at the two largest banks must reach 10 percent by 2017 (under the Basel III capital definition). Banks’ core Tier 1 capital ratios range between 8½ and 9¾ percent, which is relatively low compared with many large banks in other advanced economies. However, this reflects the conservative use of risk weights. Moreover, Israeli banks’ leverage ratios (equity to capital ratios) are relatively high. Banks’ operations are fully deposit-funded, with the loan-to-deposit ratio well below 100 percent. In January 2013, the BoI strengthened liquidity regulations, requiring banks to adhere to new Basel III-type minimum liquidity coverage ratios, monitor net stable funding ratios, and strengthen the governance of liquidity management. Against this backdrop, the BoI’s recent stress tests suggest that even under severe global crisis scenarios―which assume an impact more severe than what Israel experienced during the 2008 crisis—all banks would be able to maintain a 6 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio. These results validate the broadly reassuring assessment provided by the 2012 FSAP Update. Under the most severe stress scenario, GDP is assumed to contract for four consecutive quarters (-4 percent growth annually), unemployment to rise to 12 percent, and house prices to fall a cumulative of 15 percent. Banks’ ROE would fall sharply from around 8 percent to -1 percent, but all banks would be able to maintain the capital ratio of above 6 percent.

Page 15 But tail risks to financial stability remain, and continuous efforts to further bolster the resilience of the system to shocks are imperative The concentration of loans continues to pose a risk to banks. Banks’ lending to mortgage markets and commercial real estate amounts to 40 percent of their total assets. To reduce concentration risks, the BoI has appropriately lowered regulatory exposure limits and has strengthened credit risk management. Nevertheless, stress-testing of banking sector exposures to large highly-leveraged corporates—in particular, holding companies and real estate and construction firms—should continue to be carried out periodically. If interest rates were to increase, households with floating-rate mortgages would be hit hard. The BoI’s stress test suggests that with a 20 percent drop in house prices and a sharp increase in unemployment, many mortgage borrowers, especially those with high DTI and LTV ratios and with floating-rate mortgages, would default on their loans. But overall, the impact on banks would be limited because of collateral and open-ended personal liabilities. However, a housing market shock could lead to a prolonged economic recession, which, taking into account adverse feedback effects, could indirectly hurt banks’ asset quality and profitability. It is therefore important that risk diagnoses and assessments from a macroprudential policy perspective are carried out on an ongoing basis, taking into account macro-financial feedback loops. The banking supervisor is considering introducing the Internal Ratings-Based approach, with a view to incentivizing banks to strengthen their risk management capacity. This is appropriate. Where risks are difficult to assess, regulatory floors should be set on risk weights or on loss given default estimates. Corporate lending by non-bank institutions (insurance, pension, and provident funds) has increased sharply in recent years (about 40 percent growth in 2012). Although the level of such lending is still low (less than 10 percent of bank loans), a sharp increase could give a cause for concern. The Goldschmidt Committee (which is currently reviewing regulatory standards for non- bank institutional lending activity) has recently made preliminary recommendations, including a tightening of corporate governance and a strengthening of transparency. As soon as the committee finalizes its report, regulations should be strengthened accordingly. In the insurance area, a Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors was signed recently. This will facilitate international cooperation and information exchange in insurance supervision. Progress needs to be expedited in addressing some key issues identified by the FSAP Update The authorities have instituted regular meetings of the three supervisory agencies―the BoI, the Capital Markets, Insurance, and Savings Division (CMISD) of the MoF, and Israel Securities See Annex V. Page 16 Authority (ISA) ―and the MoF, including to share information, harmonize regulatory practices, and analyze potential systemic risk factors. Consistent with the FSAP recommendations, the authorities are considering formalizing this practice by establishing a Financial Stability Committee(FSC). However, views differ on elements of the FSC’s mandate, governance structure, and organizational framework, including most importantly on whether the FSC should focus solely on macroprudential policies in normal times or also be in charge of crisis management, and who should chair such a committee (the Governor of the BoI, the Minister of Finance, or both as co-chairs). Staff discussed two options that are currently under consideration. Option 1 . The FSC will focus on macroprudential policies for normal times. The BoI would play the leading role, with the Governor serving as the Chairperson. The governance structure of the FSC would be carefully designed, with a view to ensuring its independence and effectiveness in carrying out its mandate (namely, information collection, risk identification, and decision making), while maintaining the autonomy of the financial regulators. The inclusion of non- executive committee members may also be considered. At the same time, consideration would be given to establishing a separate crisis management committee, focusing on crisis preparedness and management, with the MoF playing the leading role. Option 2 . The FSC shall have two functions, macroprudential policies in normal times and crisis management when necessary. The Minister of Finance would chair the FSC, although a compromise solution could involve both the Minister and the BoI Governor serving as co-chairs of the Committee. The decision making process would recognize the differences between normal times, where the BoI Governor would play the leading role, and crisis time operations, where the Minister of Finance would take the lead role. The membership of the committee could be expanded to include other important government agencies (such as the Prime Minister Office), but would exclude non-executive members, as the committee may need to share and deal with confidential information during crisis times. Staff favors the first option. There is clearly no one-size fit-all model for all countries. But as a general principle, to ensure the effectiveness of the FSC, institutional arrangements need to support a policymaker’s ability and willingness to act, by setting clear mandates, assuring operational independence, and requiring accountability and transparency. In this regard, Option 2 may risk undermining the effectiveness of the FSC’s macroprudential function in normal times, mainly because many government agencies (which may not have particular expertise in supervision) might be involved, political independence could be compromised, democratic accountability could be weakened by the exclusion of non-executive members, and because there is no easy way to clearly differentiate normal versus crisis times, thus creating governance and accountability problems. See Selected Issues Chapter IV. Page 17 Legal reforms to strengthen the BoI’s toolkit for early intervention and resolution, while clarifying the policy for emergency liquidity assistance and protecting the bank from quasi-fiscal activity, should proceed apace. Progress has been made in preparing a draft law with technical assistance from the Fund. All remaining issues need to be addressed expeditiously, with the aim of submission of the draft law to the Knesset as soon as practicable.
