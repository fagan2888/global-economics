Without corrective measures, the fiscal position would deteriorate substantially over the next five years . While the 2014 fiscal stance is projected to be broadly neutral, under unchanged policies the structural deficit is projected to worsen by as much as 3½ percent of GDP over 2015–2019. The deterioration would be driven broadly equally by the loss in e-VAT revenues and continued buoyant expenditure growth—which has outpaced that of revenue and GDP since 2009. Public debt could reach close to 40 percent of GDP by 2019, substantially higher than the new government’s target (Figure 5, Tables 3 and 4). Staff advocated a moderate but sustained consolidation effort for the next five years. An annual effort of around ½ percent of GDP in structural terms (excluding the effect of e-VAT losses) over 2015–2019 would stabilize debt below 30 percent of GDP—an explicit commitment of the coalition partners. It would also allow Luxembourg to return to its medium-term objective of ½ percent of GDP structural surplus by 2018—a European commitment—while mitigating the negative impact on growth (Figure 6, Table 5). The authorities have announced a VAT hike, as a first measure. The measure is expected to be adopted by Parliament in the second half of the year, with rate increases to take effect in January 2015, and an estimated yield of ¾ percent of GDP. Staff supported this move, noting that, given low current rates, the planned 2 percentage point hike would still allow Luxembourg to maintain the lowest VAT rate in the EU. The increase would apply to all rates but the lowest 3 percent rate on basic goods, helping to shield the poorest households. Based on the E-Business Directives, from 2015, VAT on digital content will be charged where the customer resides, not to the country of origin. 70 percent of the revenue (1½ percent of GDP) will be lost starting in 2015, an additional 15 percent in 2017, and the full amount in 2019. Page 12 Fiscal Adjustment Under Unchanged Policy and Consolidation Scenarios (In percent of GDP) Property taxes would be another preferred source of revenue . Luxembourg’s income from such taxes is currently less than 0.1 percent of GDP, while it averages ¾ percent of GDP in the euro area. Increasing the tax yield could take the form of an update in property valuations—which date back to 1941 and are out of line with current market prices. Raising revenue through this channel would also increase the holding costs of unused properties, potentially relieving pressures in the housing market. However, staff stressed that significant steps were also required to curtail rapid expenditure growth Staff welcomed the recently-initiated comprehensive expenditure review as a tool to prioritize savings to be included in the 2015 budget. As part of EU commitments, the planned introduction of multi-annual budgeting and expenditure ceilings for the central government could also help identify efficiency gains. A public sector reform bill which includes a wage agreement for 2014–16 is expected to generate short-term costs but will allow for a slowdown in the seniority system. Staff noted that, over the medium term, public sector staffing and compensation policies would need to be consistent with the new budgetary framework.

Page 13 Staff stressed that a specific area of focus should be social benefits, as they absorb about half of public spending, are the highest per capita in the region, and some of them create disincentives to work (Box 4). Consideration could also be given to partially means-testing family benefits. Pension reforms remain an unfinished agenda . Despite the steps taken in 2012, without deeper reforms, pension obligations are still expected to remain unsustainable in the long term. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider measures well ahead of the 2017 scheduled review, including by permanently limiting indexation of pensions to inflation only. The fiscal framework is to be adjusted to fulfill EU commitments and prepare for potential changes in international corporate taxation . A fiscal council to monitor deviations from fiscal targets is to be constituted. With the main fiscal target now defined in structural terms, staff underlined the importance of estimating output gaps conservatively, to avoid overstating the structural balance. The extent to which the global push for transparency in corporate taxation would affect revenues in Luxembourg is difficult to determine, as data is patchy; staff encouraged the authorities to develop a better capacity to assess tax revenues stemming from multinational activities. The authorities are keenly aware of the fiscal challenge, and plan to achieve consolidation mainly by slowing expenditure growth . They underscored that efforts had already started in 2014, with a limit on expenditure growth at the central government level, and that the VAT increase was also to come. They expressed a preference for front-loading measures in 2015, the year the revenue loss would materialize, stressed the role of the ongoing expenditure review, and took note of the recommendation on property taxes. They agreed that social benefits selectivity would need to increase—it is part of the coalition agreement—but noted, however, that reforms in that area might take longer to implement. While they recognized that more needed to be done to reform the pension system, they did not foresee any measures in the near term. The authorities also planned a strategic review of both tax and expenditure policies to provide the basis for reforms . On the revenue side, a committee of experts will be established to conduct a comprehensive review of the tax system, in particular with a view to improving efficiency while maintaining tax competitiveness. Measures would be expected in 2017. On the expenditure side, the authorities noted that a move to a more flexible system, whereby public servants could be moved from one area to another more easily, would help respond to evolving needs. With respect to international corporate taxation, the authorities reiterated that, as long as a level playing field was established at a global level, they would favor those reforms. Page 14 Box 4. Inactivity Traps in Luxembourg Incentives embedded in the social benefits system can give rise to “inactivity traps”. These operate when people taking up employment are financially worse off, because the additional net income from work is less than the social benefits foregone in the process, either from unemployment benefits and/or from other social assistance, deterring those affected from participating in economic activity. In those circumstances, the marginal effective tax rate (METR) exceeds 100 percent: more than 100 percent of the additional income is “taxed away”. These effects tend to be observed mostly at the low end of the wage scale. The social benefit system in Luxembourg exhibits some of these features . Unemployment benefits are relatively generous, with an 80 percent replacement rate, for a maximum of 12 months. Those ineligible for unemployment benefits can access the minimum guaranteed income (RMG), with amounts received varying by family status and by income up to a certain level. The RMG also includes a small housing benefit portion. Other relevant benefits include family benefits, which are not means-tested, a cost-of-living type allowance (“allocation de vie chère”), and a minimal income tax credit for work. This system results in very high METRs, particularly for those receiving unemployment benefits , for whom virtually all the additional income is taxed away when taking up employment. This effect is present up to relatively high wage income and across family status ranging from single persons to single earner couples and two-earner couples, with or without children. For example, the METR only declines below 100 percent levels at 90 percent of average wage for a single person, and at as high as 150 percent of average wage for the second earner of a two-earner couple. In the case of the RMG, the inactivity trap effect operates at lower wage ranges than with unemployment benefits, but still applies to many types of family status . The METR is above 100 percent for singles earning below 50 percent of the average wage and for single earner couples up to 70 percent of the average wage, making it difficult to leave social assistance. The latter case is illustrated in the text chart: gross wage earnings cannot replace forgone benefits (including lower RMG, minus new taxes and social contributions to be paid), as seen in the grey shaded area. It is only when pay rises above 70 percent of the average wage that the earner is able to keep more than what is lost, and the METR drops to the “normal” tax, which would include income tax as well as social contributions. Policies should focus on incentives to participate in economic activity . While the social benefit system has helped support social cohesion, it is likely to have contributed to the high rate of unemployment for unskilled workers, and to a less dynamic economy through lower participation rates. The authorities have revamped the employment agency to more actively tackle this challenge. Experiences in neighboring countries such as Germany suggest indeed that more active labor market policies help, but they also highlight the need to combine them with a reform of social benefits to address the adverse incentives related to high METR. In that respect, a reduction in social transfers could be associated with the introduction of a well-targeted earned income tax credit system.
