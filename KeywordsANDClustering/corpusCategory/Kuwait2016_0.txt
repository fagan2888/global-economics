Notwithstanding high dependence on hydrocarbons, Kuwait is well positioned to weather “lower-for-longer” oil prices. Large financial buffers—which staff estimates exceed 460 percent of GDP—and low debt provide space to smooth the needed fiscal adjustment and support growth through infrastructure spending. Resilient nonoil activity and strong oversight by the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) have kept the financial sector sound. The main challenge for policymakers is to sustain reforms that reduce susceptibility to oil price cycles and boost private sector growth and job creation. The government has announced a comprehensive agenda—the six-pillar reform strategy (Box 1)—to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment, encourage private sector development and diversification, and create jobs for the growing national labor force. Initial steps have been taken, most recently to advance energy pricing reforms and to ease registration and licensing procedures (Annex I), and several other measures are under preparation. In the wake of the recent parliamentary elections—which led to a significant turnover of National Assembly members—the outgoing Prime Minister was reappointed to form a cabinet. The new government has reaffirmed the authorities’ commitment to reforms. Steady implementation—a must to deliver concrete results over the next few years—will require building consensus in favor of economic transformation.
