Fiscal consolidation has advanced further, allowing Poland to exit the EDP one year early. The general government deficit declined to 3.2 percent of GDP last year from 4.0 percent of GDP in 2013 owing to the wage bill freeze, reduced debt servicing costs following changes to the pension system, and a cyclical rebound in tax revenues. When adjusted for the costs of the 1999 pension reform, the deficit declined to 2.8 percent of GDP, allowing Poland to exit the EDP one year ahead of schedule. Public debt also declined by about 5.5 percentage points of GDP to 50.1 percent of GDP, largely on account of changes to the 2013 pension reform (Tables 8 and 9; Annex II). By end-April, about 70 percent of the 2015 gross borrowing needs had been pre-financed. Fiscal adjustment is expected to continue, but is subject to risks. Short term. The fiscal deficit is expected to decline to around 2¾ percent of GDP in 2015 on the back of increasing revenues, supported by strong growth, and lower expenditures on social benefits as unemployment declines. However, this projection is subject to risks from lower-than- expected inflation, pre-election spending pressures, and higher-than-expected costs from restructuring of the mining sector (currently assumed at about PLN3 billion during 2015–18). Medium term. Going forward, the authorities’ Convergence Program update envisages a decline in the fiscal deficit to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2018, but has yet to identify concrete fiscal measures to do so. Staff estimates that under unchanged policies, including continued revenue gains from the pension changes and the freeze in the income tax thresholds, the deficit would decline to around 2 percent of GDP by 2019—about 1 percentage point above the authorities’ medium-term objective (MTO). The recent decision to reform large taxpayer administration and establish a single Large Taxpayer Office, in line with IMF’s technical assistance (TA) Page 27 recommendations, should help enhance domestic revenue mobilization and limit fiscal risks over the medium term. Poland: 2015 Convergence Program Update Staff supported the authorities’ fiscal plans but stressed the need to underpin them with specific measures. The planned fiscal consolidation should create sufficient policy space to allow for timely and effective response to shocks, while putting public debt on a robust downward trajectory. Short term. The 2015 fiscal stance is appropriate, but contingency planning is needed to mitigate fiscal risks. The planned gradual deficit reduction appropriately addresses the need to put public debt on a robust downward path, while being mindful of not undermining growth. The authorities should identify contingency measures in case risks materialize, including from pre-election spending pressures and lower-than-expected inflation. Medium term. Reaching the MTO would require additional effort. The authorities’ MTO of 1 percent of GDP structural deficit by 2019 remains an appropriate fiscal anchor, which would further bolster debt sustainability. However, additional measures of about 1 percent of GDP would be needed to reach this objective. Closing a third of the VAT compliance gap could increase revenue by about 0.6 percent of GDP in the medium term (Figure 9). To this end, recent IMF TA has recommended developing industry-based compliance projects and implementing strategies to fight the grey economy. A follow-up TA is planned to support the improvement of VAT administration, including through a VAT gap analysis. Consideration could be given to reducing the number of VAT rates to improve compliance and lower the burden on tax administration. Preventing the 2011 VAT increase from expiring in 2017 would help sustain revenues until tax administration reforms are finalized.

Page 28 measures to support implementation of the stabilizing expenditure rule, including by drawing on the ongoing review of selected spending categories, would strengthen its credibility. Over the longer run, additional reforms would lessen the burden of aging-related costs. Recent estimates by the IMF suggest that health expenditures will rise by some 1.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. In this context, improving expenditure efficiency would help generate fiscal space to respond to long-term aging-related fiscal pressures (Appendix III). Promoting voluntary savings through the third pillar would help reduce risks of old-age poverty, thereby limiting contingent liabilities. Addressing imbalances in the special occupational pension schemes remains essential. Authorities’ views The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment and underscored the existence of budgetary safeguards to manage fiscal risks. They noted that short-term fiscal risks, including from lower-than-expected inflation, are manageable given upside risks to the growth forecast underpinning the budget. Regarding medium-term fiscal adjustment, they were confident that strict enforcement of the stabilizing expenditure rule would support the achievement of the MTO. They also noted that the large share of discretionary expenditures in the budget (estimated by staff at around one-third of total expenditures) affords sufficient flexibility to cut expenditure over time. On the revenue side, the authorities agreed with the need to reduce the VAT revenue gap and were appreciative of the ongoing IMF TA. They noted that the new tax code recently proposed by the government aims to further strengthen tax compliance. They also acknowledged the need to reform special pension schemes for farmers and miners. IMF, 2015, Fiscal Monitor: Now Is the Time.
