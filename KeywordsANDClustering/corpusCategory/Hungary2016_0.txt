Robust growth has been accompanied by a sharp reduction in vulnerabilities, but challenges remain. Hungary endured a prolonged period of stagnation in the aftermath of the global crisis, largely attributed to significant deleveraging, fiscal consolidation, and weak external demand. Over the past three years, supportive macroeconomic policies, along with a favorable external environment—low global interest rates and low commodity prices—and high utilization of EU funds, contributed to a strong growth rebound and a welcome drop in unemployment. At the same time, the economy’s vulnerability to shocks declined substantially. The current account has been in record surplus, and external debt, especially FX- denominated, dropped sharply. Still, debt levels and financing needs remain high. While government policies have supported the economy and boosted household income, they have kept public spending elevated and the tax burden above the EU average. These policies also expanded the state’s role in the economy and shifted risks to the public sector. Also, many initiatives in the financial sector have reduced vulnerabilities, but have shifted risk to the central bank. Moreover, frequent and unpredictable policy changes and a still-high level of sectoral taxes weaken the business climate, and along with low productivity and labor market problems weigh on prospects for private investment. This clouds Hungary’s medium-term prospects and call for a strategy to comprehensively address obstacles to stronger growth. Sources: Haver Analytics; and IMF staff calculations.
