Discussions focused on policies to maintain the short term momentum while preserving Rwanda’s hard won macroeconomic stability . Staff and the authorities organized the discussions around four themes: maintaining the country’s strong performance in terms of growth and poverty reduction and gradually transitioning to a private-sector led economy ; maintaining macroeconomic control through continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies; maintaining external stability and enhancing external competitiveness; and entrenching debt sustainability by prioritizing investment projects in line with available resources, while exploring concessional borrowing to the extent feasible. The authorities have generally followed staff’s advice in the past (Box 1). The TFP component is consistent with the historical levels (see fall REO 2013) Page 9 Box 1. Rwanda’s Response to the 2012 Article IV Consultation Key Recommendations Domestic financing: Minimize domestic financing of the budget Over the past two years net domestic financing has averaged close to zero, thereby allowing domestic funding to be allocated to private sector projects. While private sector credit growth was fairly subdued at 11 percent in 2013, it is projected to pick up this year to 16 percent (y-o-y).

Improve revenue mobilization This is a central feature of the second PSI and up to now, the policy has been quite successful. The tax revenue ratio is up to about 15 percent of GDP in FY13/14, compared to 13.4 percent of GDP in FY11/12. Increase exchange rate flexibility The authorities have allowed the exchange rate to be guided by market conditions over the past two years.
