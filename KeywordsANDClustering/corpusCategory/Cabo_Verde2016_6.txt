The external position in 2015 was broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and short-term risks appear low. The External Stability Assessment (ESA) finds that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but underscores the importance of enhancing the business environment (Appendix I). The two complementary assessment models based on the extended External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology do not indicate significant misalignments of Cabo Verde’s real exchange rate. Cabo Verde’s current account has been characterized by deficits mainly reflecting FDI and, more recently, government borrowing. While the international investment position reached minus $235 million in 2015, it is not considered a threat to external stability as it reflects continued net FDI inflows. International reserves are projected to be broadly adequate at over 5 months of prospective imports over the medium term (Appendix). However, the country’s high dependence on tourism and remittances represents a significant external vulnerability in the longer run. Further improving the business environment— particularly in the area of access to financing and labor market efficiency as well as by enhancing the productivity of human and physical capital—will play an important role in diversifying production and exports and increasing resilience to external shocks.
