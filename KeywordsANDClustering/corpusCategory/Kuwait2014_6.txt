Banks are amply capitalized and liquid with stable profits, reflecting prudent regulations by the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK). Banks have a combined capital adequacy ratio of 18.3 percent, falling gross non-performing loans (NPLs) of 3.5 percent (driven by a combination of lower NPLS in real estate and equity, a pick-up in loan growth and continued write-offs of loans), and a growing provisioning ratio (general plus specific provisions) of 139 percent at end-June 2014 (Figure 11). The CBK has introduced Basel III capital regulations for conventional and the growing Islamic bank segments, including a framework for domestic systemically important banks, which will increase the regulatory capital of banks significantly, as well as regulations on leverage ratio. Regulations on short-term liquidity are in advanced stages of preparation. Banks are highly liquid with 30 percent of total assets in the form of liquid assets at end-June 2014, and the central bank does not envisage any problems with banks being able to comply with liquidity and leverage ratios when the regulation comes into effect. The Islamic banking sector has grown rapidly and now constitutes a major component of Kuwait’s national banking and the overall financial system. CBK regulations are designed to ensure a level playing field between conventional and Islamic banks, while taking into account the unique features of Islamic banking (Selected Issues Paper IV). The CBK has been proactive in introducing macroprudential regulations in line with international practices to mitigate potential financial stability risks. The main source of vulnerability to the banking system comes from credit concentration to the corporate sector and real estate, given the structure of Kuwait’s domestic market, which the central bank regulates through concentration limits. The main sectoral exposures of banks are in real estate, equity and household lending, the latter two regulated through ceilings on equity investments and debt-to-income limits, respectively. Having tracked increased activity in real estate, the central bank introduced a loan-to-value ratio for residential real estate for investment purposes of individuals in November 2013, to limit financial stability risks, which staff welcomes. Staff has also observed that activity has been recently increasing in investment properties and commercial real estate segments of the real estate market, which the central bank is closely watching and ready to use macroprudential tools to limit potential stability risks to the banking system arising from this sector. The market share of the local Islamic banks has increased from 23 percent of banking system assets at end-2005 to 39 percent by end-June 2014. The status of compliance with FSAP recommendations are given in Annex II.

ICs in Kuwait are mainly investment vehicles, and do not perform a major role in credit intermediation. Although the sector as a whole is making profits, a few ICs continue to make losses and some of them are under protracted restructuring (Figure 12). Staff was of the view that stronger regulatory oversight by the CMA is needed to strengthen this sector and engender consolidation in view of its interconnectedness to the rest of the financial system. The completion of the new draft corporate bankruptcy law could help expedite the restructuring of some loss-making ICs, and implementation of the corporate governance code would help strengthen the sector, on which the CMA is planning a communication campaign to ensure that companies adopt it by the extended deadline of June 2016. The CMA expalined that it conducts onsite and offsite supervision of ICs and funds under its supervision, and imposes minimum capital requirements, and regulations on liquidity and leverage, which are constantly under review. The CMA is also conducting a major review of its by-laws, and working toward harmonizing listing and disclosure requirements for funds. Measures of shadow banking vary widely for Kuwait depending on the definition used (Selected Issues Paper V). Staff and the authorities shared the view that shadow banking provides important complementarities to the banking system, and regulation and supervision should focus on strengthening the monitoring of shadow banking institutions and activities with an emphasis on those that pose systemic risks to financial stability (Figure 4). Increased monitoring of shadow banking (activities and entities), including expanding data coverage for Other Financial Corporations operating in Kuwait as well as data sharing among regulators, together with a formal macroprudential policy framework, would allow for an early, reliable and comprehensive identification, assessment and containment of systemic risks. Staff’s assessment shows that measures of shadow banking for Kuwait vary between 2 percent of GDP (activity- based) and 60 percent of GDP (institution-based) depending on the definition used, and are subject to important data limitations. The ICs, which account for a major share of the institution-based measure of shadow banking is regulated by the CMA.

Page 21 Figure 4. Financial Sector Structure Continued coordination between the regulatory and supervisory bodies and enhanced surveillance tools will facilitate effective monitoring and management of potential systemic risks. Such a framework should include (i) strengthening the macroprudential arrangements for policymaking and coordination through a formal mandate (ii) further strengthening the Early Warning System (EWS) for identifying and monitoring systemic risks, including expanding early warning indicators for the corporate and real estate sectors, and making macro stress testing an integral part of systemic surveillance; (iii) enhancing the existing macroprudential toolkit; and (iv) implementing structural measures over the medium term, including further developing domestic interbank money and debt markets to support liquidity management, modernizing the insolvency regimes and supporting judiciary framework, and strengthening crisis management and resolution systems. The CBK should be provided with enhanced powers in this regard (Selected Issues Paper VI). The authorities continue to strengthen the Anti Money Laundering/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, and looks forward to their continuing work with the Financial Action Task Force. A Fund technical assistance project supported the authorities in developing and adopting an AML/CFT law and regulations in line with international standards, establishing a high level AML/CFT National Strategic Committee, setting up the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the oversight of the Minister of Finance that became recently operational, and establishing comprehensive mechanisms to freeze terrorist assets. Going forward, Kuwait is expected to continue improving the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime, and strengthening the role of the FIU. 10015020025030070,00080,00090,000100,000110,000120,000200820092010201120122013Jun-14 Kuwait: Financial Sector, 2008-2014 1/ (million KD, percent of GDP) Total Financial Sector Entities (with data) Total Financial Sector Entities (percent of GDP, RHS) 020,00040,00060,000020,00040,00060,000200820092010201120122013Jun-14 Banking Sector Assets Banking Sector Contra Accounts Exchange companies (EC) IC assets IC Contra Accounts Insurance Companies Assets Pension Funds Finance Companies Assets Kuwait: Financial Sector Structure, 2008-2014 (million KD) Sources: Country authorities; June 2014 Fitch Report (for Public Sector Pension Funds assets); and IMF staff calculations.1/Assets for Insurance Companies only included startingin 2013.
