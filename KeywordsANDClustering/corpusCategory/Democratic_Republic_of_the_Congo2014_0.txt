major challenge . The DRC was suspended in April 2013 from the EITI for a year, but expects to become compliant by May 2014 upon completion of certain reporting requirements. Transparency should also extend to the infrastructure loans under the Sicomines agreement (DSA, paragraphs 9 and 13). Structural reforms aimed at improving the governance of SOEs in the mining sector have been introduced, but progress remains slow. Moreover, Gécamines, beneficiary of mining royalties that would otherwise accrue to the Treasury, continues to divest assets without competitive biddings in disregard of a government’s decree. The SOEs claim that a recent change in their status to commercial enterprises enables them to make independent business decisions. Consistent with World Bank’s advice, staff urged the authorities to closely monitor the sale of assets by SOEs and improve their management by strengthening the capacity and accountability of government representatives on their boards of directors. Lastly, the authorities could benefit from drawing on international best practices when revising the mining and petroleum codes (the former being discussed with stakeholders and the latter tabled before parliament) and from strengthening the anti-money laundering framework to address the illegal exploitation of natural resources. Page 12 Authorities’ view The authorities concurred that governance and transparency of the sector remain a challenge, including the corporate governance of the SOEs operating in the sector . They pointed to the NCMRM organized in January 2013 to promote best practices and the subsequent governance matrix (GM) agreed with the World Bank aimed at enhancing transparency across the board in the management of natural resources. They indicated that 136 mining contracts have been published and annual productions and exports for 2003–12 have been made available.
