Since the mid-2000s, good macroeconomic performance and active social policies have helped nearly triple income per capita and reduce extreme poverty in Bolivia . Prudent fiscal policies allowed saving a sizable portion of the hydrocarbon revenue windfall from the commodity price boom, improving the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks. Reflecting this, Bolivia was one of few countries in Latin America that sustained positive growth during the global crisis of 2008–09 and weathered well the recent regional slowdown. At the same time, deep political and social changes have been taking place. The 2009 Constitution dictates substantial revisions to the legal and policy frameworks. The authorities’ economic strategy is aligned with new constitutional requirements and envisages the expansion and industrialization of natural resource production. The authorities are also making inroads to tackle still high levels of poverty, inequality, child and maternal mortality rates, and improve access to public services in remote areas.
