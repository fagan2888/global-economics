In 2014, the budget primary surplus target is likely to be missed. Although, due to high inflation, growth of central government revenues is in line with the budget forecast despite weaker domestic demand, expenditures have been allowed to grow above the budget ceilings. Total primary revenues have increased by 10 percent y-o-y through August and are projected to increase by 9 percent in 2014, exceeding the budget forecast by about 0.2 percent of GDP, largely due high inflation and one-offs. Central government primary spending has grown by 13½ percent y-o-y through August, compared with a budget target of 7.4 percent for the year, which will lead to an overrun in primary expenditure of about 1 percent of GDP. On a net basis, the central government primary balance is therefore likely to miss the budget target by about 0.2 percent of GDP. In the broader non-financial public sector, the deviation from the authorities’ plan is expected to be somewhat higher as a result of a weaker than planned performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) due to delayed adjustments in regulated energy prices, enacted in October. The structural deficit remains large, although debt sustainability is not a concern (Annex I). Despite relatively strong headline fiscal indicators, the structural deficit remains large at about 3 percent of GDP this year. Non-discretionary central government primary spending remains about two-thirds of total expenditure. Between 2006 and 2013, central government primary spending has grown by 5.4 percentage points of GDP, more than the 3 percentage point of GDP decline in interest spending. Over this period, buoyant revenues—mainly taxes on consumption and imports—have kept the budget balance from deteriorating. However, this masks a widening structural deficit , as consumption and imports, which are relatively revenue-rich, will have to decline when the economy rebalances towards exports and investment. This could limit fiscal policy space in a downturn, even with debt below 36 percent of GDP. Privatization revenues are below the line and not accounted in the fiscal balances quoted above. However, in Turkey the law allows for excess privatization revenues to be spent freely and hence they are financing sources for additional spending. The structural deficit calculation is based on an absorption gap approach. Page 14 Box 4.

Using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) this box analyzes different approaches to reducing the external imbalance. It concludes that a combination of increased private and public savings would yield the best results. This contrasts with recent developments, where investment has been curtailed by one-off monetary policy tightening and a higher country risk premium. Four approaches are analyzed. These are i ) a 2 percent of GDP permanent increase in private savings (e.g., through setting up a second pillar pension system or prefunding severance payments); ii ) a 2 percent of GDP permanent increase in public savings (through lower transfers, lower public consumption, and increased VAT); iii ) a 2 percentage point increase in the monetary policy rate for one year; and iv ) an increase in the country risk premium (an initial 4 percent increase that gradually falls to ½ percent), which might follow from a protracted failure to adjust policies. Relative to the baseline, GDP falls in the first year of the adjustment in all four scenarios. Tighter monetary policy has the largest immediate negative impact on GDP of about 2½ percent. A higher country risk premium has a persistent negative impact on GDP (of about 2 percent) as it permanently reduces investment. Higher private or public savings have limited negative impacts with increased private savings increasing GDP in the long run. Tighter monetary policy and a higher country risk premium affect private investment negatively. The increased country risk premium leads to 10 percent lower investment for three years after which it settles at a 4 percent lower level in the longer run. Tighter monetary policy reduces investment temporarily by about 4 percent. Increased private and public savings affect investment only moderately with a slight positive effect from increased private savings. Tighter monetary policy has limited effects on the current account. Monetary policy tightening has a positive impact on the current account through import contraction as private domestic demand slows. However, it will also have negative effects as the higher interest rate leads to exchange rate appreciation. The net effect is a limited (less than ½ percent of GDP) and short lived improvement in the current account. Increased private or public savings reduce the external imbalance. Policies to increase public and private savings improve the current account by 1 percent of GDP in the short run and 1½-2 percent of GDP in the longer run, entirely through higher national savings. A higher country risk premium also leads to an immediate current account improvement of 2 percent of GDP due to a sharp (5 percent) temporary depreciation. However, this is driven by lower private investment with negative growth consequences both in the short and long run.

The excessive burden on monetary policy calls for a frontloaded fiscal adjustment. In addition, a stronger public balance sheet would counterweigh the trend deterioration in private sector balance sheets, by creating fiscal space to cushion private deleveraging in the event of a shock. …and advised that a tighter fiscal stance should be pursued. In the short run, staff suggested expenditure growth be curbed, in recognition of the fact that meeting the 2014 budget ceiling is no longer feasible. For the 2015–17 medium-term plan (see Box 5), staff recommended a cumulative fiscal adjustment of 2 percent of GDP vis-à-vis staff’s baseline. This is akin to achieving a central government primary surplus of close to 2 percent by 2017. Staff welcomed the planned start of this adjustment in the 2014–16 medium-term plan (MTP). However, on staff’s projection the authorities’ target for 2016 in the 2014–16 MTP will be missed by about 1 percent of GDP. Thus, the mission recommended frontloading the adjustment in the next two budgets, targeting an increase in the primary balance of 1½ percent of GDP by 2016, and an additional ½ percent in 2017 in the 2015–17 MTP. The recommended adjustment is skewed towards expenditure rather than revenue measures. This is because indirect taxation is already high, there are some upside risks to personnel, social security and capital expenditures, and because budget flexibility needs to be preserved. Staff also argued for permanent rather than temporary measures. Given the macroeconomic imbalances, staff sees room for discretionary fiscal stimulus only in the case of a major shock that would push the economy into recession.

Authorities’ views The authorities agreed that there could be expenditure overruns in 2014, but believe that the budget headline targets will be missed by less than expected by staff. They forecast lower primary expenditure than projected by staff, and point to their new tax amnesty—which affects about TL100 billion of arrears—as a possible upside risk to tax revenues and to social security collections, which would reduce transfers from the central government. In addition, they expect a slowdown in capital spending in the later part of the year, which will help contain the expenditure overrun. Page 16 Box 5. The 2015–17 Medium-Term Program The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the medium-term program are more conservative than last year’s. The growth trajectory has been shifted downwards in the short-term, while inflation will take longer to converge to the central bank’s target. The current account deficit for 2014 was revised down by about ¾ of a percent of GDP, in part as a result of slower growth and a more competitive exchange rate, with further adjustments in the medium term, albeit at a more modest pace. The MTP’s assumption of higher savings, fostered by tighter fiscal policy and structural reforms, would be consistent with a reduced external imbalance. GDP growth MTP 13-15 MTP 14-16 MTP 15-17 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Inflation MTP 13-15 MTP 14-16 MTP 15-17 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Current account deficit MTP 13-15 MTP 14-16 MTP 15-17 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Staff is less sanguine about growth prospects than the MTP. In staff’s view the authorities’ adequate emphasis on fiscal adjustment will contribute to reducing the external imbalance and support the central bank’s efforts to bring inflation to target. However, it will likely also result in lower growth than the authorities’ objective in the MTP. Staff considers that there is little slack in the economy and, while structural reforms could raise growth potential, they will likely take time to implement and for results to materialize. The new MTP envisages a tighter fiscal stance over the medium term. While there is some slippage in 2014, the target for the public sector remains unchanged for 2015, with a more aggressive adjustment for latter years than previously envisaged. Encouragingly, the adjustment is predicated on reducing spending at the central government level. The stronger fiscal adjustment and the emphasis on current spending are welcome developments. The tighter stance will contribute to the gradual reduction of external imbalances, and ameliorate pressure on monetary policy. However, the reduction in spending will prove challenging if the expected growth fails to materialize, as has been the case with previous MTPs.

Although they see no need to increase the primary surplus on grounds of debt sustainability, they believe a stronger public sector position is needed to help reduce the external imbalance and rebuild fiscal buffers. They also broadly share the view that containing expenditure is the key to improving the structural balance. Thus, they aim to increase the primary surplus towards 2 percent of GDP in the next three years, starting with about 1 percent of GDP adjustment in the 2015 budget. In addition, they have adjusted energy prices so as to eliminate losses in the SOE sector.
