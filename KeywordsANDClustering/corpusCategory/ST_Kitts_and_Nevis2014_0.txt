CONSOLIDATION Considerable progress has been achieved under the three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). Firm signs of a recovery were present in the first nine months of 2013 after a four-year contraction. The fiscal position has improved significantly as a result of adjustment and reforms, as well as considerable growth in non-tax revenue. There has been substantial progress in reducing public debt through debt restructuring. The financial sector has remained resilient and the external position has improved. Economic activity in 2013 is recovering, with a pickup in tourism and construction. Following a prolonged slowdown, with GDP declining by a cumulative 10 percent in 2009–2012, economic growth is projected to be 1.7 percent in 2013 although the recovery in Nevis is weaker. This reflects a recovery in tourism and construction, the latter fueled by the large inflows under the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program, other FDI projects, and Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) (Box 1). A decline in the manufacturing sector with the loss of an important bottling license for two international brands and the temporary closure of a major electronics plant due to mechanical problems, and a fall in the communication sector, have moderated the recovery. CPI inflation has remained low at 0.4 percent at end-December (y/y). The external position has significantly strengthened. A recovery in tourism receipts and strong CBI fees, together with weak imports reflecting sluggish demand through 2012 have narrowed the current account deficit, from over 20 percent of GDP prior to 2011 to about 12 percent in 2012 and 8½ percent in 2013. The stronger current account balance together with capital inflows led to an accumulation of international reserves since the start of the SBA, from 5-months-of- imports to over 8 months at end-November 2013 (6 months excluding IMF disbursements). The fiscal position of the central government has further strengthened, with continued strong CBI fee receipts and sustained budgetary discipline. Under the three-year SBA, the fiscal balance has improved from a deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to a projected surplus of 10.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and the primary balance strengthened from a deficit of 0.8 percent to a surplus of 15.5 percent of GDP. The largest contributor to the adjustment has been the sharp increase in CBI fee receipts, from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated 13 percent of GDP in 2013. Moreover, in line with the program, the implementation of the VAT boosted tax revenue in 2011 while hiring and the wage bill were frozen since 2010. Other expenditures have also been contained, while capital spending declined from 6.8 percent in 2010 to 4.7 percent in 2013. The 36-month SBA was approved on July 27, 2011 for SDR 52.51 million (590 percent of quota), and SDR 47.37 million have been disbursed to date. The SIDF is an autonomous entity, which was created in 2006 after the closure of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation to support, develop and diversify the economy. All of its funding comes from the CBI program. Page 6 Substantial progress has been made in reducing public debt, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected to decline from 164 percent of GDP in 2010 to 105 percent of GDP in 2013 as a result of debt restructuring, with the debt-for-land swap with domestic creditors finalized in June 2013. Private sector credit, after stagnating since 2012, is now declining notwithstanding ample bank liquidity. The banking system remains the strongest in the region, relatively well capitalized and with ample liquidity. Deposits—which remain banks’ primary source of funding— have grown, dominated by CBI inflows. Nonetheless, banks’ NPLs rose from 6.6 percent at end-2011 to 10.5 percent at end-September 2013, notably due to removing government loans from total loans following the debt-for-land swap. Despite the emerging recovery, credit to the private sector, which had been flat through 2012, contracted by 2.6 percent (y/y) through end-November 2013 reflecting banks’ concerns about higher NPLs, reluctance to increase their exposure to tourism, and the fact that the recovery has been mostly financed by FDI or CBI inflows. Capitalization, well above the regulatory benchmark, and profits were somewhat adversely impacted by the growing NPLs and the reduction in interest earned on government loans after the debt restructuring.

The supervision of the non-bank financial institutions has strengthened. The Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) assumed responsibility for credit unions in 2012. Its implementation of a new supervisory framework based on the PEARLS prudential rating has led to an increase in credit unions NPLs from 10 percent at end-2012 to 21 percent at end-September At the same time, credit unions’ assets grew by 11 percent (y/y) in September 2013. The government remains challenged in Parliament because of the outstanding motion of no confidence. In early 2013, two members of the government joined the opposition party, which had tabled a motion of no confidence in December 2012.

The 2014 budget of St. Kitts and Nevis was approved on December 11, 2013. The Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), affiliated with the federal opposition party, won the January 2013 election in Nevis. In line with the Constitution, elections are due by June 2015.
