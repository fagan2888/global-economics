Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in 2013 and inflation stayed subdued, but unemployment remained a concern. Real GDP growth was lower than expected at 3.1 percent in 2013, mainly due to weak demand for construction, sugar and tourism. With subdued international prices and despite large public sector wage increases, inflation fell to 3.5 percent. The unemployment rate is estimated to have increased marginally to 8.2 percent. Moody’s maintained the country’s credit rating at Baa1. The fiscal policy stance was more expansionary than planned because of one-off and cyclical factors but also slippages. The structural primary balance excluding grants (SPBEG)—a measure of the fiscal impulse—deteriorated by over 2 percent of GDP relative to 2012 rather than the planned neutral stance. While revenues in 2013 were broadly unchanged relative to GDP, expenditures increased by 2 percent of GDP, of which ¾ percent of GDP were related to the flash floods in Port Louis. There also were unplanned transfers to local governments and Page 6 public enterprises. Wages increased as expected by 1 percent of GDP reflecting the recommendations of the Pay Research Bureau’s (PRB) report, which adjusts wages beyond the annual inflation adjustment every five years. Also, capital spending including the special funds was 1 percent of GDP higher, partially due to cost overruns. Gross public sector debt reached almost 60 percent of GDP at end-2013 (55 percent of GDP for public debt law purposes). Monetary policy was somewhat accommodative during 2013, but inflation declined nevertheless. Pass-through of the public sector wage increases into private sector wages was limited and inflation expectations remain well anchored; helped by sluggish domestic demand and low international price pressures. The Bank of Mauritius (BOM) maintained the policy rate at 4.65 percent, following a 25 basis point reduction in June 2013. The nominal effective exchange rate has been relatively stable (see Figure 1); the rupee depreciated by 0.4 percent in real effective terms last year. The trade balance improved slightly, but the current account deficit increased mainly on account of a decline in service exports. Exports of goods and services increased by only some 3 percent in dollar terms (tourism receipts dropped by 9 percent related to a slow European recovery). Imports of goods and services increased marginally by 2 percent. The decline of net income, particularly from the GBC sector (possibly related to low global interest rates), contributed to widen the current account deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 10 percent in 2013. The BOM accumulated additional net international reserves and the reserve cover of imports of goods and services remained at 4.4 months at end-2013. The banking system remained profitable and BOM strengthened macro-prudential measures. Banks capital—at 14.6 percent of Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets in June 2013—remains, well above Basel II and proposed Basel III requirements. Banks have remained profitable with 15 percent return on equity, despite low leverage ratios. BOM is consulting with banks on implementation of Basel III regulations. BOM continued to publish its bi- annual CAMEL ratings for all domestic banks. Non-performing loans (NPLs) increased slightly to 3.7 percent by June 2013. The BOM implemented macroprudential measures aimed at addressing emerging NPLs in the construction and real estate sectors as well as rising indebtedness. Page 7 Figure 1.
