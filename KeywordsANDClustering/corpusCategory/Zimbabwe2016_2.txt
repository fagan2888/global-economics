All of the quantitative targets for end-December 2015 were met (Table 8). The floor on the primary cash balance and the net international reserves target were met with comfortable margins. The floor on protected social spending, the target for Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) payments, and the ceiling on nonconcessional debt were also met. The remaining three structural benchmarks for the third review were also met (Table 9). The cabinet approved: (a) the amendments to the Public Financial Management (PFM) Act and the PFM Bill was submitted to the parliament in November; and (b) the amendments to the Procurement Act to tighten the public procurement framework and improve efficiency and transparency. In early-January 2016, the authorities published the new framework, procedures and guidelines for implementing the indigenization policy on the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) website. While this helped by continuing the dialogue on the policy, more needs to be done to tie up loose ends and implement the policy in a transparent and non-discretionary manner (Annex IV). In addition, meaningful progress has been made in implementing the broader structural reform agenda. However, the authorities need to follow through with further implementation of key measures, particularly the new indigenization framework, reducing the wage bill, and reducing the cost of doing business.
