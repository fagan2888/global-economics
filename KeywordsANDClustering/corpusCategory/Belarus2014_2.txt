The outlook is for continued slow growth and persistent external imbalances. With very weak Russian growth weighing on external demand and with domestic demand slowing, only 0.9 percent GDP growth is expected this year. Thereafter, activity remains constrained by structural deficiencies and structurally reduced growth prospects in Russia, which prompt a downward revision of Belarus’ medium-term growth to about 2¾ percent. Inflation is forecast to remain around 16 percent on rubel depreciation and high inflation expectations. The current account deficit is projected at 8¾ percent of GDP in 2014 on weak external demand, low competitiveness, and a policy mix that continues to be too loose. Going forward, limited financing and increasingly low reserves do not permit such high deficits. Therefore, the staff’s stylized baseline scenario assumes gradual exchange rate depreciation that brings about sufficient current account improvement to prevent full depletion of reserves, but not enough to address imbalances and rebuild buffers. Hence, the baseline scenario implies continued very high vulnerabilities throughout the forecast period. Without the stylized assumptions of the baseline, vulnerabilities and the risk of a disorderly adjustment are even higher. Risks are high and tilted to the downside. The main risks are for further balance of payments deterioration and external financing shortfalls. Ongoing developments in Ukraine also pose risks—notably through their impact on Russia—as does possible protracted slow growth in other trade partners (Box 1). Meanwhile, banking sector risks remain substantial on weak loan portfolios and rapid FX lending growth. On the upside, higher-than-envisaged support from Russia or other donors, or successful privatization of a large Belarusian company could alleviate short-term financing constraints.
