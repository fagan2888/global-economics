The Swiss economy has performed solidly during 2010–15 . GDP growth averaged 1¾ percent, the unemployment rate has been broadly steady around 3 percent, and the external sector performed well, with the current account surplus averaging 11 percent of GDP. In addition, real incomes had been boosted by sustained decreases in prices of imported products. More generally, growth has been in line with the average for advanced economies, supported by a favorable business environment (for 2016, the World Economic Forum again ranked Switzerland the globally most competitive country). This solid performance occurred despite challenges stemming from Switzerland’s status as a safe haven . Global risk-off episodes (most recently following the Brexit vote) and monetary policy easing by the major central banks have triggered intermittent capital inflow surges into Switzerland. As a result, the nominal and real effective exchange rates (NEER and REER) appreciated by 40 percent and 24 percent, respectively, since 2008, leading the authorities to introduce and subsequently remove an exchange rate floor against the euro. Switzerland’s direct democracy and close EU relations have contributed to political stability and widespread support for domestic policies . With Switzerland located in the center of Europe, the EU is a key partner, and their economies, labor markets and policies are closely linked. Notwithstanding this close relationship, the Swiss population adopted a popular initiative in February 2014 to limit mass immigration (Box 1). A solution agreeable to both the Swiss and the EU is being sought.
