A third year of growth below potential has resulted in a moderate output gap. Having expanded by almost 5 percent annually in 2010–2012, growth slowed to 2½ percent in 2013–14. This reflected both gradual weakening of domestic demand following the rebound from the 2008–09 crisis as well as sluggish export growth, the latter mirroring the pace of the U.S. recovery. Growth picked up to 3¾ percent in 2015, as the boost to domestic demand from improved terms of trade, associated with lower commodity prices, and higher investment more than offset the drag from Intel manufacturing’s closure, adverse weather conditions for the main agricultural export crops, and slightly contractionary financial conditions—the latter reflecting higher real lending rates and real Output gap Real growth Potential growth GDP growth, Potential and Output Gap (Percent) Sources: National authorities, and IMF staff estimates Page 10 appreciation (¶9). Nevertheless, both private and public investment recovered significantly, the latter supported by construction of a new port terminal and public water systems. Overall, with growth below its trend rate of 4 percent during 2013-15, a negative output gap of about 1 percent of GDP has opened up (Analytical Note (AN) VIII). The unemployment rate has been elevated since the crisis; its slight decline in 2015 was mainly due to lower participation from discouraged workers. The central bank took advantage of the favorable shock from lower oil prices to reduce its inflation target range. Inflation increased sharply and breached its upper limit in 2014, owing mostly to the pass-through to domestic prices from XR depreciation in early 2014. The breach was short-lived, though, as the sharp decline in imported oil prices, tight monetary policy, and a widening output gap drove inflation into negative territory by the second half of 2015. The central bank reacted by cutting the policy rate by 350 basis points to 1¾ percent. It also availed itself of the propitious circumstances—with inflation projected to stay below the 3–5 target range until the end of 2016 and inflation expectations falling for the first time below the center of the range—to lower the target to 2–4 percent, in line with average inflation of trading partners. The exchange rate has been stable despite abandonment of the band regime, and reserve accumulation has resumed strongly. After a short period of heightened volatility in early 2014, amid increased prospects for U.S. monetary policy normalization, the XR quickly stabilized again about 6–7 percent above the floor of the XR band, and remained there despite the early-2015 removal of the band, in line with Fund advice to strengthen the inflation targeting framework. A lower current account deficit—4 percent of GDP in 2015, driven by lower oil prices—as well as continued government Eurobond issuance, resilient FDI flows, and increased net foreign bank liabilities to meet renewed demand for credit in FX resulted in continued strong foreign reserve accumulation, in line with the authorities FX purchase program, to $7.8 bn at end-2015, above the Intel’s closure resulted in both lower real GDP and lower potential output of ¾ percent of GDP in 2014-15, without any effect on the output gap in the short run.

Nonetheless, in December 2015 and early 2016, reserves declined somewhat, as FX demand, including by financial intermediaries, increased and the central bank accommodated it, resulting in a flat XR. The external position is close to equilibrium, with competitiveness largely unchanged in 2014–15. In the first half of 2014, a third of the 30 percent real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation accumulated over the last decade was undone, as nominal colón depreciation outpaced a growing inflation differential. Since then, however, the REER rose steadily until stabilizing about 5 percent above its end-2013 level. At the same time, this increase is consistent with the change in the REER equilibrium value and, as a result, competitiveness has not deteriorated (Box 1). In particular, multilaterally consistent estimates under the EBA and other regression-based approaches support this view. Nevertheless, productivity-enhancing reforms (¶32) and wage restraint are needed to maintain Costa Rica’s competitiveness in world markets. Fiscal consolidation (¶18-23) would also buttress long-term external stability. External Sustainability Assessment Failure to reverse the countercyclical fiscal policies implemented during the global financial crisis put public debt on a rapid upward trend. Attempts to curb government outlays, mainly through capital expenditure cuts in 2011, were undermined by the rising transfers (to decentralized public entities) and interest bill in 2012–2013. Tax collections, after falling from pre- crisis levels that were boosted by GDP growth well above trend, remained stagnant, with a revenue- enhancing tax reform nullified by the Constitutional Court owing to procedural irregularities in 2012. Consequently, the central government (CG) primary deficit returned to its crisis peak of around 3 percent of GDP in 2013. The new administration that came into power in mid-2014 maintained a broadly unchanged non-interest deficit, as efforts to After a substantial decline in 2014 reflecting in part the end of reinvestment of retained earnings by Intel, FDI remained steady in 2015, suggesting limited impact of the exit on broader FDI trends. EE EE EE ili " " = Page 12 restrain spending and reduce tax evasion prevented a budgeted deterioration in the primary balance of more than ½ percent of GDP in 2014–15. Meanwhile, a rising interest bill has lifted the overall CG deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2014-15, with debt exceeding 42 percent of GDP in 2015. Though the impact on domestic financing costs has been muted by the annual $1 bn external bond issuance since 2012 and aggressive monetary easing in 2015, spreads on external bonds have doubled since the 2013 tapering tantrum and the country lost its investment grade in 2014. The authorities have developed a strategy for fiscal consolidation focused on strengthening revenue. The new government initially formulated a consolidation proposal focused on reducing tax evasion and a few exemptions. Since then, a more comprehensive plan, that is broadly consistent with staff recommendations both in its size and its emphasis on revenue enhancements through tax base widening and higher rates, has been developed (¶21). Potential Output Growth and Output Gap Estimates (In percent) The recent loosening of monetary policy is expected to bring about financial conditions more supportive of growth. Real lending rates have been edging upwards since mid- Moody’s downgraded Costa Rica’s external sovereign debt by one notch in 2014 with a negative outlook on its current Ba1 rating. S&P downgraded the sovereign by one notch to BB- in 2016, while Fitch has a negative outlook on its BB+ rating since 2015.

Page 13 2014, as limited transmission of the large policy rate cuts to lending rates thus far has been more than offset by the fall in inflation expectations. In addition, the REER has resumed its appreciating trend and credit growth has moderated. A broad-based index (FCI) developed by staff (featuring the influence on economic activity of credit, deposits, real interest rates, REER, and house prices) suggests that financial conditions were slightly contractionary in 2015, owing to higher real interest rates and real appreciation (AN III). However, this is likely to be reversed as the lower policy rates gradually complete their pass-through. Monetary transmission, though, is hamstrung by high dollarization, segmentation of the banking system, limited capital market development (¶33 and AN V), and anticipation of forthcoming upward pressures on interest rates from large budgetary financing needs. The financial system appears sound, though profitability is low and dollarization continues to be a source of vulnerability. Bank capital is well above regulatory requirements and liquidity indicators are robust. While non-performing loans have remained low, profitability has declined slightly in recent years, and remains below that of regional peers. Reliance on foreign funding has continued to increase, although staff analysis suggests that associated rollover risks remain manageable even under scenarios of extreme shocks in international banking systems. Moreover, macroeconomic trends are consistent with recent and anticipated credit growth and there is little evidence of financial sector risk buildup (ANs I and II). Indeed, while the depth of Costa Rica’s financial system improved considerably in the past decade, it continues to lag those of comparable emerging markets as well as the degree of development implied by its macroeconomic fundamentals. In particular, credit to the private sector is still well below the estimated level consistent with fundamentals (ANs IV and V). Amid renewed exchange rate stability since late 2014, however, credit growth has again tilted toward FX, including to sectors without natural FX hedges, despite already high levels of bank loan dollarization.
