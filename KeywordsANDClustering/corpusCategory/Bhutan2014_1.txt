GDP growth in Bhutan has been strong over the Tenth FYP, driven by the hydropower sector. However, growth is projected to have slowed to 5 percent in FY 2013 from over 10 percent in FY2011, due to policy efforts to moderate credit growth to contain overheating pressures. The fiscal year (FY) begins July 1. Page 6 Restrictions on credit for construction and vehicle imports led to a decline in services sector growth, particularly in transport and financial services, as well as a decline in construction sector growth. Inflation remains elevated above double digits, mostly reflecting price developments in India, given the peg to the Indian rupee Headline inflation reached 11.3 percent in December 2013, accelerating from 9.5 percent in December 2012. Inflation is projected to average above 10 percent in FY 2014, but should decline over the medium term in line with moderation in Indiaâ€™s inflation. Staff analysis has found that inflation in Bhutan is closely related to Indian inflation (see Box 2). The current account (CA) deficit remains sizable and is financed through substantial aid inflows. The CA deficit, reflecting large hydropower-related imports, widened to 22.8 percent of GDP in FY 2013 from 15 percent of GDP on average over the 10 FYP. In addition, hydro-related auxiliary activities and a consumption and housing boom added to the rapid increase in non-hydropower imports. Nonetheless, robust aid inflows have led to a positive overall balance of payments position, enabling the continued accumulation of international reserves, which stood at US$ 933 million (over 10 months of import cover) in December 2013.
