The program aims to improve expenditure management and fiscal risk monitoring (MEFP Â¶11). The recent emphasis on overdue payments and quasi-fiscal obligations related to state enterprises highlights the need for measures to bolster public financial management (PFM), as elaborated below. Commitment control. To control expenditure within fiscal resources and without incurring future arrears, the authorities will establish a commitment control system based on commitment records and quarterly expenditure commitment ceilings, starting from mid-2016. The program also supports timely roll-out of the new Integrated Treasury Management Information System (ITMIS), which will significantly expand PFM capabilities, including commitment control, budget preparation, treasury, accounting, and procurement. Fiscal reporting and risk. To improve fiscal transparency, the authorities plan to publish quarterly financial bulletins summarizing government fiscal operations; ensure that Page 33 annual budgets explicitly cost out tax expenditures; and adhere to Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) standards. The authorities also plan to include in the annual budget analysis of fiscal risks including those related to SOEs and public-private partnerships (PPPs).
