Large grants and remittances in recent years have helped Tonga build up adequate international reserve buffers. The current account deficit is projected to be around 5 percent of GDP in 2014/15, and to move around 2-5 percent of GDP in the medium term, while international reserves are expected to remain above the NRBT’s comfort zone of 3–4 months of imports. The increase in foreign assets, largely due to grant inflows, has also contributed to the rise in domestic liquidity. Grant inflows have been relatively stable, reflecting Tonga’s favorable performance in policy reforms, and the remittance inflows have also been stable, reflecting diversified sources (e.g., the U.S., New Zealand and Australia). Maintaining international reserves at the current level will help safeguard external stability. Overall, staff’s assessment indicates that reserve holdings (in months of imports) are adequate in light of the need to absorb frequent external shocks and the low opportunity cost of holding reserves in Tonga (Box 2). The pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands has served the country well. Staff’s exchange rate assessment suggests that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3). In addition, other indicators (for example, tourist arrivals) continue to show no significant loss of competitiveness for Tonga. Authorities’ Views The authorities concurred with staff’s exchange rate assessments. On the foreign reserve adequacy, the authorities recognized the merit of the staff’s policy recommendation to safeguard external stability, but they believed that 3–4 months of import cover is a more realistic target for Tonga, partly because the high level of reserves in recent years was due to delays in implementation of donor-funded projects and hence may not be sustainable.
