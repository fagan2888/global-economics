Policy Issues and Staff’s Views Going forward, further private sector development will be essential to support and stabilize growth and, hence, secure fiscal sustainability In spite of the recent expansion of the fishing sector, the public sector remains the main source of economic activity. Private sector development is limited by remoteness, small size, a poor regulatory framework and weak business climate (Box 3 and Figure 3). In addition, SOEs compete against private enterprises in some sectors, such as telecommunications and hospitality, on an unequal footing, given their access to subsidized credit. Policies are needed to enhance private sector growth prospects . The government could work with development partners, the private sector and neighboring countries to upgrade both capital and human resources and to secure cheaper and more reliable air links to and within the country. Structural reforms should address the issues of weak competition due to SOE dominance in some industries and the wide public and private sector wage gap. The authorities could consider the introduction of an insolvency framework and further land registration reforms to facilitate firm access to credit. Furthermore, easing procedures for long-term land leases to nonresidents could help attract foreign direct investment. The Authorities’ Views There was general agreement about the impediments to private sector development. Structural obstacles on land use were regarded as deeply rooted in tradition, and very difficult to remove. The authorities noted that SOE reforms were underway with the assistance of the AsDB and the World Bank, and indicated that a law to liberalize the telecommunication sector was awaiting parliament approval. They also pointed out that the gap between public and private sector wages was due to the fact that the public sector employs more skilled workers than the private sector.
