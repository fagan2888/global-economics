Lack of coordination and clarity on policies as the country moved through two elections in less than nine months gave rise to both macroeconomic imbalances and a decline in investor confidence. Macroeconomic performance in 2015 reflected a mix between positive underlying growth momentum, the negative impact of unbalanced domestic policies, and an increasingly difficult external environment. Real GDP growth was 4.8 percent in 2015 (broadly unchanged from 2014), on the basis of strong growth in services (particularly tourism), continued growth in agriculture, and positive (albeit declining) contribution from manufacturing. The negative growth in construction and weaker growth in manufacturing were indicative of a slowdown in public and private investment, as well as the negative effects of slowing world trade. The economy is currently estimated to be operating slightly below its potential. The industrial production index grew by 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 (somewhat lower than the 2010 15 historical average), while the unemployment rate remains at 4.3 percent in end 2015, close to the historical norm. Headline inflation ended the year at 2.8 percent and dropped marginally to 2 percent as of March 2016, but core inflation continued to rise—reaching 4.5 percent by end 2015 and hitting 5.7 percent in February before dropping back to remaining at 4.5 percent by end-March. Private credit growth (at 25 percent in 2015) was well above both the historical average and the authorities’ benchmark of 15–16 percent. Credit growth is expected to slow reflecting lower LTV ratios on vehicle finance (70 percent compared to 100 percent) and the temporary use of a 100 percent cash margin requirement on all Letter of Credits opened for vehicle imports (from October 30 to December 1, 2015). The government fiscal deficit expanded to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2015. While revenue increased by 1½ percentage points to 13.1 percent of GDP, this mostly reflected one-off measures and tax collections from a temporary surge in vehicle imports. Expenditures rose by 2.1 percentage points to 19.9 percent of GDP, on account of a post-election wage hike (0.8 percentage points), a higher interest bill (0.5 percentage points), additional spending on goods and services (0.5 percentage points), and an increase in Samurdhi transfers (0.3 percentage points). On the other hand, capital outlays were compressed to 4.7 percent of GDP—about 0.4 percentage points lower than in 2014. Public debt increased from 70.7 percent in 2014 to 76 percent in 2015—partly reflecting debt financing of the fiscal deficit, but also the impact of rupee depreciation on the stock of foreign-currency denominated debt. As of end-2015 there was also an estimated Rs 1.36 trillion (11 percent of GDP) in government and state enterprise liabilities (the latter—Rs. 1.28 trillion— accounting for about 94 percent of the total)—some of which is under a government guarantee (see Box 1). Four SOEs (Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), and Sri Lankan Airlines) account for the bulk of these obligations. The authorities’ official figures for capital spending and the fiscal deficit in 2015 were 5.3 and 7.4 percent of GDP, respectively. This reflects an accounting arrangement whereby cost overruns for capital projects amounting to Rs 62 billion or 0.6 percent of GDP (which were paid but not recorded in 2014) were recorded in the 2015 account, according to an estimate provided by the recent FAD TA mission.

Public Debt in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka: Public Debt, 2015 Central government debt Domestic Treasury Bills Treasury Bonds External Sri Lanka records public debt on a central government basis, but there are other quasi- fiscal obligations of significant size. As of end-2015, central government debt was 76 percent of GDP, consisting mainly of treasury bonds (30 percent of GDP), multilateral and bilateral debt (20 percent), and international bonds (9 percent). In addition, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were estimated to have outstanding financial obligations of 11 percent of GDP, according to government data. The government provides guarantees for part of SOE debt (3.4 percent of GDP). These guarantees are capped at 7 percent of GDP, stipulated by the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act.

The overall balance of payments deteriorated significantly in 2015 despite an improvement in the terms of trade. The current account deficit was contained at 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015—the same level as in 2014. A strong pickup in non-energy imports (notably vehicles), negative export growth , and flat growth in remittances more than offset a lower oil bill and robust growth in tourism receipts. Excluding oil, the current account deficit deteriorated from a surplus of $2.6 billion in 2014 to a surplus of only $691 million in 2015. An estimated windfall of some $1.9 billion from lower oil prices (and volumes) was largely consumed by a $1.4 billion in increase in non- oil imports, with consumer goods accounting for about 60 percent of the total. Notwithstanding a boost from a September swap arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for US$1.1 billion and a late-October issuance of a $1.5 billion sovereign bond, gross reserves declined from 87 percent of the ARA reserve metric in 2014 to 76 percent in 2015, with a drop in months of reserve cover (prospective imports of goods and services) from 4.3 to 3.8 months. The RBI swap was repaid in full in early March 2016, but a fresh swap line of $700 million was extended at the same time, and fully drawn by the CBSL at the end of March. The decline in exports followed lower commodity prices (notably for tea) and lower demand from the EU, Russia, and the Middle East, including for garment and apparel exports. The duration of the swap is three months, or until an IMF-supported program is approved. Page 11 Capital flows have also been a key driving force behind the deterioration in the balance of payments. The capital and financial account position has weakened due to foreign exit from government securities, lower FDI inflows, and slow implementation of externally financed public and private projects. Investor sentiment has worsened, reflecting global market volatility and concern over domestic policies. Equity prices on the Colombo All Shares Price Index (ASPI) dropped by about 6 percent in 2015. Sri Lanka’s spreads over the 5-year US Treasury have widened relative to other EM Asian countries since the beginning of 2015, reflecting the weakening of macroeconomic fundamentals and investor sentiment. Sri Lanka’s spread vis-a-vis the EMBI peaked at 490 bps on February 11, but has since dropped to about 380 bps—compared with 220 bps for emerging Asian economies. Tougher external conditions in the wake of China rebalancing and unwinding of unconventional monetary policies were not outside Sri Lanka’s past experience. However, spillovers were magnified by domestic imbalances, as evidenced by higher volatility around the two elections (January and August 2015), and the official budget passed in November 2015.

The rupee was held relatively steady during the first eight months of 2015— depreciating by only about 2 percent as the CBSL provided about $1.9 billion to the foreign exchange market. Following the August elections, the CBSL shifted policy to cease giving a daily reference rate, exit from daily intervention and allow the market a greater role in determining the value of the rupee—with the rupee depreciating by some 4 ½ percent in that month despite net intervention of an additional $517 million. Intervention resumed after a short period, with central bank net sales of another $856 million in the remaining months of 2015, and the rupee depreciating slowly by another 2 percent. After some signs of stabilization in February (when net CBSL intervention fell to $190 million compared to a peak of $460 million per month in July September 2015), market pressures resumed in March. At the beginning of 2016, gross international reserves were short of gross foreign-currency claims coming due in the year.

Central Bank FX Intervention (US$ million) CBSL FX net absorption Changes in foreign holding of govt securities The foreign exchange and government bond markets were volatile in March 2016— highlighting rigidities in both systems. Amid stronger market pressures, CBSL actions (including provision of another $437 million to the foreign exchange market) kept the spot rate virtually unchanged and pushed a greater amount of foreign exchange trading to the forward market. The daily average transaction volume in the spot market declined from US$20 million to US$11 million between January and March, while the total transaction volume in the forward market increased from $58 million to $72 million. This may suggest that moral suasion in the spot market has pushed a greater amount of foreign exchange trading to the forward market. High short-term volatility has also been visible, with the 3-month forward price jumping from Rs 146.5 per US dollar to 151.4 during March 28 30, before settling again close to Rs 145 per dollar. The government bond market also became volatile in late March, as the CBSL initially announced issuance of Rs 40 billion in treasury bonds, but instead issued bonds of Rs 80 billion at a higher rate than that prevailing in the secondary market. Financial soundness indicators for 2015 were generally favorable. Profitability has generally increased on the back of an increase in net interest income, and capital adequacy remains comfortably above regulatory limits. Interest spreads have widened as commercial banks raised their prime lending rates by about 150 bps since December 2015 (reflecting the tightening of monetary policy) while increasing deposit rates by only 25 bps. Vehicle financing accounted for much of banks’ loan growth in 2015 followed by other consumer related financing such as housing. The ratio of NPLs to gross loans declined to 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 4 percent in the third quarter because of growth in the overall portfolio of loans. Page 13
