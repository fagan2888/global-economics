Over the past year, the government has taken important steps to address the housing market, support indebted households, and implement pension and labor reforms . In particular, policies regarding mortgages have stabilized expectations and supported a pickup in housing prices and transactions. These and other reforms to strengthen the financial system and assist SMEs have helped boost confidence, increase policy certainty, and support the nascent recovery. To secure a robust recovery, it will be important to build on these reforms to reduce household indebtedness, enhance the resilience of the financial system, and improve the efficiency of the housing market . At the same time, accommodative macro policies and structural reforms to raise productivity, especially for smaller firms, should support the balance sheet adjustment and improve the economyâ€™s growth potential. The Article IV consultation focused on a comprehensive strategy for promoting orderly household deleveraging while supporting growth.
