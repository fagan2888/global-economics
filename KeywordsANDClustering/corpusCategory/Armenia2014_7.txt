EU financing is now unlikely and has been removed from the program’s macroeconomic framework The Fund-supported program incorporated EU macro-financial assistance (MFA) of $100 million in 2014–15, based on consultations with the European Commission (EC). However, in June, the EC informed the authorities that it would not pursue preparation of the MFA, as it considered Armenia’s financing needs to be moderate, rather than substantial, and conditions to be stable, rather than acute. The EC indicated that it would continue to monitor developments and stand ready to reconsider, if conditions deteriorate sharply. Accordingly, the EU financing has been removed from the program’s macroeconomic framework. The projected path of CBA reserves is now lower than at the time of program approval, but reserves remain well above standard import and debt metrics. The program is fully financed going forward, with firm financing commitments. Page 18 Staff and the authorities propose to drop two existing structural benchmarks. The December 2014 benchmark on amendments to the large exposures regulation was based on guidance that has been superseded. CBA regulations are already broadly in line with new Basel III guidance in most areas, and the central bank is assessing whether modifications are needed. The authorities also propose to drop a June 2014 benchmark that calls for memoranda of understanding between the State Revenue Committee and the Competition Commission (among other agencies) on information exchange, as they consider that an existing decree provides sufficient basis for enhanced collaboration.
