23. With the fading of the one-off factors that supported the 2014 outturn, the central government’s budget is expected to have been broadly balanced in 2015. The central government registered a 0.8 percent of GDP surplus in 2014, mainly due to expenditure restrain (1½ percent of GDP) and strong revenue collection due to concerted collection efforts of tax arrears resulting in unusually high one-off collections. While 2015 data are not yet available, revenue and expenditure trends thus far are in line with budget numbers. Revenue is expected to have decreased modestly from 2014 as one-off collections fade and nontax revenue decreased reflecting less income from transactions with third parties. Expenditure is expected to have remained flat, with higher transfers to the social security fund largely offset by lower capital outlays. Gross public debt declined slightly to 19 percent of GDP. The budget deficit is expected to turn to a ½ percent of GDP deficit in 2016. This deterioration is driven by an increase in capital investment by €10 million (0.8 percent of GDP) annually in 2016–18. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain close to ½ percent of GDP, as revenue is expected to decrease to 21¼ percent of GDP largely due to dwindling profits of public corporations, compensated by lower current expenditure due to continued containment of the public sector wage bill and an improved outlook for social security expenditure. On current policies, gross debt is projected to reach 21 percent of GDP by 2020, taking into account the €40 million CRSM recapitalization bond issued this year and the increased capital spending, but no further recapitalization needs. The mission advised that San Marino should gradually rebuild the fiscal buffers that served it well in the past. The planned additional capital investment in 2016–18 is appropriate, as capital expenditure, which generally improves productivity and hence growth potential, has fallen to unsustainably low levels during the recession. The resulting small projected 2016 fiscal deficit can be accommodated, given that growth is expected to be in line with medium-term forecasts and debt remains stable over the medium-term. Starting next year, once growth is entrenched, a modest adjustment of 1 percent of GDP (compared to the baseline without the additional capital expenditure, or 1¾ percent of GDP when compared to the baseline including the additional capital Balance (LHS) Revenues (RHS) Expenditure (RHS) San Marino: Fiscal Outcomes (Percent of GDP)Sources: San Marino MoF Pro jection Gross Public debt Govermment Cash Balances (€million, RHS) San Marino: Public Debt (Percent of GDP)Sources: Ministry of Finance Page 16 expenditure) over four years to reach a primary surplus of 1¾ percent of GDP by 2020 would put debt on a clear downward trajectory and create fiscal space to deal with shocks from the potentially large contingent liabilities looming in the banking system. Under such a fiscal stance, gross debt would decline to 15½ percent of GDP by 2020, and a contingent shock of 20 percent of GDP would be manageable with gross debt peaking slightly above 40 percent of GDP (text table and Annex II). If the economy were to fall back into recession, the authorities should let automatic stabilizers (e.g., unemployment insurance and wage supplements for underemployed workers) work fully. San Marino: Gross Public Debt and Primary Deficit under Different Scenarios Fiscal adjustment should focus mainly on expenditure rationalization combined with modest revenue increases. Over the last few years, the government has successfully controlled the public sector wage bill, which has shrunk by ½ percent of GDP. Nevertheless, it is still high and expenditure measures should continue to target the public sector wage bill—both through wage restraint and employment. In addition, the government has set up a working group to explore options for pension reform to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability. These expenditure measures combined could yield ¼ percent of GDP annually in each of the years 2017–2020, for an overall expenditure reduction of 1 percent of GDP. The introduction of the VAT system next year— for which the authorities have prepared draft legislation and consultations are ongoing—should go ahead as planned, and should be used to increase revenue by some ½–1 percent of GDP, by setting 201520162017201820192020Baseline (incl. capex) 1/18.821.821.621.521.521.4 Baseline+adj 2/18.821.520.218.917.315.5Contingent shock 3/18.841.641.541.741.742.0Contingent shock +adj 2/ 3/18.841.540.539.437.936.3Baseline (excl. capex)0.30.60.90.80.80.8Baseline (incl. capex) 1/0.3-0.20.10.00.00.0Baseline+adj 2/0.3-0.21.11.21.51.7Contingent shock 3/0.3-20.20.10.00.00.0Contingent shock +adj 2/ 3/0.3-20.21.11.21.51.7 source: IMF staff calculationsNotes: 1/ Additional capital expenditure of 0.8 percent of GDP startingin 2016 is included in the baseline.2/ Adjustment involves fiscal consolidation of 1% of GDP over four years, with 0.75% of GDPadditional revenue from the introduction of VAT in 2017.3/ Shock senario assumes a contingent financial liability shock of 20% of GDP. Primary Balance Public DebtSan Marino: Gross Public Debt and Primary Deficit under Different Scenarios(percent of GDP) Page 17 the average VAT rate somewhat higher than the revenue-neutral rate. Together with the revenue increase, this will create fiscal space of around ½–1 percent of GDP to finance planned capital expenditure of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2017 and beyond. Establishing access to external financing for the sovereign would help diversify funding sources and break the bank-sovereign link. Given the expected small size of potential financing needs, an external private placement or syndicated loan could be considered instead of borrowing on international capital markets. Establishing access to external financing would provide an important buffer to respond to shocks that could simultaneously raise borrowing needs and leave domestic banks unable to lend to the government. The current low international interest rates present a window of opportunity, as they limit the additional cost. In addition, an agreement on a contingent credit line from the Italian authorities would provide a welcome insurance against liquidity shocks. The government agreed on the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers. Public finances have stabilized after many years of recession and adjustment. Looking forward, the authorities see the need for further capital investment, and at the same time are committed to further fiscal consolidation to put debt on a downward path and be prepared for possible future shocks. They highlighted that their policies and the ongoing modest resumption of growth have already reduced the deficit and stabilized debt. To support the public pension system, the government obtained a parliamentary mandate to study reform options to ensure the system’s long-term sustainability. The authorities consider the introduction of the VAT in 2017 a priority, emphasizing this in public. However, they note opposition to the VAT system from service and domestic trade companies, whereas the export sector supports the change. Given this opposition, the authorities plan to set a revenue-neutral average VAT rate, and phase the VAT in gradually. The government views the public placement of the state bond to recapitalize CRSM as a step toward breaking the bank-sovereign feedback loop. Going forward they will consider external financing options.
