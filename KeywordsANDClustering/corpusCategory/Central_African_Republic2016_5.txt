Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to further build capacity to support and undertake major reforms. During the emergency phase, the authorities put in place an institutional framework to rebuild capacity, coordinate technical assistance, and monitor reforms undertaken in the context of the RCF. This framework will be strengthened to enhance donor coordination and leverage capacity building and technical assistance (TA) resources to maximize synergies and increase effectiveness. The authorities agreed to be part of the Capacity Building Framework (CBF) pilot project (Box 2), which they consider as a powerful tool to mobilize and coordinate timely TA and use it efficiently to ensure the success of their program (MEFP, Â¶30).
