Discussions focused on policies to advance the structural reform agenda while consolidating sound macroeconomic fundamentals and containing financial sector risks . Staff endorsed the authorities’ plans to address Paraguay’s critical infrastructure needs and improve public services, especially in transportation, electricity, and water and sanitation. Progress in these areas can and should be achieved without jeopardizing the strong macroeconomic position that Paraguay has attained. In that light, the mission discussed steps to further improve the macroeconomic policy framework and buttress its credibility, notably by establishing the FRL as a reliable fiscal anchor. To contain the risks from continued high credit growth, staff suggested close monitoring of riskier lending segments and targeted macroprudential measures, along with a further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework. The IADB’s country strategy for Paraguay (http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=38846631) discusses the country’s striking infrastructure gaps and lays out priorities for action.
