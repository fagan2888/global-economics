The year 2012 concluded the decade with the strongest average GDP growth on record in Uruguay and a remarkable improvement in living standards (Figure 1). Key drivers of Uruguay’s strong rebound from its 2002 crisis included important institutional reforms, large FDI projects attracted by Uruguay’s stable macroeconomic environment and business-friendly investment climate, and favorable external conditions. The result has been a strong rise in employment, real wages, and consumption. Poverty rates have declined sharply thanks to strong growth and active social policies (Box 1), and income inequality has also declined further since The main priority is to safeguard and enhance these gains by ensuring a smooth landing of the economy, and to bolster medium-term potential . 2012 saw slower growth and widening imbalances—a higher fiscal deficit and inflation, a strong real appreciation (boosted by portfolio inflows), and a wider current account deficit. The task ahead is to calibrate the policy mix so as to decisively tackle inflation, safeguard competitiveness, and facilitate a smooth landing in a less favorable global environment. The medium-term goals—to reinforce resilience to shocks and bolster potential output—are unchanged.
