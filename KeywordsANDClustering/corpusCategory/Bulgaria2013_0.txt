Bulgaria has effectively pursued policies to support macroeconomic and financial stability for over a decade, but income convergence with the European Union (EU) has been slow. The stabilization policies established in the second half of the 1990s and firmly implemented since have insulated Bulgaria well against shocks from the global financial crisis, turmoil in neighboring Greece, and recent domestic discord. However, Bulgaria remains the poorest EU member, with income levels about half the EU average. While this marks an improvement in relative terms (up from one-third in 2002), using WEO data the gap in absolute incomes has widened over the last decade.

The authorities have rightly emphasized the need to safeguard stability while developing a new paradigm for growth and job creation that does not depend on the extraordinary inflows that characterized the pre-crisis period. Adverse demographic changes, accelerated by emigration, add to the challenge. Progress will require addressing long-standing institutional and broader structural rigidities to enhance domestic competition, reinforce the rule of law, address infrastructure gaps, and strengthen human capital.
