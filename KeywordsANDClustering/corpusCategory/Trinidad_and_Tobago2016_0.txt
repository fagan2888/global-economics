Real GDP Growth, 2012Q1~2015Q3 (In percent, year-on-year) Trinidad and Tobago’s output has continued to shrink. Ongoing maintenance and further declines in gas and oil production are estimated to have driven energy output 4.7 percent lower (yoy) as of September 2015 (Figure 1). Combined with weak non-energy growth, real GDP declined an estimated 2.1 percent in 2015. Core inflation remained anchored at 2.0 percent yoy in 2015, while headline inflation fell to 1.5 percent (yoy). Unemployment remained low (3.4 percent in September 2015), in part as make-work programs continue to sustain employment. However, more recently, there has been a pickup in layoffs. r r Source: Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. Real GDP Growth (year-on-year) - Energy Real GDP Growth (year-on-year) - Non Energy Real GDP Growth (year-on-year) r r The long-standing current account surplus turned into a 5.4 percent of GDP deficit in (Figure 2). The reversal is mostly due to a sharp drop-off in energy exports. With energy prices having fallen some 40 percent during 2015, exports are estimated to have declined from US$11.8 billion in 2014 to US$9.1 billion in 2015. Relatively expansionary fiscal policy in FY 2014/15 (October-September), growth in consumer credit, and robust foreign direct investment (FDI) raised capital and consumer imports. After an overall balance of payments surplus in 2014, reserves declined US$1.5 billion in 2015, albeit to a still comfortable US$9.8 billion (13.4 months of imports). Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) assets increased by $212 million over the prior 12 months to US$5.8 billion in June 2015. The significant terms-of-trade shock implies that the real effective exchange rate has become more overvalued. Estimates using two methodologies under the EBA-lite framework indicate a sizeable real effective exchange rate gap: 23 percent using the Current Account model, consistent with the large current account gap of -5.6 to -7.6 percent of GDP, and 50 percent under the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Model (though the latter may be exaggerated due to ongoing measurement issues with headline inflation; Annex I). The terms-of-trade shock in 2015 explains some of the overvaluation. However structural impediments, domestic policy gaps relative to other countries and the appreciation of the US and US dollar pegged currencies (60 percent of trade) vis-á-vis the TT dollar are dominant contributors to the REER gap. The nominal exchange rate The participation rate declined from 62.0 to 60.3 percent from Q3 2014 to Q3 2015. The BOP data for 2015 was extensively revised in early 2016 by the CBTT to reflect (i) the incorporation of new data on goods exports and imports from the Central Statistical Office (CSO), (ii) introduction of new data sources, and (iii) correction of some large errors in the data. The large revisions in the BOP estimates will cause a structural break in the data for 2015. Revisions to 2011-2014 BOP estimates, to make them comparable to 2015, and 2012 to 2014 IIP data are anticipated by the third quarter of 2016. CARTAC’s technical assistance in 2015 and early 2016 has been instrumental in these developments. Page 8 has been closely managed by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) to stabilize the currency against the US dollar, as its de facto nominal anchor. Exchange Rate (TT$/US$, mid-market) The authorities began to depreciate the TT dollar in November 2015 amid continued widespread reports of foreign exchange (FX) shortages. The rate, which had been maintained within a narrow range of +/- about 1 ½ percent around TT$6.35/US$1 since late 2009, was depreciated by 3 ½ percent through early April 2016. The CBTT injected US$500 million to the market at end-October, 2015 and commercial banks were requested “to ensure all legitimate demands for FX are met (within a reasonable time), with priority accorded to trade-related transactions.” Nevertheless, reports of FX shortages, including for current transactions, soon reappeared. In the period since then (November through March), the CBTT has injected smaller amounts of foreign exchange, averaging US$86 million per month. In April, the government announced that the bilateral rate versus the dollar would not be allowed to depreciate more than 7 percent from its September 2015 level, leaving room for another 3.3 percent depreciation from that date. Fiscal policies in recent years have been pro-cyclical. Despite high energy prices, the budget remained in deficit, in part as non-energy tax bases were underutilized (or, regarding the VAT, undermined with expanded zero-ratings). Expenditures increased as a share of GDP, with transfers and subsidies (including for fuel) rising while capital spending has remained relatively flat. Accordingly, despite the windfall gains in energy revenues, the government debt-to-GDP ratio continued to rise while the assets of the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) grew only from 14 to 23 percent of GDP during FY2010-FY2015 (Table 2 and Figure 4), with only TT$4.5 billion of a cumulative TT$19.2 billion of energy revenues in excess of budgeted amounts being transferred to the HSF during 2010–14. The 2014/15 fiscal accounts were hard hit by the decline in energy prices. The deficit expanded to 4.7 percent of GDP, although it was contained from widening further by one-off revenues. The budget deficit had been targeted at 3.1 percent of GDP (GFS basis), based on oil prices The de facto exchange rate regime is official classified as a stabilized arrangement, but could be reclassified as “crawl-like” if the current trend of depreciation continues through June of this year. Central Bank of Trinidad & Tobago, Media Release No. 9/2015, October 29, 2015. These calculations are based on the Fund’s definition of energy revenues, which is broader than that used by the authorities in determining HSF financing, in that it includes, for example portions of personal income and corporate profits taxes that are thought to be closely economically related to energy sector activity. Page 9 of US$80/barrel and (Henry hub) natural gas at US$2.75/mmBtu. However, energy-based revenues fell short by 4.4 percentage points of budgeted GDP. While lower energy prices also reduced fuel subsidies, by ¾ of a percentage point of GDP, expenditures were hit by the unbudgeted costs of a multi-year public sector wage agreement. The authorities responded at mid-year with a “variance of appropriations,” which sharply limited expenditures on other goods and services. Capital expenditures of TT$7.2 billion also fell short of budget. Recourse was made to a number of “one-off” revenue measures, notably greater reliance on dividend transfers from the National Gas Company and an income tax amnesty that reportedly brought in an additional 0.3 percent of GDP in revenues.

Despite the worse-than-budgeted fiscal outturn, the increase in government gross indebtedness was limited by recourse to “one-off” financing. Asset sales, combined with an early loan repayment by a state-owned enterprise (SOE), provided TT$4.8 billion (3 percent of GDP) in financing, almost two-thirds of total requirements. The stock of arrears (especially for VAT refunds), estimated in the 2016 budget statement at TT$5 billion, was also used to help with financing difficulties. As a result, central government debt increased by only 2.0 percentage points of GDP, while external debt actually fell in nominal terms to US$2.1 billion (8.4 percent of GDP). The sharp fall in energy prices since the new government’s initial introduction of the budget is leading the 2015/16 deficit to surge. With a seemingly conservative US$45/barrel oil price assumption, the budget deficit was initially targeted at 7.5 percent of GDP on a GFS basis (1.7 percent of GDP using the authorities’ accounting convention). This was to be achieved through adjustments totaling over 3 percent of GDP, including tight expenditure control, lower fuel subsidies (in part through hikes in fuel prices), and revenue measures. Base broadening of the value-added tax The authorities’ budget target was 2.3 percent of GDP. However, this included privatization revenues totaling 0.8 percentage points of GDP, which are included as financing on a GFS basis. Continued excess domestic financial market liquidity required issuing additional short-term open-market-operation instruments, which are not included in gross debt. The proceeds of such bonds are placed in “frozen” government deposits, totaling 24 percent of GDP (end-September 2015). The authorities count asset sales totaling some 6 percentage points of GDP as revenues, instead of “below-the-line” financing. Page 10 (VAT), combined with a rate reduction (from 15 to 12½ percent), was expected to yield a net 2½ percentage points of GDP. The budget also continued to rely on above-average SOE dividends. In addition, the government announced plans to use US$1 billion of HSF assets for deficit financing. As energy prices fell further and VAT revenues fell short, the authorities announced additional measures in an April Mid-Year Budget Review (MYBR), aimed at containing further fiscal erosion . Energy price assumptions were revised down to US$35 per barrel for oil and US$2.00 per mmBtu for natural gas. The measures included mid-year cuts of 7 percent of budgeted expenditure, hikes in tobacco and alcohol excises and on excises and duties on large-engine automobiles, further fuel subsidy savings from additional fuel price increases, and, with effect from FY 2016/17, the introduction of a tax on internet purchases. However, even with these measures, given lower energy prices and weaker-than-expected economic activity, staff estimates the deficit could total almost 11 percent of GDP on a GFS basis. Deposit/Lending Spread Commercial Bank Deposit and Lending Rate and CBTT Repo Rate (In percent) The CBTT tightened monetary policy, but the transmission to the economy is unclear. Citing the need to mitigate potential capital outflows (in anticipation of “normalized” U.S. rates), the CBTT raised the repo rate 200 basis points over eight successive meetings, to 4.75 percent, before pausing in January 2016. This pushed lending rates higher, but given still ample, albeit significantly declining, system liquidity, deposit rates remain low, resulting in improved lending margins for banks. Private sector credit growth has been concentrated in residential mortgages and consumer credit, while business credit, which had finally shown signs of strengthening, began to taper off in 2015 (Figure 3). Median house prices remained relatively stable in 2015. Jan-14 May-14 Source: Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. Sep-14 Jan-15 May-15 CBTT Repo Rate Ordinary Deposit Rate Prime Lending Rate Sep-15 Jan-16 Banks remain strong despite the weakening economic outlook . The latest indicators (end-December, 2015) show no deterioration in asset quality, with non-performing loans (NPLs) below 3½ percent. In addition, capitalization remains high and balance sheets very liquid, despite recent reductions in excess reserves reflecting increased CBTT sales of FX. Though returns have declined, banks remain profitable with ROA and ROE at 2.5 and 18.2 percent, respectively. The ratio of specific provisions-to-impaired assets of 42.1 percent at end-December 2015 has been increasing, The Mortgage Market Reference Rate (MMRR), which commercial banks and their non-affiliated lenders are expected to apply, plus a margin, to all new and existing residential mortgage loans, increased by 75 basis points to 3 percent over the year (to end-March 2016). As of January 2016, banks’ real estate mortgage loan rates were 7.5 percent, unchanged since November 2012. Commercial banks’ excess reserves dropped from an average of TT$7.2 billion in December 2014 to TT$3.4 billion in December 2015. Page 11 but still falls well below the 79.2 percent five-year average prior to the global financial crisis (2003– 2007). Continued robust overall credit growth has been a source of risk for the overall health of the financial sector, although the recent slowdown, in line with the slowing economy, has reduced this risk (see Financial Soundness Indicator Map). Banks’ high liquidity and capital exceed prudential norms by significant margins, and provide an ample buffer against any uptick in degradation of loan quality, while CBTT stress tests show banks can withstand considerable levels of financial stress. Moreover, the banking system does not appear overly exposed to foreign exchange risk. Some financial reforms have stalled. Insurance legislation to improve regulatory oversight, strengthen prudential requirements, and enhance governance was passed in the Senate, but lapsed in the lower house. It is expected to be reintroduced in 2016. The Occupational Pensions Plan Act, Credit Union Bill and amendments to the Co-operative Credit Societies Bill also await drafting or reintroduction. Implementation of banking regulations to conform with Basel II, which began in 2014, is proceeding, along with the National Financial Crisis Management Plan and the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI) oversight project.

Page 12 The windup of CL Financial Group (CLF) has progressed. A final resolution plan for Colonial Life Insurance Company (Trinidad) Limited (CLICO) and British American Insurance Company (Trinidad) Limited, including phased payments to CLICO’s policyholders and creditors from the monetization of CLICO’s assets, was announced in March 2015. The government announced in April 2016 that CLICO’s shareholdings in MIHL, Angostura, Home Construction, and CL World Brands and its traditional portfolio of insurance policies and other assets would be sold or disposed of in 2016, with a view to repaying all legitimate creditors and policyholders in full. CLICO’s holdings in Republic Bank are to be disposed of in 2017. A plan to monetize assets held directly by CLF is to be announced in due course. The FX market has been experiencing long queues. Market participants reported a worsening situation in the last 18–24 months, with a wait time for most requests of over four weeks (and sometimes considerably longer) for their FX demand to be satisfied, including for making payments and transfers for current international transactions. External payment arrears to creditors have emerged, and some foreign suppliers have reportedly cut off credit lines to local importers. The CBTT’s intervention mechanism is targeted toward reducing market volatility, but by itself has proven insufficient to address the underlying FX imbalance problems. The CBTT manages the TT$ exchange rate mainly through its regulation of the maximum market sell and buy rates, and through FX provision, accounting for approximately one-third of the total market FX supply via discretionary, non-competitive allocations to licensed authorized dealers. The CBTT’s FX supply has been insufficient to satisfy bona fide demand, including demand for current international transactions at the exchange rate that is set within limits it determines. Recently, the CBTT increased the frequency of its interventions to approximately every two weeks for better volatility management, without increasing its total FX supply. The CBTT limits sales of its FX intervention funds to meeting only “trade-related” demand, and has encouraged authorized dealers to similarly prioritize sales of FX obtained from other sources. Progress has been made in improving the business climate. The previous government adopted a new bankruptcy and insolvency law, significantly shortened the time to start a business, streamlined trade clearance procedures and simplified property registration. A public procurement law was adopted, although the new government plans to reform it further. Efforts are now being made to improve the insolvency framework, improve trade facilitation and access to credit, and streamline company registration procedures. Government efforts to transition individuals from “make-work” programs to the private sector have thus far largely failed, although the Government, in Dealers’ maximum sell rate is set by applying a fixed margin over the intervention rate, which is the latest rate at which the CBTT sells FX to authorized dealers. Dealers’ maximum buy rate is set at the mid-rate for the prior day. The rates for the CBTT’s FX purchase from, and sale to, the government are set at the prior day’s mid-rate and the prior day’s average sell rate, respectively. “Trade related” transactions, however, do not include all current international transactions as defined under Article XXX(d) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and, accordingly, the priority sales do not cover payments and transfers for other current, but non-foreign trade, international transactions, such as interest and net income payments, loan amortization or direct investment depreciation payments, and family remittances. Page 13 its 2016 MYBR, has announced plans to reform these programs with a view to reducing financial support and making them more cost-effective. While data shortcomings continue to constrain staff’s ability to conduct economic surveillance, significant efforts are being made to remedy these shortcomings and discrepancies across data sources. The quality and timeliness of key macro-economic indicators had worsened in recent years due to insufficient attention and resources being provided in this area. However, more recently, the government has begun to make a concerted effort to improve data timeliness and quality. In particular, the new government has launched a process to transform the Central Statistical Office (CSO) into an independent National Statistical Institute, to be launched at the beginning of 2017 (Informational Annex).
