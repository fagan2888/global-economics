the past decade, the highest in Latin America. In 2011–12, real GDP grew at around 11 percent, driven by strong private demand, the implementation of an ambitious public investment program, and the Canal expansion project (see Figure 1). In 2013, despite continued support from public investment, growth declined to 8.4 percent, reflecting mainly a decline in Colon Free Zone ( Zona Libre de Colon , ZLC) activity—in part associated with the controls on foreign exchange payments in Venezuela, and the import tariffs imposed by Colombia on textile and footwear (see Chart 1)—and in Canal traffic. The strong growth performance unfolds against a backdrop of continued policy reforms, broadly in line with past Fund recommendations (see Box 1). Sources: Panama National Authorities. Re-exports to: Imports from: Venezuela USA Puerto Rico China Colombia Singapore Others Others GDP figures are being revised upward. In March 2014 the authorities started releasing preliminary figures for revised national accounts statistics for the period since 2007, which however are as yet incomplete. The upward revision to nominal GDP is between 5 and 8 percent, depending on the year. Unless otherwise noted, this Staff Report is based on the 1996- base national accounts statistics, the data officially available at the time of the staff mission. Chart 2. Panama: CPI Contribution (Percent change, yoy) Food and beverages Transport Consumer price index (CPI) Inflation is moderating, in part due to the deceleration of food and fuel prices, but remains higher than in trading partners (see Chart 2). Average headline inflation declined to 3.3 percent (yoy) in March 2014 from the 2012 average of 5.7 percent, while core inflation decreased only from O F Sources: Emerging Markets Economic Data (EMED) Database. In March 2014, Colombia moderately lowered the tariffs and indicated they would remain unchanged for two years. The revision encompasses changing the base year from 1996 to 2007 as well as enhancing the computation methodology, especially for the transportation, trade, financial, public, and household sectors. Page 6 5.1 percent to 3.5 percent over the same horizon. The contribution to inflation from components other than those associated with food or transport has become quite resilient, and there are risks that persistent inflationary pressures may feed into wage dynamics. Public and private wage inflation increased to 11.6 and 9.3 percent in 2012, from 4.5 and 4 percent respectively in 2011. In December 2013, the authorities announced an increase in the minimum wage (previously set in December 2011) by 13 to 27 percent depending on the type of job. In February 2014, the government announced a wage increase of up to 50 percent for school teachers, who comprise about 3 percent of the labor force. The 2013 fiscal deficit was 3 percent of GDP (or 2.9 percent when using the new GDP statistics), within the revised ceiling allowed under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) (see Figure 2). The large increase from the 2012 deficit to GDP ratio (1.5 percent) was due to a strong public investment program: revenue excluding grants of the Non-Financial Public Sector increased by 9.9 percent, while current and capital expenditures grew by 9.6 percent and 30.2 percent respectively. The contribution from the Canal Authority declined slightly, mainly owing to a slowdown in transit. In cyclically adjusted terms, the 2013 primary balance as a percent of GDP is estimated to have deteriorated by 1 percentage point. Public debt is on a declining path. The ratio of public debt to GDP (including external debt contracted for the Canal expansion) fell from about 66 percent in 2005 to about 41 percent in 2013 (see Figure 2, Table 8, and Annex II). Sovereign spreads have been in line with other main emerging markets in Latin America, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru over the past few years (see Figure 3). On April 22, 2013, Panama issued a US$750 million 40-year global bond with a coupon rate of 4.3 percent. At that time, all three rating agencies confirmed its BBB rating, one notch above investment grade, on par with Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. Since then, the spread rose by about 45 basis points (from April 2013 to March 2014). As part of the debt management strategy, in order to smooth the future amortization profile, in November 2013 the authorities bought back US$583.6 million of the US$962 million global bond maturing in March 2015 and replaced it with a combination of global and domestic bonds with longer maturity. To encourage the development of domestic capital market, the authorities have also increased local debt issuance: the domestic share of new debt issuances rose from less than 10 percent in 2009 to about a quarter in 2013. The current account deficit remains elevated, reflecting high public and private investment. The worsening of the current account deficit in 2013 (to 11.9 percent of GDP), however, mostly reflects the slowdown in exports (particularly Canal and related services) and an increase in The monthly minimum wage in Zone 1 (roughly corresponding to the urban area) was raised 27 percent from US$490 to US$624, and in Zone 2 (rural area) by 13 percent from US$432 to US$488. The new minimum wage should benefit about 270,000 workers, who constitute about ¼ of the working population. The 2013 SFRL deficit ceiling was raised to 3.1 percent from 2.7 percent, after approval of a supplementary budget to cover the costs of reconstruction related to the 2012 floods. For subsequent years, the ceiling then declines from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.5 percent in 2018. The 2012 deficit was revised from 2.1 to 1.5 percent of GDP, as only part of budgeted expenditures materialized in Page 7 Chart 3. Panama: Exports Composition (US$, billion) FDI reinvested earnings. The current account deficit is projected to remain high (close to 11 percent of GDP) in 2014 and 2015, and improve in 2016 when the Canal expansion should be completed. Exports remain well diversified: services account for the bulk of exports, and tourism and air travel account for as much as the Canal (see Chart 3). In October 2012, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the U.S. entered into force, while the FTA with Canada became effective in April 2013. An association agreement between Central America (including Panama) and the European Union entered into force in August 2013. An FTA with Mexico was signed in April 2014.

Buoyant FDI inflows are projected to continue to finance most of the current account deficit. The copper mining project is expected to bring about US$6½ billion over 2013–17, of which about US$1½ billion was already invested in 2013. Overall, the large negative international investment position (about 71 percent of GDP in 2012) corresponds mainly to a large inward FDI position (see Table 10), while both the assets and liabilities of the banking sector (including currency and deposits) amount to about 100 percent of GDP. The financial sector is Chart 4. Panama: Household Debt-to-GDP Ratio (In percent; data for 2012–13) generally healthy. Most local banks have a traditional business model with limited wholesale funding and are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid (see Figure 3 and Table 5). In recent years, overall credit to the private sector has grown in line with nominal GDP. The loan portfolio is balanced, with loans to the real estate and commerce sectors each accounting for about 25 percent of total credit. Due to the difficulties in the ZLC, growth in credit to commerce slowed from 23 percent in 2012 to about 3 percent in 2013, while growth in credit to construction, mining, real estate, and Official statistics currently report only small FDI outflows. However, such outflows as reported by recipient countries in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey are large. The authorities are working on reconciling this inconsistency.

In January 2014, the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) required banks to increase their provisioning for exposures to Venezuela (through ZLC) by about 1–1.3 percent of total capital. Interest rates remain at historically low levels, while household debt (at about 40 percent of GDP) is on the high side compared to other emerging markets (see Chart 4). The regulatory framework for financial sector supervision is being enhanced in line with FSAP recommendations (see Annex I). The authorities are applying risk-based supervision to most banks and expect to complete coverage by mid-2014. The SBP has adopted a regulation on credit risk management (Acuerdo No. 4, May 18 2013) and is working to enhance the countercyclical capacity of the dynamic provisioning component, which will become effective by end-2014. The recently approved Insurance Law enhances the independence and enforcement capacity of the Superintendency of Insurance (SSRP); the SSRP is making efforts to build its analytical capacity and upgrade regulations. The controversy around the recent intervention in a brokerage company by the respective supervisory agency revealed critical weaknesses in the enforcement of the regulatory framework for capital markets.
