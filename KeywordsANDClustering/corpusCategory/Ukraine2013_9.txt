Reforms An inefficient and opaque energy sector is weighing on public finances and the economy. Overall energy subsidies in Ukraine, on- and off-budget, are estimated at 7½ percent of GDP in 2012 with relatively well-off households capturing the larger share of the benefits. The very low tariffs for residential gas and district heating (20–30 percent of economic costs)––the main factors behind the high subsidies––encourage one of the highest energy consumption levels in Europe and lead to large quasi-fiscal losses by Naftogaz. They also exacerbate balance of payment weaknesses, discourage investment in domestic production, and breed governance problems. A large body of analytical work has prepared the ground for reform. Studies by Ukrainian and IFI (mainly World Bank) experts have brought clarity about the size and distribution of existing subsidies, developed proposals how to mitigate the impact of subsidy removal on the most vulnerable, and suggested means of effective communication of the need for reform to various Page 19 stakeholders. International experience suggests that these are the prerequisites for a successful reform. An ambitious and comprehensive energy sector reform, focused on eliminating Naftogaz’s operational losses, is an indispensable part of the macroeconomic adjustment package. Such a reform will reduce quasi-fiscal losses and budget subsidies, help in reining in the current account deficit, secure funds for domestic investment to achieve energy independence—a key medium-term objective of the authorities—and alleviate governance problems in the sector. Staff argued that the reform should aim at gradually eliminating Naftogaz’s operational losses over the medium term, limiting its deficit to the interest paid on its debt. For 2014, staff supported the authorities’ intention to cut Naftogaz’s deficit to 1¼ percent of GDP and urged the adoption of credible policies to this end. The reform should be based on a schedule of gradual, but upfront, meaningful, and broad-based tariff increases. Staff stressed that given the current very low tariffs, it would necessarily take a few years to reach full economic cost recovery. That said, the low initial position and the impact of the expected exchange rate adjustment on the cost of gas imports makes it imperative to start with meaningful gas and heating tariff increases for a broad household customer base in 2014 as also advised by the World Bank. This approach would strike the right balance between decisively moving toward cost recovery while minimizing collection problems along the IMF Policy Paper “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” January 2013.

Moreover, such policy would help reduce Naftogaz’s deficit and enable cuts of budget subsidies already in 2014, as well as strengthen incentives to save energy. Also, it would improve governance in the energy sector by reducing arbitrage opportunities for gas and heat sales––long exploited by vested interests––created by the existing tariff differentials across customer categories. To offset the effect of tariff adjustment on the most vulnerable and facilitate social acceptance of the reform, staff advised increasing targeted social assistance to the poorest 40 percent of households by expanding the existing means-tested programs (Annex VIII). Tariff adjustment would work best as part of a comprehensive energy sector reform plan to reduce the use and cost of energy and raise domestic gas output. To this end, staff advised (i) accelerating gas and heat metering and energy saving efforts, to complement the indispensable tariff hikes; (ii) diversifying gas imports toward cheaper sources; and (iii) create enabling environment––in terms of pricing and business climate––for attracting investment into domestic gas production. The authorities agreed that the energy sector is in need of reforms on multiple fronts, and announced their intention to cut Naftogaz’s deficit to 1¼ percent of GDP in 2014. However, they are reluctant to raise current gas and heating tariffs, despite considering options to this effect. In the heating sector, the authorities are working on a program to increase energy efficiency and cost transparency of the housing, utilities, and public sectors. In parallel, plans are being designed to convert in-kind energy benefits in cash by distributing voucher-like electronic cards to eligible households. Meanwhile, the authorities are working on raising domestic gas production from both conventional and unconventional sources and diversifying import sources, but notable gains from both approaches are expected only in the medium term.
