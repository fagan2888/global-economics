Adopt policies to increase fiscal space to be able to respond to slowdown in external financing. Take advantage of the current low international crude oil price environment to introduce reforms in domestic fuel pricing to ensure full cost recovery. The program is broadly on track (Table 1 of MEFP attachment I). Although budget execution was challenged due to shortfalls in tax revenue and donor budget support, all but one end-December 2015 performance criteria (PCs) were met. The PC on domestic primary deficit was missed by about 0.3 percent of GDP due mainly to tax revenue underperformance and the absence of corresponding expenditure cuts. The indicative targets on tax revenue (a floor) and on dobra money (ceiling) were missed by 0.7 percent of GDP and 16 percent above target respectively, due mainly to slowdown in economic activities and faster-than- programmed accumulation of net foreign assets and net government deposits respectively. The indicative target on pro-poor spending (floor), on the other hand, was missed marginally (2 percent lower than target) due to oversight difficulties which will be enhanced with the expansion of the electronic information management system (SAFEe) to all ministries and Page 18 government agencies. Corrective measures to address tax revenue under-performance have been introduced (see ¶ 20 and MEFP ¶ 12 and 13). The government has made progress in implementing structural reforms as planned (Table 2 of MEFP attachment I). In particular, the new bank resolution law was submitted to the National Assembly , and the two structural benchmarks related to improvements in the national accounts and consumer price statistics were also implemented. The policy resolve and commitment demonstrated so far are still needed, especially in an election year, to maintain momentum, and importantly, bring the benefits of reform and sacrifices made thus far to a broader segment of the population.
