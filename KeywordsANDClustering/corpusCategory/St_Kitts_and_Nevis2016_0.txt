St. Kitts and Nevis continues to enjoy broadly favorable macroeconomic developments. Over 2013-2015, the country recorded the strongest growth and fiscal results in the region, supported by surging inflows from its Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program that facilitated accumulation of substantial fiscal buffers. Under their home-grown program that concluded in July 2014, the authorities implemented substantial fiscal consolidation measures and a major debt restructuring, including an innovative debt-land swap with domestic banks that helped reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 68 percent, the lowest in the region. The structural reform agenda has achieved significant improvements in tax administration and public financial management. Additional efforts are needed to secure these gains, while enhancing the resilience of the economy to shocks, including from natural disasters, a sudden stop in CBI inflows, and domestic and regional financial sector risks.
