Overview. The Dominican Republic remains among the most dynamic economies in the region, having benefitted from a strengthened policy framework and external tailwinds. Growth averaged 5 ⅓ percent over the past two decades and 6 percent over the past two years, notably above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). After the severe banking crisis in 2003–04, policies have been strengthened with a cleanup of the financial system and reinforced supervision, the introduction of inflation targeting in 2012, and a commitment to fiscal responsibility. At present, the economy does not face significant imbalances, as inflation is low, fiscal deficits and debt are moderate, and the external position is broadly in line with fundamentals. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain: public debt is set to increase over the medium term and the tax ratio is one of the lowest in the world, reserves are below the level suggested by the Fund’s risk-weighted metric, and underperformance in the electricity sector and high poverty remain challenges. * Excluding China.

Following a period of close engagement with the IMF after the country’s 2003–04 financial crisis during which credit outstanding peaked at 387 percent of quota or 2.2 percent of GDP in 2011 post-program monitoring (PPM) was initiated in January 2013. With improved economic performance and a strong capacity to repay the remaining credit outstanding to the Fund, the PPM was terminated in October 2014 as outstanding credit dropped below 200 percent of quota. As of end-December 2015, the obligations to the Fund stood at 37.5 percent of quota. 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Banking and Financial Crisis Emergency Assistance Financial Crisis Global Stand-By Stand-By Stand-By Stand-By Stand-By 2nd 3rd 1st 4th 5th Reflecting the strengthened economic and policy performance, Standard and Poor’s raised its long-term sovereign credit rating to BB- from B+ earlier in 2014.
