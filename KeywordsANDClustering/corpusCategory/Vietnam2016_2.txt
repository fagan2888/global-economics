SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Healthy growth and low inflation provide a supportive environment for a second generation of reforms. A growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is a high priority while in the near term monetary policy can be put on hold. Allowing increased use of the new more flexible exchange-rate regime highlights the need to modernize the monetary policy framework. Efforts to recapitalize banks should be pursued and previous macroprudential policy easing unwound, while other elements of banking, SOE, and structural reforms to boost domestic-sector productivity are accelerated.
