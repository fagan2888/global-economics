Real GDP expanded by 3.2 percent in 2015 with the same growth rate expected for 2016, despite a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty. Almost 1.1 million jobs were created over the past two years. The rebound in private consumption, exports, and investment, aided by past reforms, has remained the main driver of growth. The European Central Bank’s accommodative monetary policy, low oil prices, as well as fiscal relaxation have also provided support. The current account is projected to record its fourth consecutive annual surplus. Private sector balance sheets have further strengthened, while public debt remains high at about 100 percent of GDP remains high. Real GDP growth is projected to moderate to 2.3 percent in 2017. </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15">Earlier reforms and confidence-enhancing measures have laid the ground for this rebound. In particular, wage moderation and greater labor market flexibility have helped the economy regain competitiveness and have contributed to strong job creation. Together with banking sector reforms they have made the Spanish economy more resilient.  </P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17">Nevertheless, unemployment remains very high at around 19 percent, with about half of the unemployed having been jobless for more than a year. Labor market duality is still widespread, and productivity growth is relatively weak. At the same time, high public debt, pockets of over-indebtedness in the private sector, and the still large negative net international investment position leave the economy vulnerable to shocks. </P><P MCID="18"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="19">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Directors recognized that decisive policies and structural reforms had contributed to the solid rebound. They noted that while the economy is now more resilient, adjustments are incomplete and structural weaknesses persist, including high unemployment, elevated public debt, and weak productivity growth.      </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Directors emphasized the need to preserve the past reform efforts and economic performance by sustaining the policy momentum and advancing structural reforms. They agreed that immediate attention should focus on priority areas where there is broad political support. These include implementing more effective active labor market policies to lower long-term and youth unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard overall public finances, and strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">In light of the elevated public debt and structural fiscal loosening in the past two years, Directors called for a resumption of gradual but credible fiscal consolidation to put debt firmly on a downward path. A growth- and job-friendly adjustment would need to rely more on indirect taxes, while shielding vulnerable groups. Directors commended the authorities for the revenue-enhancing measures adopted for 2017. They highlighted that advancing expenditure rationalization could also contribute to fiscal adjustment but should not come at the expense of targeted incentives for employment creation and productivity growth. Directors underscored the need to reform the regional fiscal framework with a view to improving regions’ incentives and capacities to comply with their fiscal targets. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">While recognizing the strong employment growth, Directors stressed that reducing the still very high unemployment, in particular long-term and youth joblessness, remains a priority. They welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen active labor market programs and encouraged further improvements, particularly through more effective coordination with regional governments. They recommended consolidating hiring subsidies into better-targeted schemes, particularly for low-skilled and long-term unemployed. Directors also called on the authorities to fully address the long-standing issue of labor market duality.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to enhance medium-term growth prospects, particularly by strengthening conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to grow and raise productivity. They called for faster implementation of the Market Unity Law, advancement of the liberalization of professional services, enhancing R&amp;D investment, improving access to non-bank financing for frontier innovation, and revisiting size-contingent regulations.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="11">2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

To further enhance the banking system’s ability to withstand shocks and facilitate sufficient credit provision as credit demand picks up, Directors encouraged continued efforts to ensure adequate provisioning, increase efficiency, boost non-interest income, and further increase high-quality capital. They looked forward to the upcoming 2017 FSAP which will review the overall financial stability architecture and provide guidance on further enhancing the financial system’s resilience. </P><P MCID="1">  </P></page>

The recovery is strong and imbalances are falling fast, aided by past reforms. External tailwinds and expansionary fiscal policy also buoyed activity and job creation. The economy is now more resilient but adjustments are incomplete and structural weaknesses persist. In particular, high unemployment, elevated public debt and shortcomings in the regional fiscal framework, feeble productivity growth, and the still large negative net international investment position pose policy challenges. </P><P MCID="5">Policies. Preserving past reform achievements is of utmost importance, but Spain needs to go farther if it is to sustain the dynamic economic performance. Given the fragmented parliament, immediate attention should focus on priority areas for which the reform needs and objectives are broadly shared: enhancing active labor market policies to lower long-term and youth unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard public finances, and strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity. Additional labor and product market reforms need to enhance such a strategy. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> Fiscal policy: Resumption of gradual fiscal consolidation would ensure that debt is firmly put on a downward path. A growth and job-friendly adjustment would need to rely more on indirect taxes.

The recovery is strong and imbalances are falling fast, helped by past reforms. Real GDP and employment growth remain well above euro area averages, despite a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty. Spain continues to reap the benefits of the major financial sector and labor market reforms taken during the crisis years, which in combination with external tailwinds and expansionary fiscal policy have buoyed activity. The Spanish economy has regained competitiveness, employment creation has been swift, and private sector balance sheets have continued to strengthen.  </P><P MCID="3">2.      But adjustments are not yet complete and structural problems persist. Unemployment, particularly long-term and youth joblessness, is still painfully high, while temporary work remains wide-spread. Without a boost to the low productivity of Spanish enterprises and greater efficiency and inclusiveness of the labor market, growth is set to ease and structural unemployment risks staying exceptionally high. At the same time, elevated public debt, lingering debt overhang in parts of the private sector, and the large negative net international investment position continue to leave the economy vulnerable to shocks.  </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">3.      Political fragmentation and reform fatigue have delayed fiscal adjustment and impeded deeper structural efforts. The priorities of the new minority government, which took office with a 10-month delay, are preserving earlier reform achievements and meeting short-term fiscal commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. However, rekindling the momentum for structural reforms and medium-term fiscal consolidation will be challenging (Appendix I), despite broad-based agreement on reform needs in areas such as regional public finances, active labor market policies (ALMP), and education and innovation policies.  </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7">607080901001106070809010011020002002200420062008201020122014201620182020Spain relative to ItalySpain relative to FranceSpain relative to GermanySpain relative to Euro areaGDP Convergence: Still a Large Gap(Spain's GDP per capita in PPP terms relative to other countries, percent)Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook.</P><P MCID="8">051015NPLsCorporate debt 2/ 3/Public debt 3/UnemploymentHH debt 4/Net IIP 3/200720132015Spain's Vulnerabilities in the Euro Area Context (Rank, 1=best, 16=worst) 1/ Sources: BIS; Haver Analytics; WBDI; national authorities; and IMF staff calculations.1/ Based on the relative ranking of euro area countries excl. the Baltics.2/ Ireland data excludes multinational enterprises debt. 3/ In percent of GDP. 4/ In percent of gross disposable income. </P></page>

Spain’s strong rebound has continued. Growth picked up to 3.2 percent in 2015 and stayed high in the first three quarters of 2016 at 3.3 percent year-on-year (y-o-y), though confidence indicators have continued to weaken amid lingering domestic political uncertainty (Figure 1). The rebound in private consumption, exports, and investment has remained the main driver of growth, buttressed by past structural reforms, robust growth in households’ gross disposable income, lower oil prices, the </P><P MCID="5">depreciation of the euro, and the ECB’s quantitative easing (Box 1). A relaxation of the fiscal stance has also provided stimulus to the economy. After returning to positive territory in September, headline inflation jumped to 0.7 percent in October and November (y-o-y), reflecting higher oil prices and moderate increases in food and services prices (Figure 1). </P><P MCID="6">5.      Job creation has remained strong but further reducing unemployment—especially for those long out of work—is a key challenge. Employment has been growing at more than 3 percent annually with almost 1.1 million jobs created over the past two years, supported by wage moderation and labor market reforms (see Annex I). Real unit labor costs have been growing at a modest pace (0.5 percent y-o-y in 2016: Q1–Q3). Temporary contracts still make up the largest share of new jobs (about 53 percent) even though there is some evidence that the share of permanent hires is picking up (Figure 2). Although the unemployment rate has declined by 8 percentage points from its peak three years ago, it remains very high at just under 19 percent; the rate for Spain’s youth is more than double that level. Almost 50 percent of the unemployed have been jobless for over a year, a large share of them being low-skilled and previously employed in the construction sector. Prospects for this group appear particularly grim, with unemployment exit rates significantly lower than the average and higher risks of poverty and social exclusion. In contrast, exit rates for the short-term unemployed (less than a year) have improved by more than 5 percentage points since 2013. The ongoing positive labor market dynamics have been critical in starting to recoup some of the fall in living standards and reverse the rise in inequality caused by the crisis (Box 2).  </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8">051015202530051015202530GRC 1/ESPPRTIRLITAFRAFINBELDEUNDLAUTPost-crisis peak level2016Q3Unemployment Rate in Selected EU Countries(Percent)Source: Eurostat.1/ 2016Q2 value is used.</P><P MCID="9">-4-3-2-101234-4-3-2-1012342010Q12011Q12012Q12013Q12014Q12015Q1SpainEuro areaSources: Eurostat and INE.Real GDP Growth(Quarter-on-quarter annualized percentage change)2016Q3</P><P MCID="10">81012141618202224262830313233343520052006200720082009201020112012201320142015Income inequality (Ginicoefficient) 1/Risk of poverty and socialexclusion (RHS) 1/Unemployment Rate (RHS)Source: Eurostat.1/ The income reference periodis the previous year.Income Inequality and Risk of Poverty and Social Exclusion(Gini coefficient and percent of total population)</P></page>

The private sector has further deleveraged while access to credit has improved. New bank lending has picked up in line with the strong economic recovery, in particular consumer credit, lending to agriculture, manufacturing, and non-real-estate services, but total credit growth is still negative (Figure 3). With private debt-to-GDP about 65 percentage points below its 2007 peak level, excess leverage is now concentrated mostly in a few corporate sectors for which the loan repayment capacity is still weak (construction and real estate) and in households (Figures 4–5). Improving profit margins since the crisis have helped the corporate sector finance new investment with retained earnings, along with more debt financing by large corporates. Households proceeded in rebuilding their net wealth positions and further reduced their bank debt. As a result, demand for loans is still weak, but credit supply—underpinned by a stronger banking system—is broadly supportive of the economic recovery, with financial conditions having eased further.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">7.      Bank balance sheets strengthened further amid new challenges. Asset quality has improved, but banks still hold sizeable nonperforming loans (NPLs), though much lower than in some EU countries. The NPL ratio stood at 9.5 percent for business in Spain at end-June 2016, which is 4.2 percentage points below its peak in 2013, despite the contraction of overall lending (Figure 6). Banks have also continued to build up capital buffers raising the regulatory capital ratio to 14.6 percent by end-June 2016. Although Spanish banks’ holding of common equity tier-1 (CET1) still lags that of European peers, they are generally less leveraged than their European peers thanks to the higher risk weight intensity. Reduced profitability over the four quarters (2015:Q3–2016:Q2) indicates that the operating conditions for banks have become more challenging, amid low interest </P><P MCID="3"></P><P MCID="4">0255075100125150175200036912152007Q22008Q42010Q22011Q42013Q22014Q42016Q2NPLs (percent of total loans)NPLs (2016Q1 = 100; RHS)Total loans (2016Q1 = 100; RHS)Nonperforming Loans (NPLs) of Banks in Spain, 2007-16Sources: Bank of Spain; and IMF staff estimates.</P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6">4060801001201401601802004060801001201401601802002000Q12002Q42005Q32008Q22011Q12013Q4Household debtCorporate debtCorporate and Household Debt, 2000-16 1/(Percent of GDP)Sources:Haver Analytics; and IMF staff calculations.1/ Based on total financial liabilities (excluding equity instruments), which includeborrowings and accounts payable.2016Q2</P></page>

However, more difficult economic conditions outside Spain—in particular in Latin America, Turkey, and the U.K. where large Spanish banks have subsidiaries—risk lowering group-wide profits and their contributions to group-wide capital (Box 3).  </P><P MCID="1">8.      The fiscal stance turned expansionary in 2015–16. Headline fiscal deficits have continued </P><P MCID="2">to fall to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2015 and a projected 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016. The 1½ percentage point reduction over two years has come on the back of the strong cyclical recovery and lower interest costs. In structural primary terms, the fiscal stance loosened by about 0.8 percent of GDP annually, reflecting mostly reductions in personal and corporate income taxes that had larger-than-anticipated impacts and overrun of non-entitlement expenditures (Figure 7).  </P><P MCID="3"> In 2015, the overall deficit significantly exceeded the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) target of 4.2 percent of GDP. In particular, regional governments (1 percent of GDP) and social security (0.7 percent of GDP) underperformed, but this was partly compensated by over-compliance of the central and the local (i.e. municipal) governments. At the regional level, capital, health and education spending outpaced the budget plan. Moreover, the reclassification of regional public private partnerships (0.2 percent of GDP) into the public sector, despite stricter reporting requirements introduced in recent years that were expected to prevent such surprises, revealed weaknesses in public financial management. The Council of EU Finance Ministers found that Spain did not take effective action to reduce its excessive fiscal deficit in 2015 but cancelled potential sanctions.  </P><P MCID="4"> For 2016, staff projects the fiscal deficit to decline to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, thus putting the new EDP deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP within reach. The projected deficit is nearly 1 percentage point higher than budgeted and envisaged in Spain’s April 2016 Stability Program (3.6 percent of GDP). Public debt remained high, at just under 100 percent of GDP.  </P><P MCID="5">9.      The current account registered another surplus. In 2015, the external current account surplus increased by ½ percentage point to 1.4 percent of GDP and it is expected to be around 2 percent of GDP in 2016. While non-oil imports accelerated further as domestic demand rose, the external surplus increased on the back of lower oil prices and interest rates.

Private sector deleveraging has driven most of the NIIP adjustment while external general government liabilities increased (Annex II). Given the need to sustainably strengthen the NIIP, the cyclically adjusted current account remained by some metrics up to 1 percent of GDP weaker than what would be consistent with medium-term </P><P MCID="4">fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and staff assesses that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is still about 5–10 percent overvalued (Appendix II).  </P><P MCID="5">Authorities’ Views </P><P MCID="6">11.      The authorities stressed reform achievements and progress made in reducing imbalances, both having contributed to the solid growth performance. They highlighted major improvements in employment, bank balance sheet cleansing, deleveraging, credit allocation, and external competitiveness. They emphasized that structural changes of the Spanish export sector are supporting sustained current account surpluses and, for the first time in decades, are considered to be compatible with strong growth. While broadly agreeing that the large negative NIIP remains a source of vulnerability, they stressed its gradual improvement over the last years as well as additional risk-mitigating factors such as equity holding and external debt held by the Bank of Spain.  </P><P MCID="7">202224262830323420222426283032342000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015ExportsImportsExports (non-energy)Imports (non-energy)Trade Flows(Percent of GDP)Sources: Bank of Spain; Haver Analytics.</P><P MCID="8">199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016 (e)-12-10-8-6-4-2024-12-10-8-6-4-2024-4-20246Growth and Current Account Balances, 1990-2016(Percent)Sources: IMF, World Economic Outlook and IMF staff estimates.Current account (Percent ofGDP)Real GDP growth</P><P MCID="9">-120-100-80-60-40-20020-120-100-80-60-40-2002020052006200720082009201020112012201320142015NIIP GGNIIP BdENIIP private sectorNIIP totalNet International Investment Position by Institutional Sector(Percent of GDP)Source: Bank of Spain.</P></page>

After a strong performance this year, growth is expected to moderate next year but stay well above the euro area average. Real GDP is projected to expand by 3.2 and 2.3 percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively, with domestic demand continuing to be the main driving force. Brexit is estimated to lower Spain’s real GDP by about 0.3 percentage point through 2018 via confidence and trade channels. As the external tailwinds dissipate and fiscal policy envisages some tightening in 2017, real GDP growth is set to ease. Small positive spillovers in 2017 from potentially higher global growth on the back of a possible US fiscal stimulus are expected to more than offset somewhat tighter financial conditions, with Spain’s 10-year government bond yields having risen by 19 basis points from end-October to end-December. Households are expected to further bolster their overall net wealth position and raise their still depressed savings ratio, implying a deceleration in consumption growth, though household deleveraging is set to moderate (see Box 1 in Country Report 15/232). Investment growth is also projected to slow with the unwinding of temporary factors but as the corporate debt overhang continues to shrink, prospects for investment and productivity growth should brighten somewhat.2 As a result, credit growth is projected to turn positive but remain subdued. A small positive contribution from net exports is forecast for this and next year as exports continue to benefit from improved competitiveness and better partner-country prospects while import growth should moderate in line with domestic demand and higher public and private savings. The current account surplus is projected to rise a bit this year and stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP, allowing for a gradual reduction of the NIIP. Inflation will likely pick up gradually to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2017, in line with the projected gradual recovery of oil prices and euro area inflation.  </P><P MCID="3">13.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. External risks to the outlook include weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies or a significant slowdown in the latter, as well as uncertainty about the potentially protracted negotiations of a post-Brexit arrangement (Appendix III). Moreover, the recent erosion of support for European institutions and increased protectionist sentiment in many economies is a risk to international integration, trade, and coordination. Slowing external demand would generally weigh down Spanish activity through the trade channel, while weaker macroeconomic conditions in Latin America would mostly be transmitted through financial channels, including through potentially reduced profits of Spain’s global banks (Box 3). Sharply tighter or more volatile global financial conditions could renew sovereign and financial sector stress via loss of market confidence, upward pressure on private sector lending rates, and resulting bank balance sheet effects, but the ECB’s policies mitigate against excessive financial volatility and private sector balances have strengthened.3 Domestically, reversal of past policy achievements could hurt market confidence, dampen investment, and weigh down medium-term growth prospects.

Fiscal Policy: Resuming Growth-Friendly and Inclusive Consolidation </P><P MCID="1">17.      The fiscal stance is set to tighten in 2017. The Council of EU Finance Ministers extended Spain’s deadline to exit the EDP by two years, with new deficit targets of 3.1 and 2.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018, respectively, calling for an annual structural adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP. Fiscal measures adopted by the government for 2017 will offset part of the CIT revenue decline, by tightening CIT credit and deductions for large companies, raise excises for tobacco and alcohol, and </P><P MCID="2">introduce a tax on sugar-based drinks. These measures are expected to yield 0.4 percent of GDP additional revenue (mostly from CIT). The government also plans to improve VAT collection, in particular by eliminating the possibility of deferment and fractioning of VAT debts, and reducing tax fraud via changes to VAT administration. If part of the expected revenue impact (0.2 percent of GDP) materializes, the EDP deficit target for 2017 is in reach. Though a budget for 2017 still has to be adopted, the </P><P MCID="3">planned fiscal adjustment is an important step to reduce the structural deficit and public debt. </P><P MCID="4">18.      However, a credible medium-term consolidation path has yet to emerge. The government projects the structural deficit to fall to about 1¼ percent of GDP by 2019 on the account of expenditure restraint, but no specific measures have been announced. Thus, under current policies, staff estimates the structural deficit to remain at around 2¼ percent of GDP over the medium term—still far from the structural balanced budget objective.4 Risks to reach fiscal targets are also considerable at the regional level, given the poor compliance track record (see SIP chapter III), weak enforcement of regional targets, and weak market discipline related to support via the regional liquidity mechanisms (which lowered the regions’ interest payments by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2015).  </P><P MCID="5">19.      Fiscal space is limited and remaining fiscal vulnerabilities demand gradual but steady and well-specified fiscal adjustment. Under current policies, both gross and net debt ratios are projected to remain elevated over the medium term at around 95½ percent and 80 percent of GDP, respectively, despite the favorable interest-growth differential, thus limiting fiscal space for cyclical policy responses to shocks. Gross funding needs are still high at about 18 percent of GDP in 2017. The fiscal outlook faces risks, particularly from policy implementation shortfalls, potential negative growth shocks, and the realization of contingent liabilities. For example, in a growth shock scenario with two consecutive years of recession, debt levels would be pushed near 110 percent of GDP (11 percentage points higher than in the baseline projection) and annual gross financing needs above 22 percent of GDP in 2018 (Appendix IV).

For instance, an annual adjustment of the structural primary balance of about 0.5 percent of GDP beyond 2017, and a multiplier of 0.6 (assuming revenue-based measures), would lower the debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points in 2021 compared to the baseline (Figure 7). Such an adjustment pace would strike an appropriate balance between preserving growth and ensuring public debt sustainability, while simultaneously lowering the sovereign-bank nexus (Annex II) It would also be consistent with the latest EC recommendation and with reaching structural balanced budget in five years, close to the target date set for meeting national rules.  </P><P MCID="1"> Most of the medium-term adjustment will need to come from higher revenues and should also create space to support greater inclusiveness and employment creation. While there is some room for spending restraint and rationalization, the public primary spending-to-GDP ratio is already relatively low compared to those of EU peers. So far, nearly two-thirds of the adjustment (5½ percent of potential GDP) has come from spending measures. And the expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline by another 2½ percentage points over the medium term under current policies, as expenditure is envisaged to rise only in line with the  </P><P MCID="2">GDP deflator and thus fall relative to nominal GDP (according to the latest Stability Program). With total medium-term adjustment needs of 2¼ percent of GDP for structural balanced budget by 2021, priority should be given to the least distortive revenue measures that raise VAT collections, tackle the remaining inefficiencies in the tax system, and increase environmental levies or excises. Such revenue measures also have low multipliers, thus limiting their negative short-term impact on economic activity.

Without bold reforms the regional financing framework remains a risk for the achievement of fiscal targets. The last electoral cycle was a first true test for the fiscal governance framework adopted in the 2012 Budget Stability Law reform, and it exposed old and new fault lines, in particular of the sub-national fiscal regime.

The authorities are committed to achieving the 2017 deficit target and agreed with the need to improve regional public finances. They considered that the adopted measures will deliver at least ½ percent of GDP structural adjustment, enough to reach the 3.1 percent of GDP deficit target. While the authorities generally agreed on the need for reducing the deficit and debt in the medium term in order to strengthen the resilience of the Spanish economy, they also stressed that the pace and composition of the fiscal adjustment should not weaken the momentum of growth and job creation. They stressed that the approach set out in the Draft Budgetary Plan for 2017 would allow for a progressive reduction in the structural deficit, including through improved fiscal compliance and the application of the spending rule, which would avoid the need for future tax hikes. Regarding the system of regional public finances, the authorities noted that fundamental reforms were necessary, particularly to enhance fiscal prudence, but the complexity of the issues would require strong political commitment, beyond the broad consensus on the reform needs, if progress was to be made. They also suggested that stricter enforcement of corrective measures introduced in the 2012 Budget Stability Law had started to improve the fiscal compliance of some regions and mitigated moral hazard risks.  </P><P MCID="4">B.

Reviewing the effectiveness of the current toolkit of ALMPs, for example as part of the OECD peer review exercise, could guide the reallocation of resources to the most promising programs and development of new alternatives in line with the most successful programs in other EU countries. Specifically, profiling of job seeker’s characteristics should be strengthened to provide more personalized assistance programs, and cooperation between the public employment service and private job-placement agencies will need to be improved for better outcomes of customized programs. Improving and modernizing training, apprenticeship, and education programs, including by better aligning them to current labor market needs, would help reduce skill mismatches, especially for low-skilled youth and individuals formerly employed in the construction sector. In this respect, reducing the high share of early school leavers is a key challenge. Making effective use of—and potentially enhancing—the EU’s Youth Guarantee schemes could support the employability of low-skilled youth, too. At the same time, the ties between active and passive policies could be strengthened, for example by strictly enforcing the requirement of the verification of an active job search and participation in activation programs to receive unemployment benefits.

This could be tackled by, for example, simplifying the menu of contracts to choose from, while effectively reducing the employment protection gap. One option is to introduce a single open-ended contract with no ex-ante time limit and severance payments that increase gradually with tenure. This could co-exist with separate contracts that account for the specific needs and costs related to training staff and employment in sectors with high seasonal turnover (e.g., tourism and agriculture). An alternative is to gradually introduce the Austrian ‘backpack’ model, under which entitlements to severance payments acquired in one job can be carried to subsequent jobs, so that severance payments grow with tenure regardless of contract type. In the meantime, the persistent legal and administrative uncertainties that hamper the effectiveness of labor market reforms and affect open-ended employment should be addressed. In particular, a number of formal requirements for collective dismissals and the possibility of nullifying the dismissal on formal grounds have been associated with high cost of annulled dismissals on grounds of procedural mistakes. Simplifying the list of possible causes for nullifying a dismissal and differentiating the corrective actions between annulments based on procedural and substantial grounds would mitigate legal uncertainties that have served as disincentives to open-ended contracts.  </P><P MCID="1">24.      Enhanced flexibility to set working conditions, especially in SMEs, is also critical. Ensuring that wage dynamics reflect differences in firm- and sector-specific conditions would promote a reallocation of resources toward more productive sectors, boost aggregate productivity and income, and reduce structural unemployment. The labor market reforms included steps in this direction: prioritizing firm-level agreements over higher-level ones; making it somewhat easier for firms in economic difficulties to ‘opt-out’ from higher level agreements; and limiting ultra-activity (the period during which an expired agreement would remain valid). However, the reform has not been able to promote a substantial change in the structure of collective bargaining. Wage flexibility generally improved, but the incidence of firm-level agreement has not increased significantly. Firm-level agreements remain especially unusual for SMEs, and ‘opting-out’ is the only possibility of wage adjustment for these firms, but only based on agreements with workers’ representatives, as the procedures for resolving potential conflicts associated with ‘opt-outs’ remain excessively demanding. Enhancing the flexibility at the firm rather than sectoral-regional level could be facilitated by eliminating the automatic extension of negotiated working conditions to all firms in the corresponding sector, for example by strictly verifying the thresholds of unions and employers’ representativeness.   </P><P MCID="2">Authorities’ Views </P><P MCID="3">25.      The authorities emphasized the importance of continued job creation and the need not to reverse the 2012 labor market reforms, while recognizing scope for some fine-tuning.

The authorities stressed that there is broad political consensus that enhancing the effectiveness of ALMPs is critical, with efforts already underway, such as improving the incentive alignment with the regional governments and private sector partners.

Therefore, an expert group will first develop policy options before engaging in a new dialogue. As regards the collective bargaining process, the authorities noticed that the labor reforms have given firms greater flexibility to adapt to their differentiated business needs, and the easier opting out has served as a disciplining tool, despite its muted uptake so far. Nevertheless, the issue of greater representativeness to conclude collective agreements with general effects could be explored over the medium term. The authorities stressed that their immediate focus is on preserving reform achievements, in particular in the context of the recent decision on temporary replacement workers by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  </P><P MCID="1">C.   Structural Reforms: Boosting Firm Productivity and Growth </P><P MCID="2">26.      Spain’s weak productivity remains a core medium-term challenge. A large part of the recent improvement in total factor productivity (TFP) growth was a result of drastic labor shedding and exit of low-productivity firms during the crisis. The reform agenda initiated in 2012 is likely to keep TFP growth at slightly above ½ percent over the next five years, implying that potential growth will rise gradually but not surpass 1½ percent without further reform efforts. Spain’s corporate landscape, with many small firms that tend to be less productive, innovative, and export-oriented than European peers, is behind this phenomenon (Figure 9). At the same time, significant within-sector heterogeneity in firm productivity points to inefficient resource allocation.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">27.      A number of factors weigh on firm growth and productivity. Staff analysis finds that product market regulation, in particular in more tightly-regulated sectors, has weighed on TFP growth. Moreover, different regulatory practices across regions, leading to an uneven business environment, have limited the capacity of firms to benefit from larger markets and exploit economies of scale. Size-dependent rules and regulations, including past tax incentives to SMEs, have also lowered firm productivity growth. Finally, the relatively high debt-to-asset ratio, by constraining access to finance and investment, has held back firm productivity and growth, in particular, for SMEs that tend to have weaker financial position compared to other firms (second chapter of SIP). Survey results corroborate these empirical findings.  </P><P MCID="6">-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.01971-791980-891990-992001-072009-15SpainGermanyFranceSpain: Medium-Term Productivity Growth Challenge (Growth in total factor productivity in percent)Sources: European Commission, Haver Analytics, and IMF staff calculations. </P><P MCID="7">0.00.40.81.21.62.00.00.40.81.21.62.0ITAESPPRTFINDEUAUTBELFRAResource Misallocation 1/(Average over 2000-13)Sources: RES ORBIS data and IMF staff calculations.1/ See Hsieh and Klenow (2009), “Misallocation and Manufacturing TFP in China and India,” Quarterly Journal of Economics. The authors decompose the logarithm of sectoral TFP into the difference between the logarithms of the “clean” TFP, i.e. TFP that would exist in a sector without factor market distortions, and a measure of resource misallocation. Misallocation is proxied by the variance of the logarithm of the total factor revenue productivity of a firm in a specific sector, adjusted by the price elasticity of demand in the same sector. For illustration, imagine a two firm economy, where only one of the firms faces capital distortions, e.g. capital subsidies. Removing the distortion and reallocating the same amount of capital across all firms (so as to equalize their marginal products of capital)would increase the aggregate output. This would remove the firm-level distortion and also increase sectoral TFP, since the economy wouldproduce more with the same inputs.</P></page>

The authorities broadly agreed with the main obstacles to firm-level productivity growth and the proposed policy options. In particular, they shared the need to improve the regulatory environment and enhance competition by faster implementation of the Market Unity Law. While the authorities concurred with the benefits from liberalizing professional services, they stressed the importance to advance this agenda also at the EU level.

Financial Sector: Continue Strengthening Capacity to Support Growth </P><P MCID="5">30.      Continued promotion of banks and borrowers’ resilience is a critical part of the economic recovery. Due to better asset quality, stronger capital and funding positions, and reduced debt overhangs, the system is closer to putting most of the crisis legacies behind it.

Continued efforts to strengthen banks’ capital and funding positions will enhance the </P><P MCID="2">banking system’s ability to support economic expansion and withstand shocks. It remains important to encourage banks to increase high-quality capital through retained earnings. Additional capital would help ensure sufficient credit provision to financially-sound corporates and households as credit demand picks up. At this stage near-term supply constraints appear unlikely, but bolstering banks’ capital would be prudent to safeguard financial stability and ensure adequate capital in light of regulatory initiatives.

Adjusting to profitability pressures is a key challenge, especially in the current macro-financial environment. Similar to other European economies, banks’ profitability in Spain is currently well below the pre-crisis level, with the return on equity lower than the cost of capital. Profitability has been stable in the past year, as for business in Spain reduced net interest and other income has been offset by falling impairment costs. The more difficult domestic and global operating conditions, in particular in a low interest rate environment, will put pressure on banks’ cost structure and business models. Achieving greater efficiency, in particular since Spanish banks still rely on a larger branch network than European peers, further reducing operating expenses, and raising non-interest income will be central to addressing the profitability challenge.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">4567845678101112131415Tier-1 captial (in percent of total exposures)Common equity tier-1 capital (in percent of risk weighted assets)Capital Adequacy and Leverage, June 2015 (Based on transitional definition)EU average: 5.0 percentEU average: 12.8 percentStronger capital buffers, and less leverageSources:EBA, 2015 Transparency Exercise; and IMF staff estimates.</P><P MCID="10">-3.0-2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.5-3.0-2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52007200820092010201120122013201420152016H1Business in SpainConsolidated operationsProfitability of Spanish Banks, 2007-16 1/(Net income in percent of average total assets)Sources: Bank of Spain; IMF, Financial SoundnessIndicators Database; and IMF staff calculations.1/ For banking business in Spain, the aggregate figure of net income in 2011 and2012is amplified by the segregation process of savings banks' business to newly-created banks.

Efforts to further improve access to finance for SMEs should continue. Access of Spanish firms to non-bank (typically equity) financing for frontier innovation, in particular, is low </P><P MCID="1">compared to their European peers. This suggests the need to step up ongoing efforts to increase market-based financing for SMEs, including via alternative exchanges, venture capital, and securitization. At the same time, the ongoing program providing guarantees and direct financing through Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), a state-owned financial institution, remains highly relevant for financing of new firms, with its lending at more favorable conditions now more concentrated in tenures beyond three years. The efforts have started to be complemented by European efforts, including by </P><P MCID="2">guarantees extended under the Juncker plan. </P><P MCID="3">35.      Three items under Spain’s financial sector reform remain to be completed: the divestment of public ownership in two banks and the liquidation of real estate assets owned by the Asset Management Company (SAREB). The framework for savings banks and banking foundations is now fully in place, and requires banking foundations either to divest relevant credit institutions or to set up reserve funds. The legal challenge related to the 2011 IPO of Bankia has been addressed, removing the deadlock for further privatization. However, the plan by the Spanish Resolution Authority (FROB) to sell its stakes in Bankia/BFA and BMN has stalled due to market conditions and political uncertainties, with the new government extending the deadline for the sale of both institutions by two years. FROB has recently hired a consultant to explore the option of merging the two institutions before a sale. At the same time, SAREB reduced its portfolio more slowly than planned (by 15 percent or about €8 billion) in the first three years due to difficult market conditions, but the recovery of the real estate market should bolster future sales. SAREB again registered a loss in 2015, following the adoption of the new accounting rule that requires appraisals of underlying collaterals in all loan books to properly reflect marking-to-market. The loss significantly eroded its capital and resulted in a conversion of subordinated debt into equity, with minimal impact on exposed banks given provisions made already. </P><P MCID="4">36.      The macroprudential policy framework remains to be fully put in place. The Bank of Spain has employed macroprudential powers, setting the amounts of countercyclical capital buffers (at zero) and capital surcharges for systemic banks, but the national macroprudential authority has not been established. Given the financial cycle, there are no imminent systemic risks in the cyclical dimension.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment on the recent progress and remaining challenges in the financial sector. The authorities stressed that the positive trends in the banking system were the outcome of the decisive financial sector reform, including recapitalization and balance sheet cleansing. They highlighted the progress made in NPL reduction over the last years and considered this pace to be appropriate. The Bank of Spain has continued to ensure adequate provisioning and forced weak banks to take additional measures, as needed, to address legacy asset problems. The authorities considered that going forward, low profitability would be the main challenge for banks, as in virtually all other European banking systems. They viewed banks as being well-positioned to handle forthcoming regulatory changes and supported the finalization and implementation of pending financial reforms. The authorities are committed to develop the macroprudential framework. </P><P MCID="3">STAFF APPRAISAL</P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">39.      The Spanish economy has continued its impressive recovery and strong job creation. Real GDP and employment growth have outpaced the euro area average despite a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty. The current account is projected to record its fourth consecutive annual surplus. And private sector balance sheets have further strengthened. </P><P MCID="6">40.      Earlier reforms and confidence-enhancing measures have laid the ground for this rebound, and they need to be preserved.

Together with banking sector reforms they have made the Spanish economy more resilient. Reversing policy achievements could hurt market confidence and weigh on medium-term growth prospects. </P><P MCID="7">41.      Despite considerable progress, adjustment is still incomplete and structural problems persist. Far too many Spaniards are still without employment and many have been jobless for years. Together with still pervasive labor market duality this has raised social exclusion, inhibited human capital investment, and served as a drag on productivity. Lowering structural unemployment and raising medium-term potential growth above the estimated annual 1.5 percent remain key challenges. At the same time, high public debt, pockets of over-indebtedness in the private sector, and the still large negative net international investment position leave the economy vulnerable to shocks.  </P><P MCID="8"></P></page>

Maintaining high job-rich growth calls for a comprehensive medium-term strategy. Preserving past reform achievements is of utmost importance, but it cannot by itself sustain the dynamic economic performance. To advance the structural agenda, immediate attention should be given to those priority areas for which there is a commonly shared view on reform needs and objectives, though not necessarily on the preferred policy tools: enhancing ALMP to lower long-term and youth unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard public finances, and strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity. Going forward, additional labor and product market reforms need to enhance such a strategy. </P><P MCID="1">43.      Resumption of gradual fiscal consolidation would ensure that debt is firmly put on a downward path. Building on the large fiscal measures adopted over 2010–13, adjustment can take a more measured pace but should be steady and be underpinned by well-defined policy actions. An annual adjustment of the structural primary balance of about 0.5 percent of GDP would bring the structural fiscal deficit into balance in five years and markedly lower the debt ratio. The pace would strike an appropriate balance between preserving the economic recovery and mitigating fiscal risks.  </P><P MCID="2">44.      A carefully designed adjustment can be growth and job-friendly. In particular, Spain has room to raise revenues. Gradually reducing VAT exemptions as well as raising excise duties and environmental levies would bring revenue collection more in line with that of European peers. On the expenditure side, room for further efficiency gains could be best gauged by conducting thorough expenditure reviews—in particular in health and education. At the same time, it will be important to properly shield vulnerable groups and enhance the efficiency of expenditure programs that directly support employment and growth, such as ALMP and public research and development spending.  </P><P MCID="3">45.      Without reforms, the regional financing framework remains a risk for public finances. Reforms should aim to improve regions’ incentives to comply with fiscal targets while accounting for their different economic capacities to do so. This calls for more automatic and stricter enforcement of targets and providing regions with greater power to mobilize their own revenues. And finally, the introduction of performance-based transfers could be considered to strengthen regions’ incentives to advance critical reform areas, such as the implementation of the Market Unity Law and ALMP.  </P><P MCID="4">46.      Reducing unemployment, in particular long term and youth joblessness, remains a key challenge. Despite recent efforts, the limited effectiveness of ALMP calls for urgent improvements, particularly though better coordination with regional governments. The range of hiring subsidies could be consolidated into better-targeted schemes, particularly for the low-skilled and long-term unemployed. At the same time, the long-standing issue of labor market duality is still to be addressed. Allowing firms more control and flexibility over working conditions is also critical to enhance the functioning of the labor market. </P><P MCID="5">47.      The current cyclical recovery is the right time to get a high pay-off from structural reforms. In particular, three types of policies can help raise the low productivity of Spain’s many SMEs.

At the same time, like other European banking systems, Spain’s banks face challenges arising from the low profitability environment and new regulatory initiatives.

What Has Been Driving the Recovery? </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">A combination of temporary tailwinds and structural reforms has driven the strong recovery of the Spanish economy. Beginning in mid-2013, the rebound followed major labor market and banking sector reforms as well as falling long-term interest rates but otherwise still weak external conditions, which have since improved.  </P><P MCID="3">The stronger-than-anticipated rebound was largely driven by temporary factors. At 3.2 percent in 2015, real GDP growth exceeded staff’s (and consensus) projection in the 2014 October WEO by 1.5 p.p. A decomposition of the growth surprise reveals that external tailwinds and fiscal expansion account for the bulk of it.  </P><P MCID="4"> The decline in oil price and interest rates explains about two thirds of the better growth outturn, each contributing about ½ p.p. Compared to the projection in the October 2014 WEO, oil prices dropped by some 34 percent and long-term interest rates by about 100 bps.1 </P><P MCID="5"> The impact of weaker euro in combination with wage moderation (5 percent real exchange rate depreciation, unit-labor-cost based) was broadly offset by external headwinds from weaker growth in the euro area and the resulting softer foreign demand for Spanish exports (-¼ p.p.). </P><P MCID="6"> A looser-than-projected fiscal stance (structural primary impulse of about 0.8 percent of GDP) provided an additional boost of about 0.4 p.p. </P><P MCID="7"> The remaining part of the growth surprise (about 0.2 p.p.) can be attributed to other factors, such as stronger confidence effects of structural reforms. </P><P MCID="8">For 2016, growth will likely exceed earlier staff projections by 0.6 p.p. of which two thirds can be attributed to a looser than expected fiscal stance and most of the rest to stronger foreign demand. </P><P MCID="9">At the same time, structural reforms, initiated in 2012, have made a difference. A simple benchmarking exercise suggests that structural measures adopted so far could boost potential output by about 2½ percent over five years. Put differently, structural reforms are estimated to add annually about ½ percent to potential growth over a five-year horizon. This is reflected in staff’s baseline projections.  </P><P MCID="10"> The labor market reforms explain close to half of the total growth impact from structural reforms. The reduction of the labor tax wedge, the 2012 reform of unemployment benefits and revisions to employment protection, combined with moderate wage growth over the last few years, are estimated to boost potential output by 1.1 percent over five years. </P><P MCID="11"> Efforts to make the tax system more </P><P MCID="12">growth-friendly by increasing its reliance on indirect taxation, and pension reforms are estimated to boost output by close to 1 percent over the medium term. </P><P MCID="13"> Productivity enhancing reforms (the 2013 approved Market Unity Law and the 2012 retail trade sector reforms) are projected so far to raise potential output by about 0.4 percent in the medium term.  </P><P MCID="14">___________ </P><P MCID="15">1 The impact estimates use oil price elasticities from the Bank of Spain (Annual Report, 2015), and the authorities’ REMS model for the effect of lower long-term interest rates (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, 2016). </P><P MCID="16"></P><P MCID="17">Product market reforms0.4The market unity law (Dec 2013) 1/0.2The retail reform (2012) 1/0.2Labour market reforms 1.1The 2012 reform of unemployment benefits 1/0.3The EPL reduction0.3The labor tax wedge reduction0.5The 2013 pension reform 1/0.2The reducion of the share of direct taxation0.7Total GDP Impact2.4(Impact on the level of potential GDP after 5 years, percent)Sources: EC (2016), OECD and IMF staff calculations.Table 1.

Inequality and Poverty in the Aftermath of the Crisis </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Income inequality and risks of poverty or social exclusion increased markedly with the global financial crisis on the back of a dramatic fall in employment, which affected young, unskilled, and temporary workers disproportionally. Measures to address duality and increase the employability of long-term and young unemployed are a policy priority to reduce risks of social exclusion among vulnerable groups.  </P><P MCID="3">The swift job creation since 2014-15 has started to dent the rising risks of poverty and social exclusion. But the benefit of the recovery has been uneven across generations and levels of education. Especially the employment of the young und low-skilled workers has lagged behind, making policies that improve their employability a priority.  </P><P MCID="4">As a result of the crisis, social indicators deteriorated sharply. The number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion increased by more than 23 percent between 2007 and 2015 in Spain. Low-skilled workers, youth, and immigrants have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, income inequality also deteriorated markedly, with the Gini coefficient rising by 2¾ points during this period. Spain now exhibits the third highest income quintile share ratio in the EU, with the top 20 percent of the population earning almost 7½ times as much income as the bottom 20 percent.  </P><P MCID="5">The rise in inequality and poverty rates largely reflects the impact of the crisis on the labor market. Employment fell by almost 20 percent between 2008 and mid-2013. Job losses affected disproportionally low-educated /low wage workers, youth, and immigrants, particularly working in the construction sector under temporary contracts. Moreover, unemployment spells of these groups have increased substantially, increasing the risks of social exclusion. At the same time, wage dispersion has risen, correcting in part the pre-crisis misallocation of resources to low productivity sectors and consequent wage inflation, including in the oversized construction sector, and in part reflecting the dual labor market. However, estimates suggest that the dominant effect on income inequality has been from the drop in employment (Bonhomme and Hospido, 2012; OECD, 2015).1 </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">___________ </P><P MCID="8">1 OECD (2015) In It Together.

Spain: Spillovers from Latin America </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Potential spillovers from direct financial ties could be more relevant than the trade channel. Spain’s trade exposure to Latin America is small though growing. Exports of goods and services to this region represent 1¼ percent and ½ percent of Spanish GDP, respectively (average 2013–14) suggesting limited implications from growth deceleration. The exposure through FDI channels is larger, however. Latin America accounted for over a third of the outward FDI by Spanish firms (17 percent of outward FDI flows) in 2014. As a result, Spain’s largest and publicly listed firms have a significant presence in the region, especially in Brazil and Mexico, which accounts for about one quarter of their total sales revenues. Thus, a prolonged recession and weak local currencies could harm some of these firms’ profitability and their stock market prices. Meanwhile, FDI flows from Latin America to Spain have grown rapidly in recent years, but remain low in terms of FDI stocks (less than 5 percent of total FDI).  </P><P MCID="3">Spain’s two largest and global banks maintain significant subsidiary operations in Latin America. As of March 2016, they had about one-fifth of credit exposures to Latin America resulting in total claims of Spanish banks to the region of about 12 percent of total banking sector claims—a much higher share than other advanced economies’ banking systems. In 2015, operations in Latin America accounted for 43 and 80 percent of group-wide profits (excluding centralized corporate operations) for the two Spanish global banks, respectively, contributing a higher return on assets than domestic-oriented banks. These banks operate with a subsidiary model primarily based on decentralized management and funded locally in domestic-currency. </P><P MCID="4">Spanish subsidiaries appear to be in a solid position to deal with rising credit risk, but lower profits would weaken contributions to the parents’ capital buffers. So far, the adverse macroeconomic conditions, in particular in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, and asset quality deterioration have not yet significantly marked down profitability, although NPLs typically worsen with some lag. Spanish subsidiaries should be able to manage additional losses given their relatively strong profits and provisions. Their pre-impairment net income could potentially absorb about up to twice the current NPL level, but an increase in asset impairments could have a sizeable impact on group-wide profitability. For example, a 25 percent increase in the impairment of financial assets by subsidiaries could reduce the contribution of profits to group-wide capital by about 25 percent.  </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6">0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.8051015202530354045200920102011201220132014Spain stock outward FDI (% total, LHS)Euro area stock outward FDI (% total, LHS)Spain goods exports (% GDP, RHS)Euro area goods exports (% GDP, RHS)Exposure to Latin America(Percent)Sources: DOTS, CDIS, and IMF, World Economic Outlook.</P><P MCID="7">02468101214SpainUnited KingdomUnited StatesNetherlandsFranceJapanGermanyOther euro areaItalyExposures to Latin America, March 2016(Percent of total claims; based on the ultimate risk basis)Sources: BIS, Consolidated Banking Statistics; and IMF staff calculations.</P><P MCID="8">-30-150153045607590-30-150153045607590-2024681012Problem loans net of provisions (in percent of tangible common equity)Return on average assets (in percent)Other banksSpanish subsidiariesPerformance of Major Banks in Latin America, 2015 1/Sources: SNL; and IMF staff calculations.1/ Based on a sampleof largest banks in each Latin American economy, with total assets of at least €5 billions. </P></page>

Taking Stock of the 2012 Labor Market Reforms1 </P><P MCID="1">The labor market reforms enacted in February 2012 aimed at addressing Spain’s structural problems. Spain’s labor market has historically been characterized by very high structural unemployment, employment volatility, wage rigidity, high shares of temporary employment, and low labor productivity. The 2012 reforms included measures to enhance market efficiency and reduce duality; to foster firms’ internal flexibility and avoid employment destruction; and to enhance the employability and fungibility of workers (see first chapter of Spain: Selected Issues Papers, 2015 for a detailed list of measures). </P><P MCID="2">Overall, the 2012 labor market reforms have helped improve the functioning of the Spanish labor market, but important rigidities remain. Although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of the reforms and the agreement reached by social partners in early 2012 when the recession was hitting employment hard, there is extensive evidence indicating that the reforms have supported wage moderation. Moreover, reforms and moderate wage growth have supported job creation and helped Spain regain competitiveness lost during the pre-crisis boom. The reforms have also made the labor market more resilient to shocks and promoted a moderate reduction in duality and structural unemployment. However, important structural problems remain. Unemployment is still painfully high with a high incidence of long-term unemployment. Labor market duality remains pervasive. And, although the reforms have enhanced macro-flexibility, micro-flexibility is still low.  </P><P MCID="3">The sections below summarize the main evidence so far of the impact of the reforms. </P><P MCID="4">A. Wages and Employment </P><P MCID="5">Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the labor market reforms have supported wage moderation and contributed to a pickup in job creation. Although the evidence points to increased macro-flexibility, there is no evidence of increased micro-flexibility (i.e., changes in wages still do not reflect specific business conditions of firms and sectors).    </P><P MCID="6"> Empirical analysis suggests that the reforms have contributed to significant wage moderation (Bank of Spain 2013, OECD 2014, Garcia-Perez 2016). OECD (2014) estimates a reduction in unit labor costs of 1.2–1.9 percent associated with the reforms (that is, half of the actual adjustment in the year following the reform).  </P><P MCID="7"> Analysis by IMF (2015), focusing on the variation of wages and employment across sectors during pre- and post-reform years, points to increased macro-flexibility of wages. Results show that before the reforms, wage growth accelerated in expansions, but also during downswings (though by lesser extent), slowing labor market adjustment and contributing to excessive labor shedding during recessions. Since the reform, employment contractions are no longer associated with higher wage growth. At the same time, there is no evidence that wage dynamics </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="8">1 Prepared by Sebastian Sosa. </P></page>

Finally, the study finds that wage moderation has contributed to a recovery in headline employment growth, and the reforms have made the labor market more resilient to shocks.  </P><P MCID="1"> The extent of wage moderation, however, varied significantly across level of wages and between workers who kept their jobs (stayers) and those who had to change jobs (movers). Real wages of workers in the first and second lowest deciles fell by 25 percent and 15 percent, respectively, between 2008 and mid-2013, while those of the highest deciles increased slightly (10 percent in the top decile). The movers, especially those with temporary contracts, youth, and low-skilled workers, suffered the largest losses (Conde-Ruiz and others, 2015). As a consequence of the sharp adjustment in the low end of the wage distribution, wage inequality surged significantly (see Box 2 in the 2016 IMF Staff Report). </P><P MCID="2"> Reforms have also supported hiring, in particular under permanent contracts through two channels: by increasing the probability of transition from unemployment to permanent employment and reducing the probability of dismissals for workers under temporary contracts—arguably due to the fact that firms started using the new internal flexibility provisions introduced by the reform (Garcia-Perez, 2016).2 In fact, OECD (2014) suggests that about 25,000 new permanent contracts per month can be explained by the reforms (in the first 18 months), with the impact concentrated in SMEs. De Cea and Dolado (2013) find that the output growth rate threshold necessary for net job creation declined after the reform (estimating such threshold at 0.3–1.3 percent). </P><P MCID="3"> What does the evidence show on the impact of the reforms on dismissals? OECD (2014) finds that the impact on separation rates in the first 1½ years since the reform was negligible. Meanwhile, there was evidence pointing to some negative effects of the changes introduced to the regulation on dismissals. The number of collective dismissals deemed null due to formal or administrative/procedural omissions or mistakes increased sizably, with employers being forced to re-hire dismissed workers.3 This proliferation of nullifying provisions by the courts had increased legal uncertainty (Jansen, 2015; OECD, 2014). </P><P MCID="4"> Latest estimates suggest the following quantitative impact from the increased wage moderation and firms’ internal flexibility, using two counterfactual scenarios (Doménech and others, 2016). In the absence of the wage adjustment facilitated by the reform, additional 900,000 jobs would have been lost—basically offsetting the overall net job creation observed in 2014–15. Moreover, the loss of 2 million long-term jobs and an increase of about 8 percentage points in the </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">2 However, as explained below, the overall impact on duality has been marginal in the short term. </P><P MCID="6">3 For instance, Palomo Balda (2013) shows that although litigation affected only about 5 percent of all collective dismissals between March 2012 and March 2013, in 40 percent of the cases the court ruled the collective dismissals to be null due to administrative reasons. This is the case even when in 85 percent of those cases the actual grounds for dismissal were considered to be valid. </P></page>

Duality </P><P MCID="2">The empirical evidence suggests that the labor market reforms have helped reduce duality. However, although the impact is generally statistically significant, the economic significance is still quite small. </P><P MCID="3"> Although there is some evidence suggesting that the labor market reform promoted a pickup in permanent employment, a large share of the new jobs (53 percent) relies on temporary contracts and the share of temporary jobs in overall employment has remained fairly flat since 2008 at about 25 percent—among the highest in Europe. Compared to the pre-crisis levels, the share of temporary jobs declined by around 6 percentage points, but most of the reduction was due to the large destruction of temporary jobs (mostly in the period 2008–12) rather than a substitution of temporary for permanent contracts. At the same time, the share of permanent contracts in the flow on new contracts signed each month has remained fairly stable at around 8–10 percent, with no apparent change since the reform.  </P><P MCID="4"> Results in OECD (2014) indicate that, although the reform could have contributed to some increase in new permanent jobs and increase the share of permanent employment in new hires by 3 percentage points, duality remained very high.  </P><P MCID="5"> IMF (2015) finds some evidence that the share of new hires with temporary contracts has started to decrease due to the 2012 reform. However, the reliance on temporary workers remains strong overall. </P><P MCID="6"> Garcia-Perez (2016) finds that the reform appears to have promoted the exit from unemployment into permanent employment both in absolute terms and relative to temporary employment. The results indicate that the reform has raised the transition probability from unemployment to permanent employment by about 50 percent, raising it from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent, on average, in the first 12 months of unemployment. However, since the probability of transition to temporary employment, which continues to be—by far—the most likely option (12 percent in the first year of unemployment) the overall effect on the stock of permanent employment is still marginal in the short term. The results suggest a positive but very small impact of the reform on the still high duality, to the extent that exit from unemployment to a temporary job is still five times higher than to a permanent job (12 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively).  </P><P MCID="7">C. Collective Negotiation </P><P MCID="8">Existing evidence indicates that the 2012 labor market reforms did not have a major impact on the structure of collective negotiation, with agreements still mostly negotiated at the sector-province level with few firms ‘opting-out’ from higher level agreements.  </P></page>
<page id="51" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><Artifact Attached="[/Top]" Subtype="/Header" Type="/Pagination">SPAIN </Artifact><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47 </Artifact><P MCID="0"> The evidence suggests that wage dynamics still do not adequately reflect differences in firms’ business conditions. Although there has been an increase in the number of firm-level agreements, these affect only a small number of workers mostly in large firms, and collective agreements continue to be negotiated largely at the sector-province level. Firm-level agreements remain especially unusual for SMEs, and ‘opting-out’ is the only possibility of wage adjustment for these firms, but only based on agreements with workers’ representatives, as the procedures for resolving potential conflicts associated with ‘opt-outs’ remain excessively demanding. </P><P MCID="1"> The coverage of collective negotiation has not declined as many were concerned about (see, for instance, Bentolila and Jansen, 2016). Although the number of workers affected by collective agreements has declined since the reform, the number of private sector workers has fallen even more, so that the coverage rate has actually increased moderately. </P><P MCID="2">D. Structural Unemployment </P><P MCID="3">Although there is some evidence that the labor market reforms have helped reduce the structural unemployment rate, the later remains stubbornly high, at about 16 percent.  </P><P MCID="4"> OECD (2014) finds that the reform appears to have reduced the duration of unemployment spells, which could help reduce structural unemployment. </P><P MCID="5"> IMF staff estimates indicate that between 2012 and 2015, the estimated structural unemployment declined by around 3 percentage points. However, at about 16 percent, it remains very high, reflecting both long-standing problems and the impact of the crisis. Among the long-term issues are the pervasive labor market duality and its impact on workers’ skill levels.  </P></page>

Balance Sheet Approach: How Much Has Spain Adjusted?1 </P><P MCID="1">Despite some adjustment, the Spanish economy remains vulnerable to balance sheet shocks that could be propagated through certain sectoral linkages. Potential sources of propagation are the high general government indebtedness with large exposures to the domestic financial sector and the rest of the world, lingering debt overhangs in parts of the private sector with banks, and the reliance on Euro Area monetary policy. Changes in the regional monetary policy stance, risk perception, or the occurrence of sizable shocks could put pressure on balance sheets via these sectoral linkages. </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">This note uses the balance sheet approach to assess the recent evolution of Spain’s financial vulnerabilities.2 Given that many of the remaining vulnerabilities of the Spanish economy relate to stocks rather than flows, the balance sheet assessment summarizes these exposures, their interlinkages, and which sectors have adjusted their leverage and against whom (including the role of valuation effects). The approach uses a matrix of intersectoral financial claims. For this purpose, the economy is divided into seven sectors: general government (GG), the central bank (BdE), monetary financial institutions excluding the central bank (MFI), other financial institutions (OFI), non-financial corporates (COR), households (HH), and the rest of the World (RoW). By construction, the sum of the domestic sectoral net positions equals the country’s net position vis-à-vis the rest of the world (i.e., the Net International Investment Position, NIIP).3 </P><P MCID="4">Internal and external deleveraging reflects the ongoing but yet incomplete correction of pre-crisis imbalances and the impact of the crisis. From euro adoption in 1999 to 2008, Spain experienced growing current account deficits that increased the private sector debt with the rest of the world. While households and corporates increased their indebtedness with domestic banks, these received funding from international capital markets. The gross exposure of the financial sector to the private non-financial sector peaked in 2010 at 192 percent of GDP (net exposure peaked in 2008 at 36 percent of GDP). The public sector had a very limited role in the pre-crisis deterioration of the current account deficit and worsening net international investment position with overall debt to GDP at just 51 percent of GDP in 2006. With the onset of the international financial crisis in 2008, as the non-financial private sector began its adjustment and deleveraging, the general government ran large deficits, increasing its total liabilities with </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">1 Prepared by Federico Grinberg and Phakawa Jeasakul. </P><P MCID="6">2 See also IMF “Balance Sheet Analysis in Fund Surveillance,” IMF Policy Paper, June 2015. </P><P MCID="7">3 For a balance sheet analysis of the banking sector, see Selected Issues Paper chapter II.

Even as Spain has exhibited large current account surpluses in the last three years, its position toward the rest of the world is still highly negative at 88 percent of GDP (2016:Q2). This is even slightly weaker than at end-2013, mostly due to valuation changes and the significant increase in public liabilities held by the rest of the world (17 percent) which more than offset the reduction in private sector’s net liabilities to the rest of the world (by 16 percent of GDP).  </P><P MCID="2">The public sector is now more exposed externally. Of the overall increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio of 21 percentage points since 2013, about 85 percent was absorbed by the rest of the world. The external sector has largely replaced the domestic financial system as the main investor in newly issued government securities, but banks’ exposure to the Spanish sovereign remains large (see below).  </P><P MCID="3">Non-financial sector borrowing from domestic banks has fallen from its peak in 2009. Credit growth to the non-financial private sector has remained negative owing to the weak demand for new loans. While the demand for new loans has picked up in line with the economic recovery, amortization has continued to outpace new bank lending. Depressed consumption and investment levels, on the back of high unemployment, weak disposable incomes, low house prices, and the need for corporates and households to strengthen their financial positions are the main reasons behind the weak demand for new credit. </P><P MCID="4">Banks’ exposure to households remains to be a vulnerability. Household debt (both relative to GDP and disposable income) has been brought to a level that is comparable to other major EU countries. However, household indebtedness in EU countries has been on the rise and is generally considered to be a vulnerability. At the same time, the financial wealth of Spanish households is far below that of EU peers and housing wealth well below pre-crisis levels, even though it is high in international comparison.  </P><P MCID="5">The domestic banking system has reduced its sovereign exposure facilitated by the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP). Since 2015, the ECB’s QE has purchased important amounts of government-issued securities. These operations are largely carried out by domestic central banks and kept on their balance sheets,4 while increasing their liabilities against the ECB (i.e., the rest of the </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">4 Nine percent is done directly by the ECB and kept in its balance sheet.  </P><P MCID="7">-100-80-60-40-20020-100-80-60-40-200202001Q12001Q42002Q32003Q22004Q12004Q42005Q32006Q32007Q22008Q12008Q42009Q32010Q22011Q12011Q42012Q32013Q22014Q12014Q42015Q32016Q2RoWBdEOther financial institutionsMonetary financial institutions (excl.

Banks receive liquidity in exchange for reducing their exposure to the general government. While in principle this liquidity could have any use, in the context of non-financial domestic private sector deleveraging, Spanish banks have used it to reduce their liabilities with the rest of the world. As a result, banks have reduced their balance sheets by selling assets (government securities) and paying back their liabilities (with the Eurosystem). In the BdE’s balance sheet, which is the mirror image to that of banks in these transactions, assets (government debt) and liabilities increased (which is reflected in an increase in Target2 balances).  </P><P MCID="1">Spanish banks still hold a large proportion of sovereign debt compared to peers. Even after having stabilized their exposure to government debt, domestic banks are still highly exposed to sovereign risk. The fact that this exposure is mainly domestic is a source of vulnerabilities. </P><P MCID="2">Valuation changes, resulting from renewed confidence and monetary policy, contributed significantly to balance sheet changes.5 Between 2013:Q1 and 2016:Q2 the rest of the world received positive valuation gains equivalent to about 11 percent of GDP as Spanish-issued assets regained value.6 Household deleveraging is also linked in large parts to positive valuation changes, accounting for about 10 percent of GDP, slightly less than half of their total net asset increase. On the other hand, net debtor sectors, such as the general government and monetary financial institutions (including BdE), experienced an increase in the value of their liabilities. This resulted in sizable negative valuation effects equivalent to about 9 percent of GDP for the general government and monetary financial institutions, respectively. The valuation loss for non-financial corporates was about 2 percent of GDP.   </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="3">5 Valuation changes are computed as the difference between the change in the stock and the cumulative net sectoral transaction flows. </P><P MCID="4">6 The counterpart of this is the reduction in Spain’s liabilities yields and spreads compression (see SIP chapter II).  </P><P MCID="5">-30-20-100102030-30-20-100102030MFI and BdEOFIGGCORHHRoWChange in net positionValuation changesChange in Net Position: 2013Q1-2016Q2(Percent of GDP)Sources: Haver Analytics, and IMF staff calculations. </P><P MCID="6">0501001502002503003500501001502002503003502015Q12015Q22015Q32015Q42016Q12016Q22016Q3Holdings under PSPPTarget2 balanceTarget2 and Quantitative Easing(Billions)Source: Haver Analytics.</P><P MCID="7">03691215180369121518LUXDEUFINSWEDNKIRLNLDFRAAUTBELEAPRTESPITAClaims on other government in the euro area 1/Claims on own governmentClaims on Government, June 2016(Percent of total assets of depository institutions)Source: IMF International Financial Statistics.</P></page>

Debt Sustainability Analysis </P><P MCID="1">Public debt sustainability risks remain sizeable, despite the reduction of the headline fiscal deficit over the last six years. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to decline slowly over the medium term from the peak of 100.4 percent of GDP in 2014, on the back of a slightly favorable growth-interest rate differential. However, at 95.6 percent of GDP in 2021, debt would remain at risky levels. A negative growth shock and the realization of contingent liabilities represent the largest risks to public debt sustainability. Returning to a gradual but steady and credible fiscal consolidation remains a priority. An annual structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP over the medium term would put debt firmly on a downward path, bringing it around 91.6 percent of GDP by 2021—4 percentage points lower than under the baseline. Gross financing needs have declined below the 20 percent of GDP early warning benchmark and are projected to continue to fall gradually over the medium term. However, at 16½ percent of GDP in 2021 they would remain among the highest in the euro area. </P><P MCID="2">A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis </P><P MCID="3">Background </P><P MCID="4">Definitions and coverage. Public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt in the hands of the General Government. The General Government includes the Central Government, Regional Governments, Local Governments, and Social Security Funds. It includes only those public enterprises that are defined as part of General Government under European System of Accounts. EDP debt is a subset of General Government consolidated debt (i.e., it does not include trade credits and other accounts payable) and the stocks are recorded at their nominal value. </P><P MCID="5">Developments. The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 35.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 99.8 percent in 2015, driven by large fiscal deficits (of about 7¾ percent of GDP on average during 2008–15), and a largely unfavorable growth interest rate differential (which contributed by an annual average of about 2½ percent of GDP). The support to the banking sector added about 4½ percent of GDP to the public debt stock. </P><P MCID="6">Gross financing needs have declined below 20 percent of GDP after peaking at 22 percent in 2012, on the back of an ongoing maturity extension and nominal deficit reduction. The ECB’s quantitative easing has helped bringing sovereign bond yields down. The 10-year bond yield has declined from about 6¾ percent in mid-2012 to about 1.5 percent in November 2016. The effective interest rate on outstanding debt has also declined, and interest payments are expected to fall below 3 percent of GDP in 2016. </P><P MCID="7">Other factors. The amortization profile of public debt is tilted towards the long term (82 percent of total debt, on a residual maturity basis). The marginal life at issuance has increased steadily since 2012, from 5 years to over 9 years in 2015, with the average life of outstanding debt increasing from 6.2 to 6.6 years over the same period. Holdings of public debt are relatively well diversified. The </P></page>

The Eurosystem’s purchases under the public sector purchases programme (PSPP) amounted to about EUR61 billion in 2015 (28 percent of the gross financing needs). The share of public debt held by residents declined by 10 percentage points since 2012 to 57½ by end-2015, but remains significantly above the 2007 level (50 percent). The stock of financial assets has been increasing gradually since 2012, amounting to about 35 percent of GDP in 2015. This constitutes a risk mitigating factor, with net public debt levels amounting to 80 percent of GDP.  </P><P MCID="1">Baseline </P><P MCID="2">Public debt is projected to remain at 99.2 percent of GDP in 2017, before declining slowly to 95.6 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs are expected to remain below 20 percent, gradually declining over the projection period. However, at 16½ percent of GDP in 2021, they would remain relatively high compared to other euro area countries. </P><P MCID="3">Assumptions. The baseline scenario is based on the medium-term projections (Table 1). In particular, (i) growth is projected to remain at 3.2 percent in 2016 and moderate to 2.3 percent in 2017, as the effect of tailwinds dissipates; (ii) over the medium term, growth is set to converge toward its potential rate of around 1½ percent; (iii) a structural adjustment of around ½ percent of GDP in 2017, followed by a broadly neutral fiscal stance over the medium term in structural primary terms; (iv) inflation (based on the GDP deflator) is projected to increase gradually from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 1½ percent in 2021; and (v) long-term sovereign spreads are assumed to increase slowly from 1.2 percent in 2015 to 1.5 percent in the medium term, with 10-year bond yields increasing moderately over the medium term in line with a gradual normalization of monetary policy. </P><P MCID="4">Stress tests </P><P MCID="5">Public debt levels would either remain broadly flat or increase under a number of standard shock scenarios. Debt dynamics would worsen significantly in the event of a materialization of contingent liabilities and in case the economy is hit by a combination of negative shocks to GDP growth and the primary balance, with the stock of public debt peaking in 2018 at around 116½ percent of GDP and 111 percent of GDP respectively.  </P><P MCID="6">Growth shock. In this scenario, real GDP growth rates are assumed to be lower than in the baseline by one (10-year historical) standard deviation for two consecutive years, in 2017–18. This would imply real GDP would decline on average by 0.5 percent per year, compared to annual average growth of 2.2 percent under the baseline. Under this recession scenario, inflation would be lower and the primary balance weaker (by about 2 percent of GDP per year, on average). In this context, the debt-to-GDP ratio would raise substantially, reaching 109.8 percent of GDP in 2018 before declining slowly to 106.6 percent in 2021 (11 percentage points higher than the baseline). Meanwhile, gross financing needs would increase above the 20 percent benchmark level reaching 22.1 percent in 2018, due to the larger fiscal deficit. </P></page>

This scenario assumes a relaxation of fiscal policy in 2017–18, with a cumulative deterioration of the primary balance of 4½ percent of GDP (that is, assuming a shock equal to ½ the 10-year historical standard deviation of the primary balance-to-GDP ratio). Under this scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to increase, peaking at 103.3 percent of GDP in 2018 and then declining gradually to 100.3 percent in 2021, 4.7 percentage points higher than in the baseline. The larger primary deficits would also imply more sizable gross financing requirements than in the baseline, and would peak at 20.9 percent of GDP in 2018. </P><P MCID="1">Interest rate shock. Over the five year forecast horizon, the debt dynamics could withstand relatively well a nominal interest rate shock of about 240 basis points during 2017–21, given the relatively long debt maturity and the high share of debt at fixed interest rates. Under such a scenario, the effective interest rate would increase to 3.7 percent by 2021 compared to 2.7 percent in the baseline. The debt-to-GDP ratio would remain broadly stable, amounting to 98.3 percent in 2021. However, a sizeable and sustained increase in interest rates would reduce the (already limited) fiscal space.  </P><P MCID="2">Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would be particularly adverse for public debt dynamics, mostly due to the impact of lower growth and higher primary deficits. In this scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 111.1 percent in 2018, remaining at this high level through 2021 (almost 15 percentage points higher than under the baseline). Gross financing needs would also be significantly higher, peaking at over 22.9 percent of GDP in 2018.  </P><P MCID="3">Contingent liability shock. Large, negative unexpected events could put debt sustainability at risk. A negative financial sector shock scenario, assuming a one-time increase in non-interest public expenditures (in 2017) equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets, combined with lower growth and lower inflation in 2017–18 (i.e., growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation) would be particularly adverse for public debt dynamics. The materialization of such contingency liabilities would raise the primary deficit to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2017, bringing gross financing needs to 28.7 percent of GDP (about 9 percentage points above standard early warning benchmark levels). Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to increase, peaking at 116.5 percent in 2018, then slowly declining to about 113.5 percent in 2021 (17.9 percentage points higher than the baseline). </P><P MCID="4">Heat Map </P><P MCID="5">Risks associated with public debt remain high as the benchmark level (85 percent of GDP) is breached under the baseline scenario as well as in each of the shock scenarios. Gross financing needs would remain below 20 percent of GDP under the baseline, but would surpass that benchmark level in the case of output and primary balance shocks and the materialization of contingent liabilities. Regarding the debt profile, risks stem from the high level of external financing needs and—to a lesser extent—from the share of public debt held by non-residents. </P></page>

External Debt Sustainability Analysis1 </P><P MCID="1">While external debt is set to continue its gradual decline over the medium term, it will take time to reach levels that significantly lower the vulnerability to external shocks. The currently low cost of debt, favorable maturity structure, export and bank exposure diversification, and competiveness gains since the crisis are mitigating factors. </P><P MCID="2">Methodology. The external DSA provides a framework to examine a country’s external sustainability that complements the External Sector Report (Appendix 2). The external DSA estimates the external debt path under a number of alternative scenarios. While the assumptions are relatively mechanistic and the estimates do not employ full-fledged alternative macroeconomic scenarios, they can nevertheless provide useful insights on the potential impact of a range of shocks.  </P><P MCID="3">Baseline. As for the public DSA, the baseline scenario is based on the medium-term projections (Table 1). In particular, it assumes a moderation of the Spanish real GDP growth recovery over the medium term to its estimated potential growth rate of about 1½ percent of GDP. The trade balance and current account are forecast to remain in surplus, somewhat above the 2015 levels. Driven by continued strong export growth due to regained competitiveness, the external debt-to-export ratio is projected to sharply decline (by over 132 percentage points) during 2016–21. After falling to 168 percent of GDP by end-2015, external debt and is projected to decline to 142 percent of GDP by 2021. At the same time, gross external financing needs will continue to decline in the projection period but remain a vulnerability given their high level with around 61 percent of GDP by 2021.  </P><P MCID="4">Stress scenarios. The DSA scenarios suggest that Spain’s external debt will remain high but continue to gradually decline over the medium term unless key macroeconomic variables return to levels of the crisis episode. Overall, the external debt level remains a vulnerability given the sizable external and domestic risks surrounding the Spanish economic recovery. </P><P MCID="5">Historical shock scenario. The external debt path would fail to stabilize in a scenario based on historical data properties. Assuming real GDP growth path of only 0.4 percent over the next five years combined with a 1.2 percentage point higher nominal interest rate, would raise external debt by more than 30 percent of GDP by 2021. Under such a shock the external debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 202 percent of GDP.  </P><P MCID="6">Interest rate shock.: In the case of a rather benign interest rate shock (an increase from 1.9 percent in the baseline to 2.7 percent), external debt would rise only slightly (3 percentage points by 2021). </P><P MCID="7">Real depreciation shock. A 30 percent real depreciation shock would have a similar impact as the interest rate shock. In the external DSA, the mechanic transmission channel is via valuation effects, </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="8">1 Historical data revisions by the authorities explain the increase in external debt from 160.1 percent of GDP in 2014 (as reported in the 2015 Staff Report) to the currently reported value of 168.5 percent of GDP for the same year. This one-off also affects the level of the projected external debt path. </P></page>

Assuming that real GDP growth averages 0.6 percent, compared with 2 percent in the baseline, external debt would be around 11 percent of GDP higher in 2021 (153 percent of GDP).  </P><P MCID="2">Combined shock. A similar elevated external debt path is obtained in the combined shock scenario, which assumes one quarter standard deviation shocks to the real interest rate, real GDP growth rate, and the current account balance. As a result, the external debt-to-GDP would be 12 percent higher in 2021 at 154 percent of GDP. </P><P MCID="3">An Extended External DSA </P><P MCID="4">Methodology. Using estimated equations for export and import demand (see second chapter of Selected Issues paper), the extended DSA incorporates some reduced form responses of the components of the trade balance to specific shocks. While this is still not a full-fledged general equilibrium exercise, it complements the standard external DSA presented above.2  </P><P MCID="5">Real appreciation shock. A 30 percent nominal appreciation of the Euro against the USD bilateral exchange would appreciate the real effective exchange rate by about 8 percent, slowing down export growth and thus reducing the trade balance to about 1/2 percent of GDP in the medium term. This alone would result in an external debt of 6 percent by 2021. However, the revaluation effect partially offsets this increase, with a resulting debt-to-GDP ratio of 149 percent by 2021.3  </P><P MCID="6">Oil price shock. A permanent reversion of the oil price to its 2001–15 average (US$ 66 per barrel) by 2017 would reduce the trade balance to 1.4 percent of GDP in the medium term, and external debt would increase by 10 percentage points by 2021 relative to the baseline.  </P><P MCID="7">Global demand slow down shock. Assuming sustained weak global demand, in particular that Spain’s trading partners’ import demand grows permanently by 1 percentage point less every year, would lower’s Spain’s export growth. As a result, the medium-term trade balance would fall to 1.3 percent of GDP and external debt would increase by 10 percentage points relative to the baseline. </P><P MCID="8">Combined shock. A scenario that combines the EUR/USD appreciation, the oil price increase, and the external demand deceleration would imply an external debt of 157 percent of GDP in 2021, compared to the 142 percent of GDP in the baseline.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="9">2 See second chapter of Selected Issues paper for more details.  </P><P MCID="10">3 As in all other shocks, this partial equilibrium analysis ignores the effect on GDP growth that the shock may have. </P></page>

The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">1.CPI inflation accelerated in December, and real GDP growth in 2016 may have beenslightly higher than projected. The marked rise in inflation in December to 1.6 percent (year-over-year), from 0.7 percent in November, reflects mostly higher energy prices. Core inflation edged up to 1.0 percent in December, 0.2 percentage points higher than in November. As a result, the average inflation outturn for 2016 was slightly higher    (-0.2 percent) than previously estimated. Base effects, along with possible further oil price rises, create upside risks to the 2017 inflation projection. High frequency indicators for December, including a stronger manufacturing PMI and continued solid employment growth, also point to sustained strong economic activity that could have put 2016 annual real GDP growth slightly beyond the estimated 3.2 percent.  </P><P MCID="12">2.The government is launching several policy initiatives. Following the EuropeanCourt of Justice ruling that nullified abusive variable-interest mortgage contracts with floor clauses, the government has issued a decree to establish a mediation mechanism that would facilitate the settlement between banks and borrowers, reducing the burden of the court system that needs to rule whether individual mortgage contracts are abusive. The government has also announced its intention to task the fiscal council (AIReF) with conducting an expenditure review. Moreover, the central government and most regional governments agreed to seek reforms for the regional financing system, with an expert commission to be formed in one month. </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14"></P></page>
<page id="80" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><P MCID="0"></P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Statement by Mr. Jorge Dajani, Alternate Executive Director for Spain, Ms. Sanchez Rodriguez and Mr. Lopez, Advisors to the Executive Director  January 27, 2017 </P><P MCID="3"></P><P MCID="4"></P><P MCID="5">We thank Ms. Schaechter and her team for the candid dialogue held during the mission, for the congruence of views and for their hard work on the staff report, including the four selected issues papers. We agree with their assessment that bold structural reforms have laid the ground for Spain’s current recovery, and that it is essential to preserve them and continue to make further progress. We also agree with the many constructive and useful economic policy recommendations, which are broadly in line with the authorities’ goals.  </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7">Moreover, we are pleased that the staff report recognizes that “the priorities of the new government are preserving earlier reform achievements and meeting short-term fiscal commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.” Although under a minority government, there is broad political consensus about several policy priorities and reforms that can support growth in the immediate future and more importantly, raise Spain’s growth potential to higher levels.  </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9">Economic performance </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">Throughout 2016 Spain continued the expansionary trend that started three years ago, outperforming the Eurozone and the world’s largest economies. Real GDP growth will be at least 3.2 percent in 2016, and by mid-2017 the economy should have recovered pre-crisis income levels. We agree with staff that growth forecasts for the subsequent years will remain over 2 percent despite some deceleration coming from milder tailwinds. The staff report correctly highlights that Spain has managed to achieve this “impressive recovery” thanks to sound economic policies and structural reforms which have contributed to raise short-term growth, growth potential and confidence. This economic turnaround has also allowed the ongoing correction of Spain’s main external and internal imbalances under a more sustainable growth model. </P><P MCID="12"></P><P MCID="13">Labor market </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15">The 2012 labor market reform is a case in point. It improved labor dynamics, allowing for wage moderation and eventually lowered the GDP growth threshold for net employment creation from 2 percent to around 0.7 percent. In the last two years, more than 1 million net jobs have been created. Spain is currently creating around 500,000 net jobs per year on average, with employment growing at rates over 3 percent year-on-year since 2015. This recovery has driven down the unemployment rate by 8 p.p. from its peak, with youth and long-term unemployment </P></page>

Moreover, as staff rightly acknowledges, job creation has helped to reduce inequality in Spain since 2014.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Measures to reduce duality and to make permanent contracts more attractive are paying off, as almost half of total job creation among wage-earners is already permanent. The prospects for the long-term unemployed keep improving, with flows out of unemployment gradually strengthening for this group.  </P><P MCID="3">We also agree with staff’s assessment that there is no room for complacency: job creation remains the key challenge for the Spanish economy. Staff correctly points out that it is essential to safeguard the reforms, and that there is scope to continue improving the functioning of the labor market, especially in the field of active labor market policies.  </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">External sector  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Spain is expected to record in 2016 a current account surplus for the fourth year in a row; never before in recent history had Spain experienced subsequent external surpluses, especially relevant in the context of high economic growth. The IMF expects a surplus of 2 percent in 2016, highlighting that “sustained and healthy export growth reflects regained competitiveness arising from price and wage moderation and larger firm’s internationalization efforts.” Net exports are currently contributing to economic growth, and the share of exports to GDP is almost ten percentage points higher than before the crisis. In fact, Spain has shifted from being a net borrower to a net lender, and will record in 2016 its fifth consecutive year with lending capacity to the rest of the world.  </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">This accumulation of external surpluses is finally being reflected in the reduction of the negative NIIP despite adverse valuation effects. As these effects subside, and given that current account surpluses are expected to continue, the NIIP is set to improve further. Although we agree with staff’s views that this external vulnerability needs to be further addressed, a number of mitigating factors should be taken into account: the NIIP has a large debt related FDI component (20 percent of GDP), and significant large gross equity liabilities (60 percent of GDP); debt is mainly denominated in domestic currency and its maturity is predominantly long term; as for assets, they are diversified. Both staff and the authorities expect the NIIP to continue improving in the coming years. </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">Financial sector  </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">The authorities agree with staff’s assessment on the financial sector: the banking system has gained further strength due to better asset quality, stronger capital and funding positions and reduced debt overhangs. The system is closer to putting most of the crisis legacies behind it and NPLs, which show a downward trend, are well provisioned. Furthermore, the dynamics of bank credit are supportive of private sector deleveraging, while facilitating new credit flows. Challenges ahead include the low profitability environment and new regulatory initiatives, </P></page>

The authorities look forward to the upcoming 2017 FSAP, which will be concluded by next September. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Private sector deleveraging </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">The deleveraging process of the private sector has been particularly intensive; non-consolidated private sector debt has fallen by 50 percentage points since 2010, almost converging with the euro area average in the third quarter of 2016. Corporate indebtedness has fallen below the euro area average and household debt has decreased by almost 20 p.p., standing slightly above the euro area level. More importantly, this deleveraging process has been compatible with new loans to SMEs and households. As the IMF correctly states, “the stronger banking system has been broadly supportive of the economic recovery, with financial conditions having eased further.”  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Fiscal policy </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Fiscal consolidation has played an important role in restoring confidence. Over the last years Spain has delivered one of the largest fiscal adjustments in the Eurozone, against the backdrop of a severe recession. According to IMF projections, public deficit will stand at 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016 and 3.2 percent in 2017, broadly in line with the authorities’ views. With the support of other political parties, the government has approved fiscal measures amounting to more than €7 billion for 2017, including, among others, increases in the CIT tax base, increases in excise taxes and improvements in tax collection. The European Commission estimates that these measures will yield an adjusted fiscal structural effort of 0.7 percent of GDP, thus continuing with the consolidation process initiated a few years ago. With all these measures, included in the updated Draft Budgetary Plan of Spain, the European Commission considers that Spain is broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. The negotiation of a new budget for 2017 is now under way, and the government is committed to deliver the fiscal targets for 2017. Unlike the IMF, we do not foresee any need to raise VAT in the future, as the implementation of the spending rule should be sufficient to bring down the deficit to equilibrium in structural terms going forward.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The public debt to GDP ratio peaked in 2014 and both the IMF and the authorities expect it to come down to around 99 percent of GDP in 2017 and decline further in the coming years. The debt reduction strategy is based on an adequate fiscal consolidation path and the government’s full commitment to comply with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">Productivity </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">We concur with staff on the need to raise productivity, particularly for SMEs, through structural reforms. The authorities are committed to guaranteeing continuous implementation of the Market Unity Law, curbing red tape and market fragmentation, improving SMEs’ </P></page>

Similarly, there is consensus on the need to support SME growth, which should help to foster R&amp;D investment and the export capacity of companies. The authorities are very appreciative of the analytical work made by staff regarding competitiveness, productivity and the impact on growth of structural reforms, which is estimated to be 2.5 p.p. in the next five years. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Economic policy and priorities </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Going forward, the strong recovery of the Spanish economy does not imply that risks or challenges have disappeared. In fact, as the staff report points out, external risks have not abated and there are stock imbalances, such as high unemployment and high public debt, which take time to be fully addressed and therefore deserve full attention by the authorities. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">On this issue, we understand staff’s concerns that political fragmentation could pose challenges to rekindling momentum for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation. However, the significant number of reforms and measures announced by the new Government and the main political partners since last December point to a reformist agenda. Some of these measures have not been included in the staff report due to the cut-off date, and they are relevant in structural terms. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Aside from the fiscal measures already mentioned, the recent Draft Budgetary Plan includes plans to mandate the independent fiscal authority to conduct a thorough expenditure review at all levels of the administration. An expert committee on pension reform will be set up and Parliament will debate its main findings in the coming months. Similarly, a high level working group on regional financing will be established with a view to a new regional financial framework within one year. In the financial sector, a Royal Decree Law has been recently adopted by the Council of Ministers establishing a new out-of-court procedure to facilitate a smooth resolution of claims related with non-transparent floor clauses. Moreover, the Government has announced reforms to the current Law on Mortgages which will improve consumer protection. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">After months of political uncertainty, a new government is finally in place. The impressive achievements of the Spanish economy in the last few years, as highlighted by the staff report, are the result of an ambitious structural reform program coupled with fiscal consolidation, which have allowed the economy to reap the full benefits of tailwinds, regaining the competitiveness lost, largely correcting its macroeconomic imbalances and fostering confidence in the future. </P></page>
