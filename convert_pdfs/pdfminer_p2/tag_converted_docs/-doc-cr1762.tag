Real GDP grew by 7.4 percent in the first half 2016/17, rebounding from recession in 2015/16. However, growth in the non-oil sector averaged 0.9 percent, despite the pick-up registered in the second quarter, reflecting continued difficulties in access to finance and domestic financial sector and structural weaknesses. Inflation declined to single digits and has hovered in the 9.5 percent range, year-on-year, since mid-2016. The foreign exchange market stabilized although it experienced some volatility towards end-2016 before recovering in January 2017. The spread between the official and the market rate has narrowed to about 15 percent. </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15">Growth is projected to stabilize at 4.5 percent over the medium-term as the recovery broadens. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent in 2016/17 and to ease to 3.3 percent in 2017/18 as oil production remains at the OPEC target. Thereafter, higher FDI and a gradual improvement in domestic financial conditions drive investment and stronger non-oil sector growth. The current account is forecast to remain in surplus as higher exports offset the pick-up in imports related to investment. Inflation is expected to temporarily rise to 11.9 percent (year-on-year) by end-2017/18 reflecting recent liquidity growth and pass-through from exchange rate depreciation, but to return to single digits on the back of prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The pace of job creation lags that needed to absorb the large number of new entrants to the labor market and unemployment remains high. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination"></Artifact><P MCID="16">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Given the renewed uncertainty, Directors emphasized the importance of maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and building buffers, strengthening the financial sector, and advancing reforms to lessen Iran’s reliance on oil and develop the private sector. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment in this regard and the thrust of their reform plans. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">Directors saw an urgent need for financial sector reforms to sustain financial stability and finance growth. They recommended enhanced supervision of distressed banks and an asset quality review to identify viable banks that warrant recapitalization and nonviable banks to be resolved. They encouraged the authorities to support recapitalization of public banks with measures that improve their commercial viability and wind down directed credit schemes. They looked forward to the approval of the new banking bill that would give the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) the supervisory powers to implement reforms. Directors also encouraged quick passage of the central bank bill to modernize the monetary policy framework and provide greater operational independence to the CBI to pursue low and stable inflation.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Directors urged the authorities to implement a medium-term fiscal framework to underpin their commitment to prudent fiscal policy and ensure gradual fiscal adjustment while funding financial sector reform costs. Higher revenue collections, further fuel price adjustment, and better targeting of cash transfers would create space to support growth and equity through higher public investment and cash transfers to the poor. Directors encouraged the authorities to explore the scope to use oil revenues to fund bank recapitalization, and noted the importance of replenishing the Oil Stabilization Fund to provide the budget a buffer.  </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">Directors welcomed recent steps to strengthen the AML/CFT framework, the introduction of IFRS reporting in banks, and the audit and securitization of government arrears, which will help unlock corporates’ and banks’ balance sheets and facilitate greater investment. They urged the authorities to fully implement the FATF action plan, further enhance the AML/CFT framework, and improve the transparency of corporate ownership to facilitate re-integration into the global financial system and restore correspondent banking relationships. They noted that reducing the role of the state and improving the business climate would foster foreign investment and aid job creation. Labor market reforms, including specific measures to facilitate youth and female employment, would ensure that more people have opportunities to work and make growth more inclusive.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="10">2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

The lifting of nuclear sanctions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has spurred growth, but banking system weaknesses, structural bottlenecks, and hesitation by foreign banks to re-establish financial links have held back expansion of non-oil activity.  </P><P MCID="4">Outlook and risks. Iran could grow by about 4½ percent over the medium-term with the implementation of reforms. Risks are to the downside, however, reflecting renewed external uncertainty and a demanding reform agenda that requires broad political support. </P><P MCID="5">Policy discussions focused on the sequencing and implementation of the authorities’ reform plan, and equipping the policy framework to support stability and address shocks:  </P><P MCID="6">Comprehensive banking sector reform is urgently needed. Banks should be restructured and recapitalized to safeguard financial stability, reduce high lending rates, and support growth. This would reduce banks’ reliance on Central Bank funding and bolster capital levels.  </P><P MCID="7">Reforms to the monetary policy framework would anchor low and stable inflation. The central bank requires operational independence and instruments to safeguard low inflation and pave the way for exchange rate unification. </P><P MCID="8">Fiscal policy needs to create space for reform costs and pro-growth spending. Public debt will rise as the government clears its liabilities and recapitalizes banks. A medium-term fiscal framework that targets a gradual reduction in the non-oil deficit and expansion in tax revenue would accommodate higher spending, support growth, and safeguard inflation and fiscal sustainability. </P><P MCID="9">Structural reforms that facilitate foreign investment would ease domestic financing constraints while labor market reforms would foster job creation for all.  </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">February 9, 2017 </P></page>

Higher oil production and exports, following the removal of nuclear sanctions in January 2016, is supporting a strong rebound in growth. The prudent monetary and fiscal policies implemented in recent years paved the way for inflation to fall to single digits and stabilized the foreign exchange market. Progress was made in addressing Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) deficiencies, including passage of a CFT law. Foreign investors are planning sizeable investments in the hydrocarbon and manufacturing sectors. </P><P MCID="3">2.      Still Iran faces considerable challenges in realizing its full potential. The fall in oil prices since their 2014 peak further reduced fiscal space and buffers already eroded under sanctions. Limited access to correspondent banking relations (CBR) has constrained trade, investment inflows and access to international reserves (Box 1). More recently, renewed uncertainty regarding sanctions is dampening sentiment. Domestically, the banking system is fragile and unable to support the recovery. Unemployment remains high and private sector job creation is slow. With per capita incomes unchanged from a decade ago and poverty on the rise, pressure to realize rapid gains is high. Presidential elections are scheduled for May 2017. </P><P MCID="4">3.      The authorities are putting in place the elements of an ambitious reform plan to address these challenges, consistent with past IMF advice. They remain committed to prudent monetary and fiscal policies to underpin hard won economic stability. Under their Financial Sector Reform Plan, draft Central Bank and Banking bills aim to modernize the monetary policy framework and strengthen supervisory powers. The government has begun to clear its payment arrears, provided seed funds to recapitalize some banks, and plans to expand tax collections. The Sixth National Development Plan (NDP) aims to develop the private sector and reduce oil dependency. The challenge will be to prioritize and coordinate these complex reforms to definitively address structural weaknesses, sustain economic and financial stability, and secure higher, more inclusive growth. </P><P MCID="5">Box 1. Impediments to Correspondent Banking with Iran  </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7">Despite the lifting of nuclear sanctions by the JCPOA—a multilateral agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1 which was ratified by the UN—on January 16, 2016, non-U.S. global banks are reluctant to re-engage Iranian banks because of remaining sanctions as well as AML/CFT concerns, including opacity of ownership of legal entities, and health of local banks.  </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9">Sanctions relief so far … </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">The JCPOA resulted in important relief. The oil embargo was lifted. E.U. and other countries’ sanctions that targeted Iran’s nuclear program ended. SWIFT reconnected Iranian banks to its payments system. Iranian banks have entered into CBRs with small and medium non-U.S. banks (around 238, but half 2006 levels) reducing financial transaction costs and improving the ease of cross-border trade. Access to foreign exchange reserves improved with some US$30 billion in blocked or frozen assets and oil receipts released. </P><P MCID="12"></P><P MCID="13">But other sanctions remain in place...</P><P MCID="14">. </P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16">U.S. primary sanctions remain in place and apply to U.S. financial institutions and companies, including non-U.S. branches (but not subsidiaries). U.S. dollar clearing restrictions have not been lifted and pose a significant challenge for larger non-U.S. global banks to re-establish CBRs. This in turn restricts access to corporate trade finance and limits access to reserves, foreign assets, and export earnings particularly from dollar-dominated oil sales. On December 15, 2016, the Iran Sanctions (10 years) extension Act became law. Other non-nuclear sanctions, including SDN list restrictions, which were broadened to cover new individuals and companies in February 2017, remain in place (see SIP, Chapter 1).   </P><P MCID="17"></P><P MCID="18"></P></page>

Inflation declined to low and single digits (Figure 2). Inflation fell to a multi-year low of 6.8 percent y/y in June 2016, down from a peak of 45 percent in June 2013 reflecting favorable food prices and prudent policies. Inflation has since hovered in the 9½ percent range on higher world food prices and faster liquidity growth. M2 had risen by 28.3 percent y/y by end-December 2016 driven by CBI support to banks and the government drawing on its revolving facility.  </P><P MCID="1">6.      Iran’s external position strengthened (Tables 3–4, Figure 3). The current account surplus reached a recent low of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015/16 owing to low oil prices and curtailment of oil exports by sanctions. With the lifting of sanctions, higher oil exports and more favorable oil prices, the current account surplus is expected to rise to 6 percent of GDP in 2016/17. Renewed foreign investor inflows in the hydrocarbon, automobile and telecom industries are boosting FDI. The authorities are improving trade opportunities, by clearing arrears to export credit guarantee agencies and negotiating trade agreements with regional partners. </P><P MCID="2">7.      The foreign exchange market experienced some volatility towards end-2016. Through October 2016, the official exchange rate had depreciated by about 7 percent y/y from end-2015, whereas the market rate remained broadly steady. Over the remainder of 2016, the market rate depreciated sharply reflecting seasonal factors and the rise in sanctions-related uncertainty. It then recovered in January 2017 and the spread between the official and the market rate narrowed to 15 percent. Preparations for exchange rate unification have continued. Over half of all import categories have been shifted to the bureau market. Banks have been permitted to use non-oil export proceeds to fund imports to aid the re-creation of an interbank FX market.  </P><P MCID="3">8.      Monetary and fiscal policy have strived to support the recovery (Tables 5–11). Interest rate caps on one-year deposits were cut from 18 to 15 percent, and lending rates from 20 to 18 percent. Banks were instructed to allocate at least 10 percent of their loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing. Statutory reserves requirements were selectively reduced from 13 to 10 percent based on banks’ asset quality and risk management. However, in the face of high nonperforming loans (NPLs), real interest rates remain high. The non-oil fiscal deficit of the central (general) government increased from 8.2 (11) percent of non-oil GDP in 2014/15 to 9.0 (11.5) percent in 2015/16 and is projected to rise to 10.6 (13.4) percent in 2016/17 as improved tax collections prove insufficient to fully offset higher current spending and transfers to the Targeted Subsidy Organization (TSO).1 The overall central (general) government fiscal deficit is estimated to increase from 1.8 (2.9) percent of GDP in 2015/16 to 3.1 (3.2) percent of GDP by end-2016/17. However, the 2017/18 central government budget submitted to parliament targets a zero balance due to higher oil receipts. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="4">1 The TSO administers revenues from domestic fuel sales to finance universal cash transfers.  </P></page>

The financial sector remains weak. NPLs are high (about 12 percent), but would be significantly higher were it not for recent regulations permitting the rollover of overdue loans into new loans contingent on a partial repayment. The implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in banks in 2016 shows that the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the banking system has declined from 8.4 percent in March 2012 to 5.8 percent in March 2015. It also revealed substantial capital needs in state-owned banks (16 percent of total assets) where the average CAR is negative. Profitability remains constrained by the high cost of funds—some banks are competing aggressively for deposits by offering rates above the mandated caps and the interbank market rate remains at around 19 percent—and the lending rate cap. </P><P MCID="1">10.      The authorities are starting to address financial system weakness. Most notably, the CBI has restructured and brought most UFIs under its supervision, addressing an important source of </P><P MCID="2">financial instability. The CBI has requested banks to retain profits and raise capital. The proposed Banking Bill enhances the supervisory tool-kit by providing for consolidated supervision and an array of corrective measures. The government also started issuing market bonds to secure its payment arrears to banks, and approved the use of part of the CBI’s foreign exchange revaluation gains to help settle banks’ debt vis-à-vis the CBI.  </P><P MCID="3">B.   Outlook and Risks </P><P MCID="4">11.      Growth is projected to stabilize at 4½ percent over the medium-term as the recovery broadens. Real GDP growth is projected to reach 6.6 percent in 2016/17 reflecting the rebound in oil production and exports (up 25 and 75 percent, respectively), and to ease to 3½ percent in 2017/18 as oil production remains at the OPEC target. Thereafter, higher FDI and a gradual improvement in domestic credit conditions as financial reforms proceed drives investment, which combined with improved economic efficiency from updated production capacity, lifts non-oil sector growth. The current account is forecast to remain in surplus as higher exports offset the pick-up in imports related to investment and pent-up domestic demand. Inflation is expected to temporarily rise to 11.9 percent by end-2017/18 reflecting recent liquidity growth and pass-through from exchange rate depreciation, but returns to single digits with prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The pace of job creation lags that needed to absorb the large number of new entrants and unemployment remains high. </P><P MCID="5">12.      Risks are to the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix). The renewed uncertainty surrounding the JCPOA, and especially relations with the U.S., could deter investment and trade with Iran and short-circuit the anticipated recovery. If the agreement is derailed, the economy could risk recession. Likewise, any challenges in implementing the FATF action plan could hamper CBRs, especially if counter-measures were re-imposed. Lower oil prices could increase pressure on export and budget revenues, reducing fiscal space. Domestically, failure to garner support for the ambitious reform program, especially banking sector reform, would see inflation rise, banking stress intensify, and growth slow. The complex, intertwined, reform agenda also demands careful coordination and sequencing.  </P><P MCID="6">Government's arrears to banks 1/10.6Bond issuance for settlement of claims of banks on government 2/0.8Use of CBI's revaluation gains for settlement of banks' claims and recapitalization 2/3.5Sources: Iran authorities; and IMF staff estimates.1/ Based on monetary survey data2/ As provisioned in the Law on the Amendment of the 1395 State Budget LawProvisional Estimates for Government's Arrears to Banks and Settlements (Percent of GDP)</P></page>

Low/MediumMedium Term1The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).

The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment but stressed that with the envisaged reforms growth could be much stronger. The reforms anticipated under the Sixth NDP are expected to lift growth to 8 percent. The recent improvement in oil prices and unexploited potential in hydrocarbons—Iran’s proven gas and oil reserves rank second and fourth in the world which alongside the revised oil contract model isattracting new investors—will continue to spur growth beyond 2017/18. The relatively diversified manufacturing and services sectors provide a good spring-board to expand the non-oil sector.

The banking system is fragile. A legacy of government payment arrears, directed and connected lending, and poor risk management practices have left banks’ balance sheets badly impaired and capital positions weak (Figure 4). The authorities’ provisional estimates suggest that a large share of bank assets are frozen in NPLs or non-earning real estate or public enterprise assets. The fact that NPLs can only be written-off after 10 years and when they are 100 percent provisioned encourages banks to rollover loans and helps explain the rapid pace of headline credit growth despite high real interest rates and problems in access to finance (Section D).  </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"></P></page>

Banks’ reliance on CBI funding is growing. So far the banking system has been shielded from systemic risks because of the banks’ funding model that is virtually independent from external finance. State-owned, commercial and specialized banks, and partially privatized banks largely rely on central bank funding to implement government credit directives. Private banks raise funds largely from deposits or special purpose vehicles, and more recently from the new interbank market. Faced with increased balance-sheet pressures, some banks have begun to compete aggressively for deposits, pushing interest rates up for all banks despite caps, and keeping real interest rates high. Interbank market rates remain elevated. Some banks are now reliant on uncollateralized overnight liquidity support from the CBI. In this context, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the CBI to contain overall liquidity growth to sustain low inflation.  </P><P MCID="1">16.      The mission recommended urgent action to restructure and recapitalize banks to safeguard financial stability and bring down high real interest rates.

Ultimately this would require the phasing out of government credit directives and interest subsidies on specialized bank credit facilities to be financed by the budget. </P><P MCID="5"> Stronger supervisory powers. The draft Banking and CBI bills grant the CBI the power to supervise all deposit-taking institutions. The draft Resolution bill would enable the resolution of nonviable banks and provides the Deposit Guarantee Fund the ability to repay insured deposits in a timely manner. These draft laws significantly enhance the CBI’s supervisory powers and could be further strengthened by stronger powers to intervene problem banks early and a broader range of resolution options. A new corporate insolvency framework would allow insolvent corporates to close and sell their assets. Quick passage of these bills, along with additional resources for financial supervision, would allow the restructuring strategy to proceed. It would also enable a transition to Basel capital standards, enhancing financial soundness and transparency. </P><P MCID="6"> Continued securitization of government arrears.

A stronger AML/CFT framework is essential to facilitate banks’ re-connection to the global financial system and expand CBRs. It also enables better detection of proceeds from tax crimes and corruption. Since 2015/16, the authorities have adopted a high level action plan with the FATF and gained affiliation to the Eurasian AML/CFT group as an observer. Dedicated AML/CFT units have been created in all banks. Cash courier and remittance laws, and the by-laws for the CFT law have been drafted. Staff stresses the importance of fully implementing the FATF action plan, enhancing the effectiveness of the framework by improving understanding of ML/TF risks, improving identification of beneficial owners of accounts and legal entities,2 enhancing measures to identify politically exposed persons, and moving to risk-based AML/CFT supervision. </P><P MCID="2">18.      The authorities agreed on the need for swift action. They are working on a detailed road map to implement banking reform, and have requested IMF technical assistance. The Banking and CBI Bills should be approved by parliament by mid-2017. They underscored the need for broad political consensus to tackle problem banks and alleviate banks from the burden of fiscal activities. The authorities attach high priority to sustainably reducing high real interest rates, which have risen as inflation moderated, through banking reform. They reiterated their strong commitment to strengthen the AML/CFT framework which they see as essential for transparency and access to the international financial system. Nonetheless, they stressed that their continued problems in establishing CBRs with larger banks requires greater attention and international support. </P><P MCID="3">B.   Anchoring Low and Stable Inflation: Strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework </P><P MCID="4">19.      Iran’s monetary policy framework does not provide the CBI adequate tools to keep inflation low and stable. In the presence of underdeveloped financial markets, weak transmission mechanisms and ‘quasi-fiscal’ credit directives, it is difficult for the CBI to align liquidity growth with the production potential of the economy. Injection and withdrawal of liquidity is controlled by rationing. The CBI balance sheet is primarily driven by its loans to banks given the policy of credit support to specific sectors, the government’s overdraft facility, and liquidity support to distressed banks (Figure 5). In the near term, the government should sharply reduce its directed credit schemes and adjust regulated prices to curb liquidity pressures and contain the risk of pass-through from recent exchange rate deprecation. This would also free-up credit available for more productive firms. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">2 Access to beneficial ownership information would allow correspondent banks to lower their compliance costs in ensuring they do not conduct business with Iranian entities or persons on the sanctions list. </P></page>

The CBI requires greater independence and market-based instruments to sustain low and stable inflation. The draft Central Bank Bill overhauls the monetary policy framework, making low and stable inflation the CBI’s main objective. However, to bolster CBI independence to achieve its new mandate, the bill should eliminate the positions for government representatives and nonexperts on the central bank’s governing committees. A lender of last resort framework also needs to be clearly defined—with the CBI’s liquidity facilities collateralized to minimize risks to its balance sheet—and targeted to solvent banks. A target inflation range—the authorities’ objective is to keep inflation below 10 percent—tools to manage liquidity such as central bank participation or government paper, and a clear communication plan will all have to be developed to build the CBI’s credibility to manage interest rates and control inflation (SIP, chapter 2).  </P><P MCID="1">21.      The mission recommends an early move to unify the exchange rate and shift to a managed float given the need for flexibility to manage external shocks. Staff analysis suggests the market rate is better aligned with fundamentals (Appendix I). The official rate subsidizes select imports and does little to insulate inflation given pass-through from the depreciation in the market rate. Unification would increase the value of oil proceeds in domestic currency terms and improve the budget balance. It would also eliminate the economic distortions and potential rent-seeking that arise under the dual rate system, promote competitiveness and non-oil exports, and afford the CBI somewhat greater space to smooth pressures on the market rate. Stronger monetary and fiscal policies would underpin credibility and support a stable exchange rate under the new regime. The exact timing of unification has to be cognizant of FX market conditions and the extent of access to international reserves.  </P><P MCID="2">22.      The authorities see the new central bank bill as key to sustaining low inflation especially as they move to a unified exchange rate regime. Parliamentary committees are working to build political consensus for greater operational independence for the CBI. They noted that the success of the new system hinges on prudent fiscal policy.  The securitization of government arrears offered an opportunity to create monetary policy instruments. The authorities saw the market rate as having overshot somewhat in the wake of seasonal factors and increased uncertainty. They remain committed to the unification of the exchange rate. They continue to shift goods to the bureau market, albeit at a slower pace due to recent FX volatility, and are encouraging FX transactions to move to banks through tighter regulation of FX bureaus. However, because CBRs constrain access to reserves, the CBI’s ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market is curtailed. Against this backdrop, the authorities express their commitment to unify the exchange rate by end-February 2018 as access to reserves improves.  </P><P MCID="3">C.   Fiscal Policy Reform to Promote Faster Inclusive Growth </P><P MCID="4">23.      Fiscal policy has to adapt to the spending pressures arising from balance sheet repair while finding space to support growth. Interest payments are set to rise from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2016/17 to about 3 percent over the medium-term reflecting securitization of government arrears. However, the bonds required for bank recapitalization—the amount and terms of which will only be determined once an AQR is conducted—will add further pressure to the debt burden and interest bill. Additional budgetary investment spending of about 1½ percent of GDP a year would help upgrade infrastructure and support growth. Pressure on the social security system is also rising </P></page>

At the same time, the overall level of the fiscal deficit and the fiscal stance needs to be prudent to support low inflation and rebuild buffers.  </P><P MCID="1">24.      A medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) that targets a gradual adjustment in the non-oil fiscal deficit by creating space, primarily via domestic revenue mobilization, balances these needs (SIP, chapter 3). Although public debt is set to rise above 40 percent of GDP as new debt is issued to clear government liabilities, it remains sustainable and robust to shocks (Appendix II). With ample, long-lasting oil resources, Iran has some space to target a gradual adjustment in the non-oil </P><P MCID="2">fiscal deficit to the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) norm of 5.6 percent of non-oil GDP over the long-term (Figure 6). This balances the need to support growth and keeps debt manageable and in-line with the capacity of the nascent domestic debt market (Iran lacks access to international debt markets). However, given the additional spending pressures discussed above, including arrears clearance </P><P MCID="3">and potential costs of bank recapitalization, additional measures of about 7¼ percent of non-oil GDP should be identified over the next five years to contain the non-oil deficit in the range of 12 percent of non-oil GDP to support low inflation and underpin the credibility of the monetary policy framework. After 2021/22 further measures would be needed to reduce the non-oil deficit to the PIH norm to create savings for future generations. A comprehensive financing plan and improved cash management would avoid arrears and recourse to CBI’s and banks’ balance sheets to implement off-budget fiscal initiatives.  </P><P MCID="4">25.      The government should revisit its oil revenue management strategy, with the view of funding banking sector reform and creating buffers. Currently, 65 percent of oil revenue goes to the central government’s budget while one-fifth goes the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) that on-lends these funds to banks to fund private sector investment.3 Directing a greater proportion of oil revenues to the budget could help fund the prospective additional interest burden arising from bank recapitalization. Using a portion of NDFI assets (10 percent of GDP) to replenish the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) would provide the budget a buffer to safeguard spending levels in the event of a shock. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">3 The remainder is kept by the NIOC for exploration and operating costs. </P><P MCID="6">2014/152015/162016/172017/182018/192019/202020/212021/22PIH norm on the non-oil fiscal balance-5.6-5.6-5.6-5.6-5.6-5.6-5.6-5.6Non-oil balance as a result of spending pressures-11.0-11.5-13.4-14.8-16.2-17.4-18.1-18.8Key contributors6.212.313.214.014.715.415.716.1Interest payment0.10.10.91.61.72.12.42.5Investment spending (including NDFI)6.15.55.65.76.36.66.76.9Staff assessment on non-oil balance to support disinflation and a gradual adjustment to the PIH norm-11.0-11.5-13.4-13.4-12.8-12.3-11.5-11.6Options to create fiscal space 1/………1.51.91.71.50.6Tax revenue………-0.20.90.90.90.3Primary current spending………1.00.50.40.30.1Subsidies reform………0.70.60.50.40.3Other measures………-0.1-0.1-0.1-0.1-0.1Cumulated impact………1.53.35.16.67.2Source: Iran authorities, and IMF staff projections.1/ Staff estimates of permanent measures to be taken every year.Projections(percent of non-oil GDP)Staff's Assessment of Fiscal Space and Spending Pressures, 2014/15-2021/22</P></page>

Expanding domestic revenues and improving the composition and efficiency of spending would ensure the adjustment is growth-friendly and protects the poor (Figure 7). The government aims to increase tax revenue from 7 to 10 percent of GDP. This will require a broader tax base (Box 2) and improved administration. Raising the VAT rate—which is less distortive to investment and savings than personal or corporate income taxes—can compensate for the revenue lost from the corporate tax incentives and the cut in personal income tax rates approved in 2016/17. Generous tax incentives and exemptions can be rationalized and steps taken to revised the income tax code to safeguard against the risk of base erosion (SIP, Chapter 4). Re-organizing the Iran National Tax Authority by taxpayer groups and creating within it a risk management unit would bolster taxpayer compliance.  </P><P MCID="1">27.      Better targeting of cash transfers would create space for growth-supporting investment spending and improve equity.4 Fuel subsidies have been eliminated on gasoline owing to recent domestic price adjustments and favorable movements in international prices.

The authorities emphasized their commitment to prudent fiscal policy. Their ultimate aim is to ensure that current government spending is fully funded by non-oil revenue and that oil resources are used for investment or saved. Although they have not reinstated the OSF, in the wake of low oil prices they have reduced the share of oil receipts going to the NDFI to allow the budget’s share to rise. If the oil price were to rise above the budgeted amount of $55 per bbl., the additional revenues would be saved. While the authorities have yet to formulate a MTFF, they aim to mobilize domestic revenue through improved tax administration.

Improving Revenue Mobilization in Iran </P><P MCID="1"></P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="2">With the introduction of VAT in 2008, the development of a modern tax system is underway. Indirect taxes are growing but direct taxes still account for almost half of total tax revenues, with corporate income taxes (CIT) accounting for 36 percent. A number of changes can bring the tax system in-line with international practice and mobilize revenue:  </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="3"> Gradually raise VAT rates and rationalize the system. The VAT rate remains low despite its increase </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="4">from 3 to 9 percent. The integrity of the VAT can be strengthened by (i) removing the large number of exemptions (e.g. immovable property); (ii) re-introducing a VAT threshold that excludes small businesses who yield little revenue and capture them under a simple turnover tax; and (iii) bringing agriculture—which comprises for one-tenth of GDP but is outside all tax nets—under the VAT by introducing a sector-specific threshold. This would help capture sales by larger agribusinesses.  </P><P MCID="5"> Separate the top VAT rates into an excise and </P><P MCID="6">VAT component and apply the VAT to excise-inclusive prices. At present, the 9 percent VAT rate is supplemented by higher rates on cigarettes and tobacco (12 percent) and vehicle fuels (20 percent). The latter mimics excises for consumers but when these goods are used as a production input their prices do not include these taxes because they are refunded under the VAT, leading to significant revenue loss.  </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="7"> Increase and broaden excises. Excise rates are low by international standards. There is scope to raise rates, shift to easier-to-administer specific rates, and introduce new excises, e.g., on beverages and telecommunications. Introducing ad-valorem excises on motor vehicles would address environmental goals, supplement revenue, and enhance tax progressivity. </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">Shift investment </P><P MCID="10">incentives from profit to cost</P><P MCID="11">-</P><P MCID="12">based measures</P><P MCID="13">. </P><P MCID="14">Profit</P><P MCID="15">-</P><P MCID="16">based investment tax </P><P MCID="17">incentives</P><P MCID="18">—</P><P MCID="19">income </P><P MCID="20">exemptions, reduced rates, tax holidays</P><P MCID="21">—</P><P MCID="22">have proliferated under the CIT and are often </P><P MCID="23">open</P><P MCID="24">-</P><P MCID="25">ended.

Global Competitiveness indicators shows shortfalls in financial market development, labor market efficiency, and technological readiness. These constraints, combined with the large role of the state, result in a low employment elasticity of non-oil growth (just 0.2). The labor market is unable to absorb new entrants—which average half a million annually over the next five years—with youth and women facing the greatest challenges. The unemployment rate exceeds 12 percent, with female and youth unemployment at 21 and almost 30 percent, respectively.

Better coordination with the private sector would better align the education and training system to the skills needs of employers. Revisions to the labor code can address the rigidities in regulations—such as high job protection and benefits to those who are employed for more than a year—that deter job creation and longer-term work contracts. Consideration could be given to offering firms a temporary tax credit (or reduction in payroll taxes) for new hires funded by new budgetary resources or savings, pending a pension reform that tackles high social security contribution rates. </P><P MCID="2">31.      Job creation is at the heart of the authorities’ growth strategy. The NDP bill in parliament anticipates concrete steps—e.g., permitting the public sector companies to procure services from the private sector—to improve the regulatory environment for private firms. The authorities noted that discussions have started on the broad reform of the labor code anticipated under the NDP to remove constraints to hiring and firing for permanent contracts. To improve the match between labor supply and demand, they are seeking to improve the quality and relevance of education and training through greater private sector involvement and the introduction of entrepreneurship courses in the education curriculum.

The exchange rate regime gives rise to several multiple currency practices (MCPs) and an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.

The challenge now is to create the conditions for sustained stability and growth. Renewed uncertainty underscores the importance of advancing reforms to lessen Iran’s reliance on oil, develop the private sector, and build buffers. Rapid and resolute implementation of the authorities’ comprehensive reform plan would help meet these goals. Priority should be given to the restructuring and recapitalization of banks to sustain financial stability and fund growth. This would also alleviate liquidity pressures, help safeguard low and stable inflation, and facilitate the transition to a new monetary policy framework and managed float. Fiscal policy needs to create space to fund these reforms and support growth. Structural reforms that facilitate foreign investment such as improvements in the transparency of corporate ownership would ease domestic financing constraints as banking reform proceed. Reducing the role of the state and improving the business climate would aid job creation.  </P><P MCID="4">36.      Banking reform is now urgent to sustain financial stability and reduce high lending rates. Distressed banks require enhanced supervision. An AQR would identify viable banks that warrant recapitalization and nonviable banks to be resolved.

Quick approval of the new banking and resolution bills would give the CBI the supervisory powers to implement the reform and help it safeguard financial soundness.  </P><P MCID="5">37.      Prudent fiscal policy and liquidity growth are critical to keep inflation well anchored and permit exchange rate unification.

Staff urges quick passage of the Central Bank bill to modernize the monetary policy framework and provide greater operational independence to the CBI to pursue low and stable inflation.

The official exchange rate is moderately overvalued. The bureau rate is 15 percent more depreciated than the official rate.

Overview  </P><P MCID="3">1.       The current account position has remained in surplus, despite the sharp drop in oil prices, due to the rapid rebound in oil exports, and strengthening non-oil exports (e.g., automobiles and petrochemicals) following the lifting of sanctions (Table 1). The current account surplus is expected to decline over the medium-term but remain in modest surplus, reflecting the increase in imports to meet investment needs and consumer demand.1 The financial account is poised to improve, reflecting large FDI commitments and Iran’s gradual reconnection to the global financial system. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies are expected to preserve external stability by avoiding excessive exchange rate fluctuations and containing real appreciation pressures from higher oil exports and increasing private sector demand. </P><P MCID="4">2.      External buffers are adequate but limited CBRs hamper reserve management. To address the latter, Iran has reached agreements with some countries to convert its dollar reserves and export earnings into other currencies and is increasingly denominating its oil sales contracts in euros.  The uncertain outlook for oil prices, the impact of remaining sanctions, and risk of snap-back sanctions under the JCOPA pose risks to Iran’s external position. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">1 Iran will import new aircrafts to replace its aged commercial fleet and is investing in the modernization of oil refining, petrochemical and manufacturing production capacity, </P></page>

External Sector Vulnerabilities </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2"></P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4"></P><P MCID="5">Background. Current account surpluses shrunk from just over 6 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 2.4 percent in 2015/16 due to the decline in oil exports and sanctions. However, oil exports have now recovered to pre-sanctions levels and non-oil exports grew by $21.6 billion in the first eight months of FY 2016/17. The main exported items apart from oil include gas condensates, liquefied gas and autos.Assessment. The current account remains in surplus. Expanding non-oil exports will be crucial to reduce Iran’s dependency on oil revenue, contain the impact of rising imports, and build external buffers.Background. Iran has a dual exchange rate system: an official rate for imports of select priority goods, and a bureau, market-determined rate for all other transactions.  The CBI has shifted about half of goods categories and all services from the official to bureau market, most recently moving imports of wheat and food products to the bureau market. Assessment. The real effective exchange rate calculated using the official rate is overvalued. However, uncertainty around oil prices and sanctions complicate the assessment. The government plans to unify the exchange rate and move to a managed float which could eliminate the overvaluation. Background. Iran’s economy was cut-off from global financial markets due to international sanctions until January 2016. However, FDI flows are returning, mostly in oil and gas sectors and automotives.Assessment. The capital account is small. One major challenge hampering the development of the capital account is the reconnection of Iranian banks to the international financial system reflecting both the impact of remaining sanctions and need to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and weak domestic banks.Background. Iran’s foreign exchange assets/reserves stood at $128 billion at end-March 16, equivalent to 19 months of importsand 40 percent of broad money. Post JCPOA implementation, Iran has been able to access more of its reserves, but challenges remain.  Iran is increasingly settling its trade in euros (notably for oil) and converting its reserves to currencies other than the US dollar.Assessment. The level of gross foreign exchange assets is comfortable.Background. Gross external debt is low, around 2 percent of GDP. Foreign assets of the banking system, including the CBI, are equivalent to about 50 percent of GDP. However, a non-negligible share of foreign assets are reported to be frozen or encumbered even after sanctions relief.  Assessment. IIP data are not disseminated. In recent years, the compilation of data has been very difficult owing to challenges in tracking foreign assets.

Exchange Rate Assessment </P><P MCID="1">3.      The exchange rate assessment points to a moderate overvaluation in the official exchange rate of about 5–7 percent. The bureau rate is 15 percent more depreciated than the official rate. The unification of the exchange rate would be expected to result in the exchange rate settling between the current official and market rates, which in turn, would likely make the unified rate broadly in line with fundamentals.  </P><P MCID="2"> Current account approach. The REER is moderately overvalued by 5.7 percent. The current account balance (CA) in 2015 of 2.1 percent of GDP is below the norm of 2.9 percent of GDP. The two main drivers of the CA norm in Iran are labor productivity and the fiscal position. A widening fiscal deficit and comparatively low productivity has left the CA surplus weaker than the norm. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies would contain inflation and aid competitiveness.

A key issue is the coverage of financial flows associated with export proceeds of the petrochemical sector. These proceeds are likely held in deposits abroad for which no information is available; and this results in unrecorded counter entries to the exports recorded in the current account (goods). Steps should be taken to collect this information directly from the companies. Inward direct investment (DI) statistics are compiled by the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI) whose work is focused on investment approvals for the nonoil sector. The recording of actual investment inflows could be improved; and the use of DI surveys should be explored to address possible gaps, including reinvested earnings.  </P><P MCID="15"></P></page>

<page id="63" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><P MCID="0">Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Iran </P><P MCID="1">February 24, 2017 </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">My Iranian authorities thank staff for the high-quality engagement and policy advice under the 2016 Article IV consultation. They are also grateful for the Fund’s technical assistance that has complemented their own efforts at economic reforms. They broadly concur with staff analysis and policy recommendations, and look forward to continued close dialogue and collaboration with the Fund in the period ahead. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">Overview  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Building on its hallmark achievement of signing and implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which paved the way for the lifting of international nuclear sanctions on January 16, 2016, President Rouhani’s administration has made significant progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, improving fiscal management, advancing growth-enhancing structural reforms, and promoting Iran’s reintegration into the global economic and financial system. This has enhanced confidence, as evidenced by increased private sector activity and the re-engagement of foreign investors with their Iranian counterparts, which together with increased oil production, has helped boost growth, strengthen the external and fiscal positions, and lower inflation. Iran’s return to the oil market and its participation in the recent OPEC agreement have had a stabilizing impact on the oil market. </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">My authorities believe that the lifting of sanctions and their ambitious reform agenda are yet to produce their full beneficial impact on the Iranian economy and positive regional and global spillover effects. Indeed, the economy is still some distance away from fully tapping its huge investment and trade potential, given its vast hydrocarbon reserves, relatively diversified non-oil sector, large domestic market, and young and well-educated labor force. Regrettably, remaining US sanctions and related uncertainty have hindered the return of global banks to the Iranian market and continue to hamper large-scale investment and trade. My authorities remain fully committed to their international obligations, including under the JCPOA and to FATF. They will persevere with their reform agenda to make the economy more resilient to external shocks, while expecting that the remaining constraints to Iran’s reintegration into the global economic and financial system will be eliminated soon.  </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">Recent Economic Developments and Outlook </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">The economy has staged a remarkable turnaround from last year’s recession, aided by a swift recovery in oil production and exports to pre-sanctions levels, and facilitated by Iranian banks’ partial reintegration into the global financial system. Growth is estimated to have rebounded to about 7 percent for the current Iranian year 2016/17 with oil production back to close to full potential and recovery in non-oil activity.

However, although 667,000 new jobs were created in 2015/16, the unemployment rate has continued to hover around 11 percent and may have inched upwards in the current fiscal year, given the large number of new entrants into the labor market due to demographic factors and increased labor force participation. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Prudent fiscal policy over the past 5 years has kept the budget deficit low in spite of challenging circumstances marked by the oil embargo and price decline. Non-oil deficit of the central government to non-oil GDP in 2016/17 is estimated to widen from 9.0 percent of GDP to 10.6 percent, as improved tax and other non-oil revenue may not fully offset higher interest payments and transfers to the Targeted Subsidy Organization (TSO), which administers revenues from domestic fuel sales to finance cash transfers. Public debt-to-GDP ratio, which increased sharply from 12 percent to 42 percent in 2015/16, mainly as a result of recognition of government arrears and their securitization, is estimated to decline to 35 percent in 2016/17 and to 29 percent next year. However, it could rise again above 40 percent of GDP after full recognition of remaining government arrears and their securitization and issuance of securities for bank capitalization, but would nonetheless remain moderate, sustainable, and robust to shocks, as indicated by staff. The current account surplus is projected to increase to over 6 percent of GDP owing to higher oil export volumes, more favorable oil prices, and continued strong growth in non-oil exports. International reserves are comfortable at the equivalent of 20 months of imports, 40 percent of broad money, and 15 times the total external debt, even though access to reserves, while improving, remains somewhat constrained. The foreign exchange market has been broadly stable and the spread between the official and the market rates stands at about 15 percent.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">My authorities are cognizant of the downside risks to the near- and medium-term outlook and are determined to steadfastly pursue sound policies to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability and promote inclusive growth. They will do the utmost to garner broad public and political support for their ambitious reform agenda, which is outlined in the draft Sixth Five Year Development Plan (6FYDP: 2017/18 – 2021/22) bill currently under discussion in the parliament.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Against this background, my authorities remain committed to strengthening the underlying fiscal position by reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit, anchoring low and stable inflation, unifying the exchange rate, ensuring a solid banking sector, and advancing structural reforms to foster private sector development, job creation, and high and sustainable growth. Critical reforms in these areas will allow Iran to tap its huge potential in proven oil and gas reserves (4th and 2nd largest in the world, respectively), further develop its well-diversified manufacturing and services sectors, and attract private capital inflows in the hydrocarbon, automobile, aviation, telecom, and tourism industries, among others. </P></page>
<page id="65" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><Artifact Attached="[/Top]" Subtype="/Header" Type="/Pagination">3 </Artifact><P MCID="0">My authorities have cleared virtually all unintended arrears to export credit agencies, and are diligently working on strengthening the AML/CFT framework. However, they remain concerned that renewed uncertainty regarding US sanctions, lingering memories of large fines imposed by the US on international banks that conduct business with Iran, and continued US dollar clearing restrictions, could continue to hamper the re-establishment of corresponding banking relations (CBRs) with large global banks, and potentially deter investment and trade with Iran. Should CBRs be fully re-established, and U-Turn mechanism for US dollar clearing reinstated, the envisaged reforms foreseen in the 6FYDP could help deliver significantly higher rates of growth over the medium term than those projected by staff. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Fiscal Policy </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Higher oil revenue will facilitate gradual fiscal consolidation and create space for spending pressures associated with arrears securitization, bank restructuring and recapitalization, and key infrastructure and social outlays. The 2017/18 budget submitted to the parliament targets a zero balance for both the central government and the TSO. The authorities remain focused on lowering the non-oil deficit, consistent with their ultimate goal to fully fund current spending from non-oil revenue and use the oil resources for investment or building fiscal buffers. The planned fiscal adjustment seeks to increase non-oil tax collection to 10 percent of GDP and improve the composition and efficiency of spending. On the revenue side, efforts will be directed at broadening the tax base, gradually raising VAT rates, rationalizing personal and corporate income tax rates, and strengthening tax and customs administration to bolster compliance. On the expenditure side, the authorities will continue to lower the budgetary cost of fuel subsidies by adjusting domestic fuel prices, in line with international price movements, and removing high-income households from the cash transfer beneficiary list, which would make room for raising the allocation to the poorest segments of the population and improving equity. However, progress in this area will be faster once ongoing efforts at removing administrative difficulties in identifying and means-testing these households are completed. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">My authorities agree on the need to cast the government’s budget in a medium-term fiscal framework, better articulate fiscal objectives in the FYDPs, make the non-oil primary balance the main fiscal anchor, strengthen the link between the FYDPs and the annual budgets, and enhance coordination between key government entities in charge of budget preparation and implementation. They are benefiting from the newly-established treasury single account and phased introduction of accrual accounting. They are aware of the potential financial sector contingencies, as highlighted in the report, and are working toward allocating more resources for the prospective restructuring and recapitalization of the banking sector. Moreover, the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) could be used to finance priority projects in deprived areas, for which private sector funding is usually unavailable, thereby alleviating investment spending pressures on the budget.

Inflation has been gradually reduced over the past three years as a result of sound macroeconomic policies. However, a combination of factors may work in the opposite direction, including in particular the recent pickup in monetary expansion stemming from banks’ increased reliance on central bank (CBI) overdraft facility, the government drawing on its revolving facility, selective reduction in statutory reserve requirements from 13 to 10 percent, based on banks’ asset quality and risk management, CBI’s injection of liquidity through the interbank market to reduce high interbank rates, and the high pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to CPI inflation. While inflation might temporarily rise above 10 percent by end 2017/18, the authorities are confident that prudent policies will help contain overall liquidity growth and bring inflation back to single digits. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">The overhaul of the monetary policy framework, as envisaged under the draft CBI bill, would help refocus CBI’s legal mandate on low and stable inflation and entrench macroeconomic stability. The bill also strengthens governance of the CBI, and mandates full repayment of all the funds the government receives from CBI by the end of the same fiscal year. My authorities agree on the need to enhance CBI’s operational autonomy, collateralize liquidity facilities, define a target inflation range, broaden market-based liquidity management tools, and develop a clear communication policy. They appreciate staff work on the reform of the monetary policy framework, and welcome their reflection on the draft CBI and banking bills to ensure compliance with international best practices. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">My authorities remain committed to unifying the exchange rate and returning to a managed float regime, expected to take place by end February 2018, once relations with foreign correspondent banks are normalized and full access to reserves restored. They continue to shift priority goods imports to the bureau market rate, and to encourage foreign exchange transactions to move to banks. These efforts, however, have not been facilitated by the limited access to international reserves, which has curtailed CBI’s ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market, as needed, to reduce the bureau market rate premium over the official exchange rate. Exchange rate unification, would help address the moderate overvaluation in the official exchange rate and make the unified rate broadly in line with fundamentals. </P><P MCID="9"> </P></page>

Compounded by external shocks, reflected in reduced CBRs and less efficient financial services delivery, this has resulted in capital shortages, compressed liquidity, low profitability, and deteriorated asset quality. Realizing the important challenges ahead, the authorities are determined to safeguard financial stability by resolving NPLs, bolstering capital and provisions, enhancing supervision, and strengthening the AML/CFT framework. The audit of government arrears is underway and marketable government securities are being issued to settle payment arrears; dividend payments have been restricted to protect bank capital, and higher provisions have been mandated; unlicensed financial institutions (UFIs) are brought under CBI supervision and problem UFIs have been closed or merged with banks, and IFRS reporting standards have been implemented. Moreover, the CFT law has been adopted, dedicated AML/CFT units have been created in all banks, and the ongoing implementation of an action plan agreed with FATF has led to the suspension of countermeasures for a period of twelve months. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">The draft banking and resolution bills, which are being merged, aim at restructuring and recapitalizing banks, enhancing the CBI’s supervisory powers, and enabling the resolution of nonviable banks. While the bills to overhaul the banking system are being finalized, the ongoing aggressive competition among banks for deposits has resulted in sustained elevated real interest rates and has prompted CBI to formulate and announce, under its existing legal mandate, a 10-point action plan to address the issue. The plan includes active management of the interbank market, increased use of open market operations for liquidity provision, classifying banks based on their supervisory data, adjusting the statutory reserve requirements, improving risk management practices in banks, regulating the UFIs, increasing banks’ capital, reducing NPLs, merging or resolving insolvent banks and credit institutions, and improving bank oversight. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">My authorities agree on the need to act decisively and expeditiously to strengthen regulation and supervision within the existing powers. Accordingly, and in line with staff recommendation, they intend to launch an asset quality review; revise regulations on asset classification and provisioning, liquidity provision, reporting, and monitoring; and enforce compliance with prudential regulations, while ensuring that CBI’s overdraft facility is only used to build up banks’ liquidity buffers. In the same vein, the authorities would initiate implementation of the roadmap to Basel II/III. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Structural Reforms </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The structural reforms agenda—envisioned under the 6FYDP—targets higher sustainable growth and stronger pace of job creation.

The 6FYDP, consistent with the 20-year Vision Document, also highlights the need to address challenges ahead in water resource management, environment protection, and pension reform. Gradual reconnection to the global economic and financial system should facilitate FDI inflows to high-productivity sectors and companies and ease domestic financing constraints. The authorities attach high priority to creating employment opportunities for a growing number of university graduates who enter the job market over the next five years, and have taken steps to better align the education and training system with skill needs of employers, including introduction of entrepreneurship courses in the education curriculum.
