Growth is likely to pick up modestly to about 2 percent in 2017, with private consumption continuing to be a main driver supported by a steady labor market. The current account surplus remained below 3 percent of GDP, and is projected to improve to around 3.5 percent over the medium term as the global economy recovers.  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">With a more challenging external environment, with the U.S. rate cycle moving up, global trade growth tepid and Mainland China rebalancing, the growth recovery may be gradual. Over the longer term aging pressures may weaken the structural fiscal position, requiring fiscal planning to alleviate the decline; and a housing supply shortage also needs to be tackled.  </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn on to weather a less favorable environment. Fiscal reserves amount to 35 percent of GDP or 23 months of expenditures and the net international investment position is positive at 355 percent of GDP. The banks are capitalized well above Basel III levels; liquidity cover and the use of stable funding have increased. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) provides a credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally integrated financial services industry exposed to cross-border flows.  </P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="17">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Growth has slowed since 2015 and the external outlook is more challenging with the U.S. rate cycle is edging up, global trade growth tepid and mainland China rebalancing. With soft external conditions, the growth recovery is likely to be gradual with the output gap closing slowly. Over the medium term population aging pressures may affect potential growth and weaken the structural fiscal position. On the upside, the economy is highly flexible and large potential can be tapped from the further development of Hong Kong SAR as a global financial center. Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), provides a credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally integrated financial services industry. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland China’s growth prospects spill over to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a large globally integrated financial sector and a currency board arrangement, the economy is exposed to U.S. developments and global market volatility. The property market is also a source of downside risk. With strong buffers in place these risks are manageable and should not adversely affect the economy provided that, as anticipated, interest rates rise at a moderate pace and mainland China’s transition to a more sustainable growth path remains orderly.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Fiscal policy. As the main demand management lever, fiscal policy needs to strike a balance between supporting aggregate demand and preserving a buffer for the longer-run challenge posed by aging. In the near term with a significant and persistent output gap, a difficult external environment, and weak automatic stabilizers, there is a case for further fiscal impetus which can be removed as the economy recovers. The planned impulse in the 2016–17 Budget is appropriate but if it undershoots and growth remains weak, additional stimulus will be needed in fiscal year 2017–18. Aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward would help ensure that cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend. </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the 2014 Report on Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing expenditures to measures that boost labor participation and support growth, raising revenues and managing assets would help alleviate the fiscal impact of aging. Measures to broaden the tax base may also be needed. The aim for balance and keeping overall government expenditure growth in line with GDP growth over the medium term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate the structural deficit problem. A drawdown of the fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy adjusts, but a positive fiscal buffer is desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy, and sustain confidence.  </P><P MCID="10"> </P></page>

With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the three pronged approach to limiting risks—boosting housing supply, macroprudential measures to limit stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand— is well placed. Current macroprudential settings have done their job of limiting financial system exposure to the asset price boom and LTV and DSR settings should remain unchanged. Stamp duties can be an effective part of the toolkit to stem excessive price increases and speculation in the real estate market. As the distorting costs of duties become more significant the higher they are, they should be rolled back once the trend has shifted toward reduced price and speculative pressures.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Housing supply. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are aimed at addressing the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and infrastructure development. Accelerating plans to increase supply, speeding up processes, making land available, bringing forward public investment would be a double win—tackling the housing problem and supporting the economy at a time of soft growth. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help limit the buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. The authorities have a track record as a global standard setter in regulation and supervision and in addressing data gaps. Substantial progress has been made on implementing the 2014 FSAP recommendations. An independent insurance authority has been established, strengthened standards for securities listing have been implemented, and legislation has been put in place for a resolution framework for financial institutions which is designed to implement the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes. There is substantial coordination among government and regulators domestically, there are close links with mainland regulators and the authorities are active in international fora, including in supervisory colleges for cross border banking and insurance groups, on global systemically important financial institutions, and in crisis management groups. Areas for continued attention include further enhancing stress testing and reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Exchange rate regime and external position. The LERS remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR backed by the credibility built up over three decades and tested through crises. The LERS is underpinned by the flexible economy, ample reserves buffers and strong financial regulation and supervision. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to cyclical conditions and structural change. The external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Contingency planning. As a trading hub and global financial center, the economy is inevitably exposed to global external shocks. In the event of an adverse shock, a comprehensive and coordinated policy approach similar to the 2008/9 response would be appropriate: including large fiscal stimulus, loosening of macroprudential policies, expanded credit guarantees, emergency liquidity provision and close international supervisory coordination. The recently introduced crisis resolution framework is strengthening the ability to respond to strains in the banking, corporate and household sectors </P><P MCID="9"> </P></page>

The vibrant Hong Kong SAR economy has been supported by low interest rates and mainland China’s economic development over the past decade. But the external outlook is now more challenging. Long-term issues such as aging and a housing supply shortage also loom. Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn on when needed.  </P><P MCID="4"> Policies. To address the challenges and provide a platform for sustained growth:  </P><P MCID="5"> Fiscal position. A fiscal impulse broadly in line with the 2016/17 budget, and some additional next year, to support the economy through subdued conditions. </P><P MCID="6"> Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the 2014 Report on Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing expenditures to measures that boost labor participation and support growth, raising revenues and managing assets to help alleviate the fiscal impact of aging.  </P><P MCID="7"> Exchange rate regime. The strong policy framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System, together with flexibility and ample buffers, should be preserved.  </P><P MCID="8"> Property market. The three-pronged strategy to the property market (boosting supply, macroprudential policies to manage risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand) should remain in place.  </P><P MCID="9"> Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help limit the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities. Exposures to mainland China and rapid growth of the asset management industry continue to merit close supervisory attention. Enhancing stress testing and reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events are crucial for maintaining financial stability. </P><P MCID="10"> Potential. There are opportunities to further develop Hong Kong SAR’s role as a global financial center building on its comparative advantages.  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"></P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">December 19, 2016 </P></page>

Hong Kong SAR is a vibrant trading and financial gateway between mainland China and the rest of the world. Traditionally the economy was mainly driven by the United States, the global economic cycle and financial conditions; but over time it has become increasingly linked to mainland China’s rapidly evolving economy. The financial services industry ranks fourth in the Global Financial Centers Index and fourth by scale of foreign exchange turnover. Four industries—financial services, tourism, trading and logistics, and </P><P MCID="6">professional and other producer services—account for over half of GDP and employ just under half of the workforce. Financial services accounts for around 18 percent of value added but just 7 percent of employment.  </P><P MCID="7">2.      Prolonged low interest rates and mainland China’s economic development have supported growth and credit over the past decade. With positive spillovers from mainland China, growth has averaged 4.1 percent between 2005 and 2013 and unemployment has remained low. Credit grew rapidly, house prices nearly tripled between 2008 and 2015 for the mass market and doubled for the luxury segment. </P><P MCID="8">3.      But growth has slowed since 2015 and the outlook is more challenging. The U.S. rate cycle has turned up, global trade growth is tepid and mainland China is rebalancing. Post-election uncertainty about U.S. economic policies has been accompanied by market volatility which may also weigh on trade and financial conditions. Domestically, the tide also appears to be turning with the financial cycle past its peak and swings in the housing market—with a price correction in the early part of the year followed by resurgent demand. In a longer perspective (though no less urgent), the economy needs to adapt to population aging and mainland China’s move up the value chain and a shortage of housing supply relative to demand needs to be addressed. </P><P MCID="9">4.      Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) provides a credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally-integrated financial services industry that is exposed to cross-border portfolio shifts. Fiscal buffers and a positive net international investment position (35 percent and 315 percent of GDP, respectively) enable the economy to navigate shocks. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to cyclical conditions and structural changes. The strong regulatory and supervisory framework is aimed at limiting the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities.  </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">0510152025TourismTrading and LogisticsProfessional and OtherProducerServicesFinancial ServicesPercent of GDPPercent of total employmentShareof Four Key Industries(In percent)Sources: HongKong Monthly Digest of Statistics, March 2016; and IMF staff calculations.</P></page>

The real economy has been operating below trend: </P><P MCID="3"> Subpar growth. Growth has been below potential since the beginning of 2015 and is expected to be around 1.5 percent in 2016. An anemic global trade environment and a sharp downturn in tourism arrivals from mainland China over the past two years have depressed retail spending, private investment and exports. The decline in tourism has shown signs of bottoming out since the middle of the year and consumption has turned around alongside rebounding house prices. Nonetheless, business activity indicators, retail sales, and consumer confidence continue to point to a slow recovery (Figure 1). </P><P MCID="4"> Labor market steady. Labor market quantity indicators have been resilient to slower growth. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.4 percent in Q3 and employment has remained robust, though vacancies have declined. Public construction investment appears to have supported employment. Earnings growth has adjusted, slowing to 3.8 percent in 2016:H1 from 4.3 percent in 2015:H1. CPI inflation has remained contained at 2.1 percent (y/y) in October.  </P><P MCID="5"> Subdued external sector. The real exchange rate has appreciated at a more moderate pace in 2016, in line with the U.S. dollar. After January’s volatile external financial conditions, market sentiment improved and the Hong Kong dollar returned to the strong side of the convertibility undertaking. The current account surplus narrowed to around 2.6 percent of GDP in 2016:H1, and goods trade remained subdued in Q3.  </P><P MCID="6"> Equity markets. The Hang Seng index fell to a four-year low in February 2016 following concerns about China’s growth outlook. More recently, Brexit, post-U.S. election volatility and December’s Fed rate hike, and the imposition of higher property stamp duties also triggered brief market declines, but equities are currently 20 percent higher than February’s trough.  </P><P MCID="7"> Capital flows moved with market volatility. Portfolio investment outflows increased substantially in 2015 as residents and nonresidents reduced their equity and investment fund holdings following the stock market decline. This reversed in 2016:H1 as markets stabilized, and equity and bond inflows have increased since August. However, the shift in expectations from RMB appreciation to depreciation has continued to lead to a sharp reduction in offshore RMB liquidity with deposits down by about 35 percent from the 2014 peak.   </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9">-50-40-30-20-10010200910111213141516H1Portfolio investmentAssetsLiabilitiesPortfolio Investment(In percent of GDP)Sources: Haver Analytics; and IMF staff estimates</P><P MCID="10">-4-20246810122000Q12002Q12004Q12006Q12008Q12010Q12012Q12014Q12016Q1Nominal Wage (year-on-year percentage change)Unemployment Rate (in percent)Nominal Wage and Unemployment Rate(In percent)2016Q3</P></page>

With a softer economic outlook, the 2016/17 Budget included measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises, incentives for the tourism industry, tax cuts and an increase in social security allowances. A fiscal impulse of 1.6 percent of GDP is projected by the authorities for 2016/17, although the actual impulse may fall short of this, as revenues usually out-perform forecasts.  </P><P MCID="1">6.       Signals from the financial cycle are mixed (Figure 2): </P><P MCID="2"> Credit growth has slowed. Lending for use outside Hong Kong SAR fell back in 2016:H1 as mainland Chinese residents repaid external debt, but has since recovered. Domestic lending for wholesale, retail and manufacturing contracted while mortgages and personal loan growth was relatively subdued until the summer. Measures of the credit cycle point to a still positive but narrower credit gap. And respondents to the HKMA Opinion Survey expect a further decline in loan demand.  </P><P MCID="3"> But the property market has rebounded. Residential house prices fell by more than 10 percent in the early part of the year following the first Fed rate hike and amid uncertainty about mainland China’s growth prospects. But prices have since recovered and were just 3.3 percent off the peak in September. Transactions also bounced back with the monthly average in August to October almost doubling compared to the first seven months of this year (Figure 3). The rebound followed growing market conviction, post Brexit, that the pace of U.S. rate tightening would be gradual. House price valuations still look over stretched—with staff models and user cost measures pointing to overvaluation of around 10–20 percent. To contain speculation, in November, the authorities sharply raised the ad valorem stamp duty for residential property transactions to a flat rate of 15 percent from a scale of 1.5–8.5 percent, affecting all nonresidents and residents owning more than one property (see Appendix IV). This took steam out of the market, with shares in property developers falling on the news.  </P><P MCID="4"> The cost of credit is compressed. Price indicators are liquid and competition among mortgage lenders has resulted in mortgage rates being lowered in 2016 and are currently about  2 percent.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Liquidity Map: Quantity Indicators Tightening but Price Indicators Are Liquid </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">Risk appetiteVHSIBalance sheet conditionsCredit spread proxyQuantity indicatorsReal credit growthM2 growthPrice indicatorsEFBN 10-yr-2yr spread3mth HK HIBOR (monetary policy stance)Real discount rate3mth HIBOR-EFBN 3mth spread (TED spread proxy)Prime rate-based mortgage interest rate20162012201320142015Most LiquidLess Liquid</P></page>

Strict macroprudential measures have contained bank exposure to the property boom. Since 2009 limits on loan-to-value ratios, debt service-to-income ratios, higher risk weight floors on property loans, and interest rate buffer stress tests have helped contain exposures. Banks continue to maintain healthy liquidity profiles (the liquidity cover ratio rose to 158 percent in 2016:Q2) and high capital buffers with a CET1 ratio of 15.8 percent. In line with Basel III, The HKMA will raise the countercyclical capital buffer (CCYB) to 1.25 percent of total risk weighted assets from January 2017.

Outlook. The authorities generally agreed with the staff's assessment that the economy could attain further moderate growth next year, notwithstanding an outlook clouded by uncertainties. Fiscal stimulus in the last few budgets was able to provide relief to those at the lower end of the income scale and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) thereby alleviating uncertainty and creating a stable environment. Looking ahead, private consumption and ongoing infrastructure spending would help maintain momentum and support employment. In addition, the resilience of the economy, marked by highly efficient and flexible markets, robust regulatory framework, and sound macroeconomic policy, would enable Hong Kong SAR to sail through the challenges. The authorities were confident that the continuous rebalancing of the Mainland would lend further opportunities and stability to Hong Kong SAR's economy. Over the medium-term, an aging population could impinge on growth, but continued development of Hong Kong SAR as a global financial center, investment in infrastructure and fiscal buffers would help offset the effects.    </P><P MCID="6">RISK</P><P MCID="7">S</P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">TO THE OUTLOOK</P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">11.      There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland China’s growth prospects inevitably spillover to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a large globally-integrated financial sector and a currency board, the economy is also exposed to U.S. developments and global market volatility. The property market is the main domestic source of downside risk.

Connections with mainland China’s economy and the financial sector are important for future growth but also add risk transmission channels. A bumpy mainland China transition to sustainable growth would feed through the tourism, trade and financial channels. </P><P MCID="6">13.      Tourism and trade contribute significantly to activity and employment. A further slowdown in tourism and trade would dent retail sales, logistics and wholesale warehousing. SME links to mainland China are high, and a downturn in profitability combined with higher interest rates could stretch their debt servicing capacity. </P><P MCID="7">14.      Financial linkages have intensified over the past decade. Bank lending to mainland China plus trade finance account for around half of Hong Kong SAR banks’ lending. RMB internationalization, equities market linkages, securities issuance by mainland corporates and asset management activity have all grown.  </P><P MCID="8"> Banking system exposure to mainland banks. External claims on onshore Chinese banks remain sizeable at HK$1.5trillion (62 percent of GDP) (Figure 4). The mainland is the largest systemically important source of potential shock to interbank markets. Banking sector exposure through lending and bond markets expanded rapidly over 2010–2014 as the offshore renminbi market developed and activity was spurred in part by steady gains from RMB appreciation plus the limited options for RMB investments. From late 2014, the change in RMB outlook, lower funding costs onshore, and a fall in RMB deposit pool offshore, led to a scale back in lending to mainland banks. However, the position stabilized in 2016:Q2 and more recent data points to modest pickup in lending to onshore banks once again. </P><P MCID="9"> Banking system exposure to mainland nonfinancial corporates. Hong Kong SAR banks’ nonbank China exposure—a broad measure including lending, off-balance sheet items and trade finance to mainland Chinese firms and overseas firms operating there—remains close to its historically-high level of HK$4.6 trillion (187 percent of GDP). After increasing rapidly since 2010, the rate of growth has eased since 2015 as mainland companies began to repay foreign currency debt, but the level of exposure is still high. HKMA analysis suggests that leverage has been increasing for nonlocal corporates (i.e., mainland China and overseas) since the Global Financial Crisis, and debt at risk is higher than for domestic firms. Still, the HKMA’s stress tests suggest that the potential credit loss for Hong Kong SAR banks from a China growth slowdown remains manageable. Staff’s analysis (Selected Issues Paper 1) provides support for this view, though banks should remain alert to rising credit risk.1,2, </P><P MCID="10">o Hong Kong SAR banks currently have less direct exposure to riskier mainland corporates than the average of A shares.

Hong Kong SAR banks' focus on large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), multinationals operating in mainland China and Hong Kong SAR-based conglomerates suggests that they are also not lending to the weakest listed corporates. A significant proportion of the loan book is also backed by bank guarantees or secured by collateral.  </P><P MCID="1">o  However, continued caution and monitoring remain warranted. Conditions </P><P MCID="2">across banks vary. Some banks are more exposed to mainland SOEs and others to the private sector.

The Mutual Recognition of Funds permits mutual funds in each location to mobilize investment from the other jurisdiction, subject to regulatory approval and an aggregate and daily quota. These schemes boost market activity and enhance liquidity in both markets, and they have prompted closer coordination between the regulators, but they also intensify possible risk transmission between the equities markets. With increased market connections, correlations and spillovers (on returns and volatilities) have been increasing over time across a broad range of sectors.   </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3"> The asset management industry has expanded rapidly with total assets under management almost tripling over the past seven years, although values steadied in 2015.

The authorities are promoting the development of Hong Kong SAR as a global full-service asset management center to enable investors to manage complex risks—including from mainland onshore activity—through risk management products, hedging and derivatives. Legal and tax changes have been made to encourage global corporate treasuries, the private equity industry and open ended funds to domicile in Hong Kong SAR.

Bank exposures to mainland China banks and corporates. The authorities viewed the mainland China-related risks as manageable.

Frequent credit reviews had allowed HKMA to remain attuned to possible vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the introduction of the stable funding requirement and countercyclical buffers meant the banks were well positioned to absorb materializing risks. </P><P MCID="1">16.      RMB offshore business. The authorities attributed the decline in RMB activity to a temporary cyclical shift in expectations from RMB appreciation to depreciation. This resulted in a tightening of liquidity which had led to occasional temporary spikes in the CNH-HIBOR rates. While the episode in January was pronounced and related to uncertainty about the Mainland's growth prospects, September and December's spikes were more contained. In fact, the Hong Kong SAR market remained a net provider of liquidity in the offshore RMB market as a whole, lending RMB to banks in other centers such as Singapore and London. To facilitate the smooth and efficient operation of the offshore RMB money market in Hong Kong SAR, the HKMA had recently expanded the number of primary liquidity providers in the RMB offshore market and its scale; and had introduced disclosure of the usage of intraday and overnight RMB liquidity facilities. Over the longer term asset allocation to the RMB would continue to rise as mainland China continued to open up, and inclusion of the RMB in the SDR basket had been an important step in carrying this forward.   </P><P MCID="2">17.      Asset management industry. The authorities viewed the orderly functioning of markets through episodes of turbulence in mainland China's markets as an indication of the resilience of Hong Kong SAR's financial system. More broadly, Hong Kong SAR's economy would benefit by continuing to play its pivotal role as the financial hub and intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world, as a place to manage onshore China risks, and as an international asset management and offshore RMB center. To make this a success, the authorities were focused on ensuring that the regulatory regime keeps pace and is resilient to fast moving and challenging market conditions. Work was underway to enhance asset management regulation in respect of securities lending and repurchase agreements, custody of fund assets, liquidity risk management and disclosure of leverage by fund managers.  </P><P MCID="3"></P><P MCID="4">U.S. Rate Cycle and Global Market Volatility</P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">18.

Sensitivity to interest rate changes is also likely to be high with over 90 percent of new mortgage loans on floating interest rates. While the debt service index eased to 44 percent in 2016:Q2, sensitivity tests show it would rise sharply to around 60 percent in response to a 300 basis point interest rate shock. Although the buffers built up following macroprudential tightening is likely to ensure that the financial system would be resilient to a sharp house price adjustment, there is a risk to the real economy from an adverse spiral of negative wealth effects, lower collateral values, slower credit growth and weaker household spending.   </P><P MCID="7">Authorities’ Views </P><P MCID="8">21.

Context. Fiscal policy is the main demand management tool, since monetary policy is determined through the direct link to U.S. interest rates through the currency board (LERS). Fiscal policy therefore needs to support economic stabilization, when there is a sizeable output gap and when external demand is weak. With a comfortable level of fiscal reserves, there is scope for near-term support which can be removed as the economy recovers (Figure 6). However, over the longer run the structural fiscal position will weaken as the economy faces rapid population aging with one in six people currently 65 or above rising to one in three by 2034. Pensioner poverty and inequality are also issues that the government is tackling. Fiscal policy needs to balance near-term needs against the longer-term weakening of the structural fiscal position and the commitment, enshrined in the Basic Law, to preserve low taxes and fiscal prudence. This can be achieved by aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward to help ensure that cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend. </P><P MCID="10">Near-Term Fiscal Policy </P><P MCID="11">28.      There is a case for a fiscal stimulus given the soft economic outlook, sizeable output gap, and difficult external environment. The planned fiscal impulse of around 1.6 percent of GDP in the 2016‒17 Budget is therefore appropriate and there would be room for further easing in 2017/18, possibly to total a cumulative 2 percent of GDP over the two fiscal years. However, based on past conservative performance, staff’s baseline projection is that the actual fiscal impulse will turn out to be lower than this and close to zero in 2016/17 as a result of both overachievement of revenues (which has been a persistent trend, given conservative forecasts) and underachievement of expenditures. If growth remains weak, additional discretionary stimulus would be needed in 2017–18. A fiscal package in line with staff’s proposal would still leave fiscal reserves at a comfortable level of around 30 percent of GDP in 2021 and public debt close to zero. Measures could comprise: </P><P MCID="12"> support to vulnerable households, and the elderly, in the lower income deciles, for example through allowances, rental relief and measures to help keep women and elderly workers connected to the workforce (which would also help the long-run position);  </P><P MCID="13"> support for small businesses which has been effective in previous Budgets; and </P><P MCID="14"> bringing forward capital spending to boost housing supply and accelerate urban renewal, to the extent feasible.  </P><P MCID="15"></P></page>

An aging population could lead to structural fiscal deficits within a decade. The labor force will start declining after 2018 and population aging is most marked through to 2045. Rapid population aging will create rising demands for social expenditure and could potentially lower growth and fiscal revenues. Without policy changes, the structural fiscal balance is likely to weaken and deplete the fiscal reserves buffer. These challenging demographics set in against a backdrop of already slowing potential growth in a maturing economy that is close to the knowledge frontier. </P><P MCID="2">30.      These pressures will test the fiscal </P><P MCID="3">framework. The Basic Law stipulates that (i) expenditure </P><P MCID="4">must be kept within the limits of revenue; (ii) fiscal </P><P MCID="5">deficits should be avoided; (iii) the budget should be </P><P MCID="6">kept commensurate with the growth rate of GDP. Early </P><P MCID="7">action is needed before fiscal reserves start depleting </P><P MCID="8">rapidly. In 2013, the authorities established a working </P><P MCID="9">group on long-term fiscal planning (WGLTFP) which </P><P MCID="10">issued a report studying the impact of aging on fiscal outlays. The report found that under current policies reserves would be depleted by 2035-40 with the start of </P><P MCID="11">structural deficits at around 2025-2030. That leaves some time to implement corrective measures, although implementation should start as soon as possible since the demographic transition will be frontloaded. Moreover, early measures will have the largest cushioning effect as they rein in spending at lower levels.  </P><P MCID="12">31.      Efforts should concentrate on tackling the impending structural deficits. Under current policies, structural deficits could set in soon and remain in place beyond the end of the demographic transition. Recurrent spending tied to aging could represent an additional cost of 155 percent of GDP over the next 85 years, or 1.9 percent of GDP in constant equivalent flow per year.  </P><P MCID="13"> On the expenditure side, fundamental expenditure reviews to rein in expenditure growth should be accompanied by a reprioritization towards measures </P><P MCID="14">that boost labor force participation and promote growth.

Long-run fiscal anchor. The aim for fiscal balance and keeping overall government expenditure growth in line with GDP growth over the medium term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate the structural deficit problem. A drawdown of fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy adjusts, but a positive fiscal buffer is desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy, and sustain confidence in fiscal strength, the Hong Kong dollar and monetary stability.  </P><P MCID="2">33.      Measures to boost GDP growth can also help stem the deterioration in the fiscal position. A recommendation of the WGLTFP was to set up a Future Fund, to allow a portion of fiscal reserves to be directed to longer-dated, higher-return investments. Rather than conducting purely financial investments, the Future Fund could also be channeled to local real investments in physical and human capital. Tax policies to encourage labor participation, particularly among women and the elderly and to promote active aging are also key. Sustaining a flexible economy and continuing to have an “open doors” policy and integrate foreign workers are also important. Directing more resources towards the provision of land for construction could have a large impact on growth, although current constraints are often not financial but at the regulatory, procedural and planning stages.  </P><P MCID="3">34.      Monitoring and communication of the long-term fiscal challenge should be stepped up. Producing an independent report every three to five years that updates projections, takes stock of measures undertaken and discusses options, would help demonstrate progress and educate the public on the long run fiscal challenge. It would also illustrate how the authorities balance out long-term concerns against the justified short-term concerns of providing support to the economy and helping those at the bottom of the income distribution. The report could follow the model of Australia’s intergenerational reports or the European Union’s Aging Report.  </P><P MCID="4">Authorities’ Views </P><P MCID="5">35.      The authorities agreed that fiscal policy must balance short-term needs with longer-term structural headwinds from population aging.  </P><P MCID="6"> Near term. The last few budgets had featured considerable supporting measures—in particular, infrastructure investment and transfers to households in particular—that successfully shielded the economy from growing uncertainty and helped to sustain high employment, while inflation remained contained. The fiscal impulse in the current budget was seen as appropriate, but further easing could be considered in the forthcoming 2017/2018 Budget if external conditions remained challenging.  </P><P MCID="7"> Longer term. The authorities were considering policy options to address population aging, while adhering to the principles for fiscal policy set out in the Basic Law. The establishment of the Future Fund would also help generate higher returns on investment. An important part of the policy response to aging would be to maintain economic flexibility and open to foreign workers and to creating incentives to encourage higher labor participation.

The exchange rate regime has been supported by coherent and strong policy frameworks that help the economy adapt to changing global conditions.

The authorities emphasized that the LERS remained the cornerstone of the financial system and the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. Stability played an important role in supporting Hong Kong SAR’s role as a trading and financial center. The credibility of the LERS had stood the test of time through a number of global crises and was supported by a sizable net international investment position, prudent fiscal policy and a flexible economy. The anchor to the U.S. dollar remained most appropriate as it is the most commonly used currency in international trade and for cross border financial transactions, and given the depth, breadth and liquidity of U.S. dollar denominated transactions and low inflation track record. They viewed the exchange rate as being in line with fundamentals. They noted that the current account surplus had narrowed since the GFC not because of a loss in competitiveness arising from the currency board but because of several structural factors including subdued global trade flows and the external rebalancing of mainland China. The authorities concurred with staff’s work which showed that wages and prices were flexible when compared with international peers. Following the introduction of the statutory minimum wage in May 2011 the labor market had still remained broadly stable.

Countercyclical prudential policy. Although credit growth has slowed, there is still a positive credit gap. Risks from high corporate leverage and the housing market have not subsided but may actually increase as U.S. interest rates rise. Thus the authorities’ plan to raise the countercyclical buffer (CCYB) to 1.25 percent from January 2017 and up to the Basel III maximum appears appropriate. The CCYB could be paused or reversed only once the credit gap is eliminated and it becomes apparent that there has been a clearly established change of trend and financial cycle downturn.  </P><P MCID="2">41.

Contingency planning.

With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the three-pronged approach to limiting risks is as important as ever. This involves boosting housing supply to match demand, macroprudential measures to limit stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand. </P><P MCID="9"> Tackling housing supply shortage. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are aimed at addressing the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and infrastructure development (see Box 1). Beyond the ten-year rolling target, continued efforts are needed over a longer horizon to keep pace with household formation and the need for urban renewal. Accelerating plans to increase supply faces a number of obstacles—such as the lack of ready projects, planning restrictions and legal and community objections. Nonetheless, to the extent possible, speeding up processes, making land available, and bringing forward public investment would be a double win—tackling the housing problem and supporting the economy at a time of soft growth. </P><P MCID="10"> Macroprudential measures for housing. Current settings have done their job of limiting financial system exposure to the asset price boom. With house prices rising once more, and valuations stretched, a further orderly house-price adjustment would be helpful. Loan to value (LTV) or debt service to income (DSI) ratio settings should remain fixed.

Housing and Land Supply, and the Development Strategy 1/ </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Housing supply dropped sharply in the 2000s, leading to an acute housing shortage which the authorities are now seeking to address.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Household formation increased by 40 percent over the past twenty years but the supply of housing was cut sharply following the early 2000s-housing market downturn. New public housing was cut from an average of about 50,000 a year in the early 2000s to less than 15,000 in recent years and private housing was cut from 25,000 to 10-15,000. The private domestic vacancy rate almost halved. Land reclamation and site formation also slowed. This led to a growing demand supply imbalance. Projections point to a further expansion of households by 20 percent through to 2044. Compounding this, the housing stock is aging with close to 20 percent of it expected to reach aged 70 or above by 2046. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Tackling the housing shortage is now an important goal of government policy: </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"> The Long-Term Housing Strategy plans to build 460,000 units over the next ten years from 2017/18 to 2026/27 with a public/private split of 60:40. The strategy includes building more public rental units; expanding subsidized home ownership; and steady provision of land supply for private residential properties and tenancy, keeping supply in sync with demand.  </P><P MCID="9"> The longer-term development strategy is being revised in Hong Kong 2030+. It has been issued for public consultation and is expected to be finalized in 2018. It contains a vision to become a livable, high-density city in an environmentally friendly way. </P><P MCID="10">Development of Hong Kong SAR’s land area is challenging with only a quarter of the land supply already developed. Up to 30 percent of the land area is planned or under study for development, other areas face major development, environmental or geographical constraints or are country parks or special areas. Land development typically takes 11–14 years from the preliminary stage to final construction and requires the development of ancillary transport and community services.  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">To push forward a pipeline of land supply the authorities adopted a multi-pronged strategy: </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14"> Near and medium term.

This was a central focus for policy and supply was being increased as quickly as possible without compromising planning principles. The authorities were skeptical that there was much scope to bring forward investment given long time lags for development. The long-term housing strategy aims to gradually avert the supply-demand imbalance in housing, while Hong Kong 2030+ would address the need to step up urban regeneration efforts and result in sustained economic development and better quality living.  </P><P MCID="2"> Macroprudential measures. The authorities viewed the current settings of macroprudential policies as appropriate. Since macroprudential measures were first introduced, at an early stage in 2009, the average LTV on new loans had fallen back from 64 percent immediately before the imposition of tightening measures to around 52 percent in 2016. The measures ensured that banks had sufficient buffers to handle potential shocks matching the worst cycles of the past.  </P><P MCID="3"> Stamp duties. Alongside the HKMA’s imposition of macroprudential measures, the government had used stamp duties to contain speculative and external demand for property. The recent increase in the ad valorem stamp duty rate for residential property transactions had been necessary to manage demand, particularly from investors, in an overheated market.  </P><P MCID="4">SECURING LONG-TERM POTENTIAL </P><P MCID="5">45.      Opportunities and challenges. In addition to the long-term fiscal challenge, the economy will need to adapt to mainland China’s rebalancing and move up the value added chain. This will bring vast opportunities but also requires the same adept flexibility that has helped Hong Kong SAR to successfully navigate change over the course of its history. Reducing inequality (especially from aging and pensioner poverty) and supporting labor participation will also be important for an aging population.  </P><P MCID="6">46.      Building on Hong Kong’s role as a global financial center will be critical for growth. Hong Kong SAR has comparative advantages of geographical location, skilled and well educated workforce, high legal standards and a common language with its main trading partners. Leveraging its strong position as a regional financial hub, opportunities can be tapped from mainland China’s growth, global integration and capital account liberalization. As well as maintaining its position as the leading RMB offshore center, the authorities have a strategy of developing the asset management industry, encouraging corporate treasury centers to domicile in Hong Kong SAR and enabling healthy development of Fintech without compromising consumer and investor protection. There will be opportunities for global companies to conduct business through Hong Kong SAR, both to continue to establish Hong Kong SAR as a financial center for mainland China but also to become more of a global center for finance broadening international activity. The HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office should help facilitate Hong Kong SAR’s role as a financing center for regional infrastructure investment, and mainland China’s “One Belt One Road initiative” will help expand activity. There is also scope to further develop professional services exports. Innovation should continue to be accompanied by strong regulation and supervision over the whole financial system.  </P><P MCID="7">47.      Inequality, aging, and labor force participation.

Inequality in Hong Kong SAR 1/ </P><P MCID="1">Hong Kong’s income inequality as measured by the Gini index appears high in international comparisons, but may have declined recently as the authorities targeted policies at supporting the bottom of the income distribution.  </P><P MCID="2"></P><P MCID="3">Hong Kong SAR’s inequality looks high when comparing Gini indices across economies. The market Gini index measures inequality in market outcomes prior to taxes and transfers, while the net Gini index measures inequality in post-tax and post-transfers outcomes. Hong Kong SAR’s market index and net index of 54 and 44, respectively, in 2011 look relatively high when compared with other economies. </P><P MCID="4">However, comparisons of Gini indices across economies are not straightforward. National statistics offices compute different concepts of the Gini, for example, based on market or net basis, on full income or just wage income, on consumption or income, adjusting for household size or not, and other ad hoc adjustments. When comparing across economies, one needs to use the same concept, which at times may not be possible. Beyond that, comparing Hong Kong’s Gini index to large countries with different urban and economic structures may not be appropriate. For example, Hong Kong SAR’s market Gini index seems in line with that of other cities with a sizable financial sector.  </P><P MCID="5">Inequality has declined recently as the authorities implemented policies targeted at the bottom of the income distribution. The net Gini index has come down from above 50 in 2002–03 to 44 in 2011, the last year for which data are available. 2/ It has likely declined further as income has grown more rapidly at the bottom of the income distribution compared to the top since 2010. The authorities have implemented targeted policies like the introduction of a statutory minimum wage in 2011 and subsequent increases, the implementation of the Low-Income Working Family and Old-Age Living Allowances, transport subsidy, and expanding the supply of public rental housing. They also established a Commission on Poverty that devised Hong Kong SAR’s first official poverty line. These policies and increased scrutiny explain why Hong Kong SAR has a larger degree of redistribution compared to the Asia region.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">–––––––––––––––––– </P><P MCID="8">1/ Prepared by Rui Mano. </P><P MCID="9">2/ New data should be available in 2017 using the results of the 2016 census. </P><P MCID="10">Regional Comparison: Income Inequality Level </P><P MCID="11">(Net Gini Index; in Gini points; year of 2011; average across the region) </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14">  </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16"></P></page>

Inequality in Hong Kong SAR (concluded) </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Going forward, structural changes in the economy may not lead necessarily to higher inequality because of offsetting shifts in the labor force… </P><P MCID="3">The pattern of wage growth across industries varies widely: while some have seen high growth in pay per worker, others have not. The latter are mostly tied to the “old” economy and thus have underperformed due to the ongoing structural rebalance. At face value this could be driving income inequality, given that industries that have had low pay growth still account for more than half of the labor force in the private sector. However, at the same time, the labor force has shifted away from some these industries, likely a reflection of the flexible labor market. These patterns are expected to continue as the economy transforms and moves up the value chain. Maintaining flexibility in the labor market is therefore crucial. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">…but a low growth environment has been accompanied by an increase in inequality in the past. Hong Kong SAR’s recent economic history can be divided into three main periods. From the 1960s to early 1990s, income per capita grew rapidly while inequality, measured by the net Gini index, remained stable. Between the early nineties and early 2000s, Hong Kong SAR’s per capita income growth declined and inequality increased rapidly. Since the early 2000s, income growth has picked markedly up and inequality has declined significantly. Income growth is slowing once more, which raises the concern that inequality may also rise. </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Allowance Scheme provides supplementary income to individuals and families with income and assets under a certain threshold and is targeted to encourage those on low incomes to stay in or reconnect to the workforce. The statutory minimum wage has helped boost labor supply without damaging wage flexibility and a further moderate increase could be accommodated. Working hours and overtime pay policy could also help encourage participation by those at the lower end of the income and skills distribution, but would need to take into account other pressures on the labor market. Policies that encourage active aging can also improve the fiscal position and help reduce health spending relative to a counterfactual. </P><P MCID="9">  </P><P MCID="10">-4-202468101214Sectors with low growth in pay per worker 2/Sectors with high growth in pay per worker 3/Growth in real pay per workerChange in labor force share 1/Labor Force is Shifting towards Jobs with Higher Real PayGrowth (Percentage points)Sources: HKSAR Census and Statistics Department; and IMF staff estimates.1/ Labor force excluding civil servants. 2/ Social and personal services, manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation, and professional services. 3/  Retail, Accomodation and food, Information and communications, Financial and insurance andReal estate.Overall growthin pay per worker between 2008-2015 = 7.4%</P><P MCID="11">010203040506005010015020025030035019601965197019751980198519901995200020052010GDP per capita (th.

Growth and outlook. Growth has slowed since 2015 and the external outlook is more challenging with the U.S. rate cycle is edging up, global trade growth tepid and mainland China rebalancing. With soft external conditions, the growth recovery is likely to be gradual with the output gap closing slowly. Over the medium-term population aging pressures may affect potential growth and weaken the structural fiscal position. On the upside, the economy is highly flexible and large potential can be tapped from the further development of Hong Kong SAR as a global financial center. Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), provides a credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally integrated financial services industry. </P><P MCID="2">49.      There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland China’s growth prospects spill over to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a large globally-integrated financial sector and a currency board arrangement, the economy is exposed to U.S. developments and global market volatility. The property market is also a source of downside risk. With strong buffers in place these risks are manageable and should not adversely affect the economy provided that, as anticipated, interest rates rise at a moderate pace and mainland China’s transition to a more sustainable growth path remains orderly.  </P><P MCID="3">50.      Fiscal policy. As the main demand management lever, fiscal policy needs to strike a balance between supporting aggregate demand and preserving a buffer for the longer-run challenge posed by aging. In the near term with a significant and persistent output gap, a difficult external environment, and weak automatic stabilizers, there is a case for further fiscal impetus which can be removed as the economy recovers. The planned impulse in the 2016–17 Budget is appropriate but if it undershoots and growth remains weak, additional stimulus will be needed in fiscal year 2017–18. Aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward would help ensure that cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend. </P><P MCID="4">51.      Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the 2014 Report on Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing expenditures to measures that boost labor participation and support growth, raising revenues and managing assets—would help alleviate the fiscal impact of aging. Measures to broaden the tax base may also be needed. The aim for balance and keeping overall government expenditure growth in line with GDP growth over the medium term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate the structural deficit problem. A drawdown of the fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy adjusts, but a positive fiscal buffer is desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy, and sustain confidence.  </P><P MCID="5">52.      Property market measures. With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the three-pronged approach to limiting risks—boosting housing supply, macroprudential measures to limit stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand—is well placed. Current macroprudential settings have done their job of limiting financial system exposure </P><P MCID="6"></P></page>

As the distorting costs of duties become more significant the higher they are, they should be rolled back once the trend has shifted toward reduced price and speculative pressures.  </P><P MCID="1">53.      Housing supply. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are aimed at addressing the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and infrastructure development. Accelerating plans to increase supply, speeding up processes, making land available, bringing forward public investment would be a double win—tackling the housing problem and supporting the economy at a time of soft growth. </P><P MCID="2">54.      Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help limit the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities. The authorities have a track record as a global standard setter in regulation and supervision and in addressing data gaps. Substantial progress has been made on implementing the 2014 FSAP recommendations. An independent insurance authority has been established, strengthened standards for securities listing have been implemented, and legislation has been put in place for a resolution framework for financial institutions which is designed to implement the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes. There is substantial coordination among government and regulators domestically, there are close links with mainland regulators and the authorities are active in international fora, including in supervisory colleges for cross-border banking and insurance groups, on global systemically important financial institutions, and in crisis management groups. Areas for continued attention include further enhancing stress testing and reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events.  </P><P MCID="3">55.      Exchange rate regime and external position. The LERS remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR backed by the credibility built up over three decades and tested through crises. The LERS is underpinned by the flexible economy, ample reserves buffers and strong financial regulation and supervision. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to cyclical conditions and structural change. The external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. </P><P MCID="4">56.      Contingency planning. As a trading hub and global financial center, the economy is inevitably exposed to global external shocks. In the event of an adverse shock, a comprehensive and coordinated policy approach similar to the 2008/9 response would be appropriate: including large fiscal stimulus, loosening of macroprudential policies, expanded credit guarantees, emergency liquidity provision and close international supervisory coordination. The recently introduced crisis resolution framework is strengthening the ability to respond to strains in the banking, corporate and household sectors. </P><P MCID="5">57.

The FIRO will come into operation on a date to be appointed by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, which is expected to be subsequent to the coming into force of certain key regulations, primarily those relating to the protection of certain financial arrangements in resolution, to be made as subsidiary legislation under the FIRO.  </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="11"> The cross-sector regime applies to all banks (authorized institutions (“AIs”), certain securities firms, insurers and financial market infrastructures, holding companies and non-regulated operating entities of within scope financial institutions (“FIs”), and extends to branches of foreign FIs.  The Monetary Authority (“MA”), the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and the Insurance Authority are established as resolution authorities under the FIRO with responsibility for the planning for and execution of resolution in respect of those within scope FIs operating under their respective purviews (e.g., the MA is the resolution authority for AIs).  A lead resolution authority may be designated by the Financial Secretary to coordinate and lead resolution planning, and if necessary execution, for a cross-sectoral group, which contains more than one within scope FI from more than one sector (e.g., certain global systemically important bank operations in Hong Kong). </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="12"> Further work is currently underway to bring the FIRO into force and to make the regime provided for under it, including the transfer and bail-in stabilization options, operational from a resolution policy perspective. At the HKMA, a significant part of this work is to establish a permanent resolution function within the HKMA with dedicated resources and governance. On resolution policy, the work includes the development of key regulations to be made under FIRO such as loss absorbing capacity requirement regulations for within scope FIs (including AIs), the establishment of resolution planning information requirements for AIs (expected to be issued within second half of 2016), and ongoing engagement in international resolution policy development.   </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="13">Recovery planning for banks [On Track] </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="14"> The supervisory recovery planning framework for AIs is established in the HKMA’s Supervisory Policy Manual module on Recovery Planning (RE-1), which was issued in June 2014.

In this annual exercise, IA collects from insurers data about their financial assets by categories and their shadow banking activities.

For example, the SFC worked closely with different mainland authorities to launch the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in November 2014 and the mutual recognition of funds in July 2015, and to prepare for the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect which was announced in August 2016.   </P><P Lang="en-GB" MCID="19"> The Insurance Authority (“IA”) has been maintaining close dialogue with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CIRC”) on supervisory matters relating to mainland insurers’ subsidiaries and branches operating in Hong Kong SAR, as well as mainland shareholders and business partners (e.g., reinsurers) of Hong Kong SAR insurers. IA has entered into two MOUs with CIRC on cooperation of insurance supervision and anti-insurance fraud. There are regular meetings between IA and CIRC to enhance understanding of the insurance market of the other side and to enhance regulatory cooperation on cross-border insurance business activities. </P><P MCID="20"></P><P MCID="21">  </P></page>

The SFC then worked with the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on an MOU to establish cooperation arrangements, as it was a pre-condition for the recognition of a non-EU CCP.   The MOU was signed and took effect on 19 December 2014. These steps culminated in the ESMA’s recognising the four CCPs in Hong Kong SAR (HKSCC, HKFE, OTC Clear and SEOCH) as third country CCPs to offer services and activities to entities established in the EU in accordance with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation on 29 April 2015.  The recognition was granted without conditions.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA explicitly committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced price (set at HK$7.75/US$), which is referred to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously, the HKMA had only committed to buy Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced rate (the weak-side convertibility undertaking introduced in October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong dollar at any price. Along with this two-way convertibility undertaking, the HKMA also introduced a symmetric trading band of 0.6 percent around a central parity of HK$7.8/US$. There are no restrictions on current or capital account transactions in Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible. The People’s Republic of China accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement on December 1, 1996. The exchange regime is free of restrictions and multiple currency practices. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Resident Representative </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing Resident Representative’s office was opened on September 23, 2000.
