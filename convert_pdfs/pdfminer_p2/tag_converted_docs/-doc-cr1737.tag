A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and the launch of structural reforms has helped the economy weather slow global growth, the commodity down-cycle, and several episodes of financial turbulence affecting emerging market economies. While growth has slowed slightly, it has remained robust. Inflation has eased and the external position has improved. A gradual fiscal consolidation has begun. There has been major progress on the financial stability framework, and gaps related to the crisis management framework are being addressed. Structural reforms that began in 2015 have improved the business environment. Positive sentiment has been reflected in supportive capital inflows in 2016, which buoyed financial markets before undergoing some corrections starting in October.  </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15">Private consumption remains the main driver of growth, but higher inclusive growth will require deeper structural reforms. Consumption growth has been underpinned by an expanding middle class, lower fuel prices, and falling inflation. Investment has remained subdued, reflecting spillovers from lower commodity prices, some excess capacity in mining and manufacturing, and structural impediments, while external demand has been weak. In staff’s views, consumption-led growth can be sustained over the medium term, but meeting the authorities’ ambitious targets for inclusive growth will require deepening structural reforms. </P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17">The near-term outlook remains favorable. Growth in 2016 is projected at 5 percent on account of robust private consumption. In 2017, growth is expected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent, led by a gradual pickup in private investment in response to stronger commodity prices, low interest </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="18">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Inflation is expected to rise from 3.2 percent at end-2016 to around 4.5 percent at end-2017 largely due to lower electricity subsidies and some recovery in commodity prices. The current account deficit would remain at around 2 percent of GDP next year, with the expected pickup in fixed investment and imports offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on exports. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Executive Board Assessment2 </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Executive Directors commended the authorities for their successful management of macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms, which have preserved stability amidst challenging shifts in the external environment. Directors noted that, while the economy is subject to downside risks, the outlook is positive and Indonesia is better placed today to weather an uncertain external environment than in previous years. Against that background, they encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening the medium-term policy framework through fiscal and structural reforms to support inclusive growth and preserve macro stability.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy, which aims to broaden the revenue base and expand priority expenditures, while enhancing their efficiency within the statutory fiscal deficit limit. They supported the government’s short-term fiscal stance, including the start of a gradual fiscal consolidation in August 2016 focused on rebuilding fiscal buffers. Directors saw merit in tax reform measures to generate the bulk of additional revenues needed to increase spending on infrastructure, health and education, which is low compared to peer emerging market economies. They supported the authorities’ plans to pursue growth-friendly tax reforms this year, including administration reforms that would lower taxpayers’ compliance costs.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Directors considered that the current monetary policy stance is broadly appropriate and encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to the resurgence of inflationary pressures, and to stand ready to adjust the policy stance, as needed. They welcomed reforms to improve the transmission of monetary policy and financial market deepening, which will help manage external financial volatility. Directors concurred that the external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals, and that continued exchange rate flexibility and  </P><P MCID="9">market-determined bond yields would be critical to help absorb external pressures.  </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">Directors considered that the banking sector is broadly healthy and noted the progress made by Bank Indonesia and the financial sector supervisor, OJK, in assessing financial and corporate sector risks. They encouraged continued close monitoring of pockets of vulnerability, particularly from somewhat higher NPLs and from corporate external debt exposure. Directors welcomed the adoption of the Financial System Crisis Prevention and Mitigation (FSCPM) Law, which has strengthened the financial stability framework. They encouraged the authorities to make the law fully operational as early as possible with the issuance of relevant regulations and to ensure the continued full implementation of corporate hedging regulations.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="12">2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms has helped the economy weather the commodity down-cycle and several episodes of emerging market (EM) financial turbulence. Securing and boosting growth in a more uncertain external environment requires maintaining policy buffers, while upgrading the medium-term framework through fiscal and structural reforms.  </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">Near-term outlook: Growth in 2017 is projected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent, supported by robust private consumption. Inflation is expected to remain within the official target band, albeit slightly higher in 2017 due to lower electricity subsidies. The current account deficit would remain contained. The risks to the outlook have risen and are mainly external. External risks include uncertainties about the policies of the incoming United States administration, tighter global financial conditions, spillovers from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices, which could intensify macro-financial vulnerabilities related to banks and corporates. Domestic risks include tax revenue shortfalls or higher domestic interest rates due to tighter global financial conditions, which could curb fiscal space.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Main policy recommendations: Strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework through tax policy and administration reforms, and continue to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. Monetary policy should stand ready to deal with changes in a more volatile external environment, while maintaining exchange rate and bond yield flexibility. It is important to fully implement the enhanced financial stability framework by issuing the regulations of the Financial System Crisis Prevention and Mitigation (FSCPM) Law, strengthen inter-agency coordination to respond to shocks, and address macro-financial vulnerabilities from the bank and corporate sectors. Deeper structural reforms are needed to improve the business environment further and support private investment. Finally, the policy strategy should continue to include actions to boost the economy’s resilience, to allow it to prosper even if the external environment becomes choppier. </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">December 27, 2016 </P></page>

A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and the launch of structural reforms has helped the economy weather the commodity down-cycle, slow global growth, and several episodes of financial turbulence affecting EMs. While growth has slowed slightly, it has remained robust. Inflation has eased and the external position has improved. A gradual fiscal consolidation has begun. There has been major progress on the financial stability framework, and gaps related to the crisis management framework are being addressed. Structural reforms that began in 2015 so far have improved the business environment. Positive sentiment has been reflected in supportive capital inflows in 2016, which buoyed financial markets before undergoing some corrections starting in October. Since the United States (U.S.) elections and the December decision by the FED to raise interest rates, markets have accelerated the correction. </P><P MCID="3">2.      Private consumption remains the main driver of growth, but higher inclusive growth will require deeper structural reforms. Consumption growth has been underpinned by an expanding middle class, lower fuel prices, and falling inflation. Investment has remained subdued, reflecting spillovers from lower commodity prices, some excess capacity in mining and manufacturing, and structural impediments, while external demand has been weak. In staff’s views, consumption-led growth can be sustained over the medium term, but meeting the authorities’ ambitious targets for inclusive growth will require deepening structural reforms.  </P><P MCID="4">3.      Discussions focused on policies to strengthen the medium-term policy framework to support inclusive growth, while preserving macro stability in an uncertain and volatile external environment. The challenge is to continue, and in some cases deepen, ongoing structural reforms that will boost productivity and growth, while maintaining and improving policy buffers to boost resilience in an increasingly uncertain and volatile external environment. Policy priorities include: (i) strengthening the medium-term fiscal framework with a growth-friendly revenue strategy and continuing to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending; (ii) standing ready to adjust monetary policy to deal with changes in the external environment, while maintaining exchange rate and bond yield flexibility; (iii) implementing the enhanced financial stability framework, improving inter-agency coordination to respond to shocks, and sustaining vigilance on pockets of macro-financial vulnerabilities from the bank and corporate sectors; and (iv) deepening structural reforms to improve the business environment and support private investment.  </P><P MCID="5">4.      Past Fund advice and the authorities’ policies have been broadly aligned. In 2016, monetary policy easing was appropriately calibrated and there was progress with monetary operations reform. The authorities continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy. The FSCPM Law passed in March was a milestone for the financial stability architecture. On the fiscal front, however, the authorities decided to launch a tax amnesty to expand the revenue base and strengthen compliance instead of raising excises. </P><P MCID="6"></P></page>

In 2016, growth remained strong, inflation dropped significantly, and the current account deficit was contained. </P><P MCID="6"> Growth remained robust at 5.0 percent in 2016:Q3 due to resilient private consumption, despite some modest fiscal consolidation and still weak private investment and external demand. Credit growth slowed to the lowest over the past few years on weak corporate demand, before slightly picking up recently.  </P><P MCID="7"> Headline inflation dropped to the bottom of the official target band (3−5 percent)—the lowest since end-2009—owing to stable food prices, lower administered prices, and a small negative output gap (½ percent of GDP), with core inflation also moderating.  </P><P MCID="8"> The current account (CA) deficit remained contained at 2.1 percent of GDP in Q1Q3:2016, due mainly to lower imports that more than offset lower exports. Official reserve assets rose to US$111.5 billion at end-November (around 8 months of prospective imports), amid supportive portfolio inflows in the first three quarters of 2016. </P><P MCID="9">6.      The near-term outlook remains favorable. Growth in 2016 is projected at 5 percent on account of robust private consumption. In 2017, growth is expected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent, led by a gradual pickup in private investment in response to stronger commodity prices, low interest rates, and a recovery in external demand on the back of a pickup in global growth and trade. Inflation is expected to rise from 3.2 percent at end-2016 to around 4.5 percent at end-2017 largely due to lower electricity subsidies and some recovery in commodity prices. The CA deficit would remain at around 2 percent of GDP next year, with the expected pickup in fixed investment and imports offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on exports. </P><P MCID="10">7.      Overall macro-financial risks appear more manageable, but pockets of risks remain. Macro-financial pressures have moderated slightly, aided by some recovery in commodity prices, portfolio inflows during much of 2016, and private external debt deleveraging. Indonesian financial markets experienced strong rallies until Q3:2016. The correction that began in October intensified after the U.S. election in November and the FED’s decision to raise interest rates in December—in the period of November 8-December 16, equities fell by 4 percent, benchmark 10year bond yields rose 70 bps, and the rupiah weakened 2.3 percent, with portfolio outflows. During this episode, financial market volatility was higher than following Brexit, but less than during the 2013 taper tantrum. Corporates’ external borrowing has started to decline, after a rapid rise in previous years, and credit growth remains tepid. Corporate debt-at-risk with an interest coverage ratio less than 1 picked up somewhat this year. Banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs) have also risen, albeit from a low level, while liquidity remains tight in some smaller banks, and deposit growth slowed. Fiscal financing remains reliant on nonresident investment in local currency (LCY) government bonds and </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Indonesia’s external position in 2016 is assessed to remain broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Box 1, Appendix II). Staff estimates the current account gap to be between -0.8 and 1.2 percent of GDP, with the REER gap in the range of -6 percent to 4 percent. The main conclusion from the external and public DSA are broadly unchanged from the last Article IV (Appendix III). At 35.8 percent of GDP (about half of which is public) at end-September 2016, external debt remains at a moderate level. External financing has been sustainable, but remains sensitive to domestic and external volatility. At about 130 percent of IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (projected for end-2016), reserves are expected to be sufficient to buffer most shocks. </P><P MCID="9">9.      Over the medium-term, the macroeconomic outlook is expected to improve. Growth is projected to increase to 5½ percent by 2020, supported by a gradual recovery in fixed investment and ongoing structural reforms, with the output gap closing by 2018. International reserves are projected to gradually increase, with the reserve adequacy metric remaining broadly stable. </P><P MCID="10">10.      Under an illustrative enhanced reform scenario prepared by staff that involves a more growth-friendly fiscal policy, growth would rise to 6 percent by 2021, mainly on account of higher infrastructure and social spending, as well as to some productivity growth from capital accumulation and reforms. </P><P MCID="11">11.      Downside risks to the outlook have risen recently and are largely external. (Appendix I: Risk Assessment Matrix) The government and corporate sector’s reliance on external financing makes Indonesia susceptible to global shocks and funding reversals. External risks include uncertainties around the policies of the incoming U.S. administration, tighter and more volatile global conditions, spillovers from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices.

Domestic risks include a smaller fiscal buffer, reflecting tax revenue shortfalls or higher domestic interest rates due to tighter global financial conditions, which could curb fiscal space to support growth. Domestic political tensions associated with regional elections could also increase. A confluence of external and domestic factors could intensify pockets of macro-financial vulnerabilities related to the banking and corporate sectors. Upside risks include stronger global growth and higher commodity prices, aided by an expected fiscal stimulus in the United States.  </P><P MCID="1">12.      In the event of severe external pressures, tighter aggregate demand management and continued exchange rate flexibility could help contain risks. International reserves should be used primarily to prevent disorderly market conditions, provided that reserves remain adequate (Appendix I: Risk Assessment Matrix). If international financial markets were to be closed to EMs for a protracted period of time, targeted measures to alleviate funding pressures by banks and corporates would help preserve financial stability. Contingent financing totaling about US$83 billion is currently available, inclusive of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization and bilateral swap arrangements. </P><P MCID="2">Authorities’ Views  </P><P MCID="3">13.      The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the macroeconomic outlook. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, while enhancing the medium-term framework to raise growth potential. Growth is projected to strengthen in 2017, underpinned by a recovery in private investment, with exports also expected to benefit from the recent strong rebound in coal and palm oil prices; inflation and related expectations remain at multiyear lows; and the CA deficit is expected to remain well contained, while reserve buffers have risen considerably. In their views, these developments, coupled with a flexible policy framework, contingency plans, and a range of available contingent financing place Indonesia in a strong position to manage the downside risks emanating primarily from outside the country.  </P><P MCID="4">POLICY DISCUSSIO</P><P MCID="5">NS</P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">A.   Fiscal Policy and Reforms—Growth-Enhancing Revenue and Expenditure Strategy </P><P MCID="8">14.      The government’s fiscal strategy centers on broadening the revenue base and expanding priority expenditures, while making them more efficient within the statutory fiscal deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP. The government aims to mobilize tax revenue by strengthening tax collection efforts, simplifying layers of exemptions, and broadening the tax base. The authorities also intend to continue reallocating unproductive spending and improving the efficiency of spending, including on infrastructure, social programs, and transfers to local governments.

Aided by these efforts and the planned tax reform, the government aims to gradually lower the fiscal deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP over the medium term, to rebuild buffers and strengthen the fiscal sector’s resilience to outside shocks.  </P><P MCID="1">15.      In August 2016, the authorities began a gradual fiscal consolidation while protecting the government’s priorities. Weak revenues had pushed the fiscal deficit to 1.8 percent of annual GDP in 2016:H1, requiring lower spending in H2 to stay within the deficit rule of 3 percent of GDP. In addition to weak commodity-related revenues, nonoil revenues—particularly Value Added Tax (VAT) and excise taxes—continue to underperform, exacerbating Indonesia’s structurally low tax revenues. </P><P MCID="2">Against this backdrop, the Cabinet approved a revised financial plan in August 2016, with more realistic revenue projections and lower spending, that staff project will lead to a fiscal deficit of about 2.7 percent of GDP. Collections from the amnesty program2 surprised on the upside (Rp 99.2 trillion or 0.8 percent of GDP as of November 30), coming mainly from previously undeclared domestic assets; for 2016 as a whole, tax amnesty collections are projected to reach 0.9 percent of GDP. Building on the success of the amnesty, the government intends to </P><P MCID="3">expand the tax base and strengthen relations and trust between the private sector and the tax administration. </P><P MCID="4">16.      The 2017 budget targets higher revenue, more efficient spending in priority areas, and a lower fiscal deficit. The 2017 budget increases nominal tax collections by around 13 percent, on stronger collection efforts and expanded tax base. The authorities plan to upgrade the main tax laws in 2017, including VAT and income tax laws, while using the information gathered from the tax amnesty combined with external databases to guide audits. The budget continues to relocate operational spending to priority areas, including infrastructure, education, and health, reduces and better targets electricity subsidies for the poor, and increases transfers to local governments for infrastructure. The fiscal deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP will help rebuild fiscal buffers. </P><P MCID="5">Staff Position </P><P MCID="6">17.      The government’s fiscal strategy is well-placed.

While Indonesia has some fiscal space to expand spending, the decision to rebuild fiscal buffers in 2017 by targeting a lower fiscal deficit is appropriate. A range of indicators point to the availability of fiscal space, even within the existing fiscal rule, including relatively small financing needs and deficit levels, low inflation and credit growth, and a sustainable external position. However, in the current context, the authorities’ plan to rebuild fiscal buffers by lowering the fiscal deficit target in 2017 and rationalizing spending to achieve a sustained lower primary deficit is appropriate. These policies will support the economy’s resilience to shocks, which is needed if Indonesia is to prosper in a more volatile external environment. Meeting the authorities’ revenue targets for 2017 will be challenging. If revenue shortfalls persist, additional revenue actions will be needed to maintain the planned level of spending and meet the deficit target.  </P><P MCID="2">19.      There is room to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework to promote productivity gains and growth. Public investment in infrastructure and expansion of social spending, especially health and education, can catalyze other key drivers for medium-term growth, supplemented by improving the efficiency of public expenditure. To achieve these, fiscal buffers need to be strengthened, within the fiscal rule, buttressed by additional revenue measures from tax policy and administration reforms. Higher domestic revenue mobilization will gradually reduce reliance on external financing. Finally, moving to more frequent adjustments of retail fuel prices through a transparent fuel pricing mechanism would also protect the budget from upward changes in international oil prices.  </P><P MCID="3">20.      In an illustrative reform scenario prepared by staff, where both revenue and expenditure would increase by around 3 percentage points of GDP by 2021, potential growth would increase to 6 percent by 2021.

There is scope to mobilize non-oil revenues through growth-friendly tax policy and administration reforms. Since 2012, total general government revenue has fallen by 2.5 percentage points of GDP, mainly due to lower production and prices of petroleum products, and, more recently, import contraction also affecting VAT receipts. At the same time, non-oil revenue in percent of GDP remains weak at around its 2004 level.

Tax administration reforms are an important element of a growth-friendly fiscal policy.

The current focus on strengthening the tax administration through incremental reforms, rather than undergoing a potentially disruptive reform of establishing a Semi-Autonomous Revenue Authority (SARA), is well-placed.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and described their actions to support growth. A sound financial plan for 2016 approved in August 2016 enabled more realistic revenue projections and a streamlined expenditure envelope, aimed at strengthening fiscal buffers. By streamlining less-productive spending, they improved expenditure composition with a focus on growth-enhancing areas, including critical infrastructure projects and better targeted energy subsidies. These efforts, combined with potential for further revenue-raising reforms in the near to medium term, can support fiscal consolidation while protecting spending that is catalytic for growth.  </P><P MCID="5">27.

They noted that tobacco excises were again increased in the 2017 budget. The authorities indicated that a tax reform group will be formed to develop a comprehensive plan to upgrade the main tax laws in 2017.

Important progress has been made in monetary operation reforms (Box 2).

Financial and Corporate Sector Issues—Strengthening the Financial Stability Framework7 </P><P MCID="2">34.      Financial soundness indicators suggest that the banking sector is broadly healthy, albeit with areas of vulnerabilities. The high level of banks’ capital and profitability has helped weather slowing economic growth. On average, the banking system is well capitalized and profitable, with a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 23.3 percent and returns on assets (ROA) of 2.4 percent (as of August 2016). However, soundness varies across different types of banks. Some smaller banks are more vulnerable to a liquidity shock, due to their higher reliance on short-term time deposits and limited access to the money market. The financial system as a whole remains liquid. Some sources of vulnerabilities include the rise in NPLs, special mention loans (SMLs), and restructured loans, although there are early signs that these are stabilizing.8 Higher NPLs are related mainly to manufacturing and trade, while NPLs in mining further increased.  </P><P MCID="3">35.      Risks from the corporate sector have somewhat moderated, but they remain elevated (Box 3). Corporate vulnerabilities stem from a relatively high level of foreign currency denominated (FX) debt exposures, elevated distressed debt, and lower cash buffers. FX risk of corporate debt has mitigated somewhat due to the slight decline in external borrowing and deleveraging, following weak investment appetite and business consolidation, as well as by the full implementation of BI hedging regulations.9 Profitability has improved slightly, supported by cost-cutting and postponement of investment projects. Nonetheless, corporate performance has varied across sectors, with commodity related sectors slightly recovering and manufacturing remaining weak.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="4">7 The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Report will be discussed separately at the Board later in 2017. </P><P MCID="5">8 NPLs rose to 3.1 percent of total loans in September 2016 (end-2015: 2.4 percent), SMLs at 5.4 percent (end-2015: 4.9 percent); and the share of restructured loans in total loans more than doubled to 5.1 percent between April 2015 and September 2016.  </P><P MCID="6">9 The hedging regulations consist of (i) the minimum hedging ratio, which requires 25 percent of the net foreign currency liabilities with a maturity period up to three months, and those that mature between three and six months; (ii) the minimum liquidity ratio, requiring 70 percent of short-term foreign currency assets and short-term foreign currency liabilities; and (iii) a credit rating of no less than BB or equivalent issued by an authorized rating agency.  </P></page>

The economy is at a late stage of the credit cycle. Credit growth declined to 6.3 percent in October 2016 from 10 percent at end-2015, but appears to have bottomed out recently. FX loans have declined. Credit growth to corporates varies by sector, with weakness in mining and manufacturing, and robust growth in construction. Sluggish credit growth has been mainly driven by weak corporate credit demand, reflecting low investment. At the same time, some institutions, particularly medium-sized banks, have tightened their lending standards given higher NPLs, but conversely, credit expansion in large state-owned banks remains relatively robust. Some firms have also been shifting financing sources from banks to capital markets, which can partially explain lower lending from banks. Consumer loan growth has similarly slowed down in recent years.  </P><P MCID="2">37.      The authorities have further unwound part of an earlier tightening of macroprudential policies undertaken in 2012−13.10 The unwinding includes easing loan-to-value (LTV) limits on mortgage loans and down payments on auto loans, and raising the floor of banks’ loan-to-funding ratios that would incur reserve requirements.11 BI has introduced a counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCB) in January 2016, currently set at zero. </P><P MCID="3">38.

The authorities are closely monitoring the process of NPL restructuring to ensure financial stability. The authorities also noted ongoing efforts to further improve monitoring of the corporate sector, where they see that risks have abated to some extent and remain manageable, aided by BI’s FX hedging regulations.

Structural Reforms—Boosting Private Investment </P><P MCID="5">44.      The authorities place high importance on revamping the business climate and have achieved some early successes. Following the landmark 2015 fuel subsidy reform, the authorities have been implementing reforms aimed at improving the business environment and strengthening the economy’s productivity and competitiveness. The government announced 14 economic policy packages since September 2015, including some that streamline regulations and support private sector investment. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regime was also partially liberalized, and clarity has increased on the setting of the minimum wage.13 These actions contributed to Indonesia’s notable improvement in World Bank’s Doing Business ranking in 2016 (15 positions to the 91st position).  </P><P MCID="6">45.

The Indonesian economy continues to perform well, supported by robust growth and macroeconomic stability. Over the past few years, the economy has weathered well a major commodity down-cycle and several episodes of financial turbulence affecting EMs, aided by a prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive, with economic growth rising modestly, inflation within the official target band, and the current account deficit manageable. </P><P MCID="6">49.      Downside risks to the outlook have risen recently and are largely external. Indonesia’s reliance on external financing leaves it susceptible to global shocks and funding reversals. External risks include uncertainties around the policies of the incoming U.S. administration, tighter and more volatile global conditions, spillovers from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices. Domestic risk arises primarily from tax revenue shortfalls and higher interest rates, which could curb fiscal space to support growth.  </P><P MCID="7">50.      The authorities have strengthened the short-term fiscal framework. The revised financial plan approved by Cabinet for 2016 includes prudent revenue projections and spending commitments.

There is room to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework, including through fiscal reforms that generate productivity gains and improved infrastructure. Low tax collections continue to limit fiscal space. The authorities’ plan to upgrade the main tax laws in 2017 is well placed. There is also room to deepen tax administration reforms to strengthen compliance and reduce compliance costs. Ongoing actions to enhance the quality and efficiency of public spending should continue. The authorities should continue to move towards automaticity of energy prices via a transparent fuel pricing mechanism. The domestic investor base of the government bond market needs to be strengthened, which combined with higher domestic revenue mobilization, will gradually reduce reliance on external financing over the medium term. </P><P MCID="1">52.      Tax reform can generate the bulk of additional needed tax revenue. Excise tax rates on vehicle and tobacco could be increased in the near term, together with a new environmental (fuel) tax, while simplifying the structure of tobacco excises over the medium term. VAT provides the greatest revenue potential and the authorities could gradually raise the VAT rate, coupled with removing VAT exemptions, while simplifying administration. PIT base could be broadened by a lower threshold for the top rate, while capitalizing on asset declarations under the amnesty.  </P><P MCID="2">53.      Business-friendly tax administration reforms would lower taxpayers’ compliance costs. The business environment can be strengthened by removing ambiguities and inconsistencies in the tax laws, and simplifying VAT filing and refund requirements.

The current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Policy rates were lowered in 2016, in an environment of falling inflation and reduced external pressures on the rupiah. With inflation remaining within the target band and the external environment more uncertain, the policy rate since has been placed on hold. Exchange rate flexibility has allowed the economy to adjust to intermittent shocks, including higher volatility in capital flows. Continuing with this approach will be critical to allow the economy to adjust to shocks, including by standing ready to adjust the monetary policy stance in the event of severe external pressures and allowing the exchange rate and bond yields to move flexibly. Indonesia’s external position in 2016 is assessed to continue to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. </P><P MCID="4">55.      The reform of monetary operations should continue.

In addition, a large portion of the external debt of nonfinancial corporates is with parent or related loans. Corporate performance varies across sectors, with manufacturing particularly weak.

In response to expectations for higher interest rates following the U.S. elections and the increase in the U.S. policy rate in December, corporates could face higher funding costs together with exchange rate depreciation and less supportive capital flows.

The banking system overall remains sound, with some pockets of vulnerabilities. Some smaller banks are more vulnerable to liquidity shock due to their higher reliance on short-term time deposits. Other sources of vulnerabilities are increased NPLs, special mention loans (SMLs), and restructured loans, although there are early signs that they are stabilizing. The authorities should continue to closely monitor banks’ soundness and liquidity conditions, including loan classification and provisioning, while enhancing inter-agency coordination.

The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable, but nonresident holdings of rupiah denominated government bonds, with a share of 37 percent at end-November 2016, could be affected by global volatility. Private external debt growth is expected to slow on the implementation of BI’s FX hedging regulations, and expected tightening of global financial conditions. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Current account. Drawing on the IMF’s model-based External Balance Assessment (EBA) regression exercise, staff assess the cyclically-adjusted current gap to be -0.8 percent to 1.2 percent of GDP relative to the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies for 2016. Much of this gap could be accounted for by low public health spending in Indonesia and fiscal policy gaps in other countries.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Real exchange rate. Compared to the 2015 average, the REER appreciated by 3.1 percent in the first ten months of 2016. EBA index and level REER results suggest the REER gap to be about -3.4 percent to 3.2 percent, respectively, in line with staff’s REER gap assessment in the range of -6 percent to 4 percent based on the CA assessment.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Capital and financial accounts. Indonesia’s gross external financing requirement is expected to be about 9.2 percent of GDP in 2016, with amortization at about 6 percent of GDP. Net FDI and new borrowing are projected at 1.5 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP, respectively. Net and gross financial flows have been steady since the global financial crisis despite some short episodes of volatility. The narrower current account deficit and strengthened policy framework including exchange rate flexibility since mid-2013 have also helped reduce capital flow volatility. For 2016, financial flows have been supported by attractive bond yields and assets repatriation related to the tax amnesty but could become weaker or reverse in the event of large domestic or external shocks as seen in November. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">FX intervention and reserves levels. Indonesia’s floating regime has facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. Reserves are assessed to be adequate as assessed against the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric, sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined drains also manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at preventing disorderly market conditions, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.  </P><P MCID="13">_________________________________ </P><P MCID="14">1/ For more details, see Appendix II. </P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16"></P><P MCID="17"> </P><P MCID="18"> </P><P MCID="19"></P><P MCID="20">  </P><P MCID="21">Indonesia: Estimated Policy Contributions                                           to Current Account Gap, 2016(In percent of GDP)Actual CA-2.0CA norm-0.6 to -2.6Estimated CA gap-0.8 to 1.2Of which:-2.0Partners' fiscal deficits1.0Domestic public health spending0.51/ Negative value implies REER is below levels consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies.Cyclically-adjusted CA-1.4EBA REER index and level gaps 1/                   -3.4 and 3.2 percentStaff-assessed CA REER gap 1/-6 to 4 percent Residual</P></page>

Indonesia: Monetary Operation Reforms </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Backdrop for reforms. Since 2010, the transmission of the policy rate had weakened, as the overnight (O/N) interbank interest rate hovered near the floor of the interest rate corridor represented by Bank Indonesia’s deposit facility rate (as a Standing Facility), reflecting ample liquidity arising from large capital inflows. This opened up a divergence of as much as 200 basis points between O/N interbank rates and the stated policy rate. Without a transacted anchor at the shortend of the yield curve, the interbank money market has also failed to develop a viable interest rate structure, notably for tenors of 3 months to 12 months. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Bank Indonesia has launched a series of reforms to improve the transmission of monetary policy operations, including: </P><P MCID="5"> Shifting the policy rate to the BI 7-day reverse repo rate, a risk free rate actually transacted by the BI with the money market. The shift did not change the monetary policy stance.  </P><P MCID="6"> Narrowing the interest rate corridor between the overnight Lending Facility and Deposit Facility, reverting to a mid-corridor system at ±75 bps around the new policy rate.  </P><P MCID="7"> Managing the transition well, ably communicating to the markets. During the period, BI absorbed more liquidity at the longer tenors of the term structure, helping keep excess liquidity in the overnight deposit facility contained, and implemented measures to strengthen the interbank rate mechanism (JIBOR). To further sensitize market participants to the impending shift, BI published the term structure of its monetary operations (up to one year) in its monetary policy statements since May 2016, to provide a reliable rate structure for market reference. </P><P MCID="8"> Announcing reserve requirement averaging. In November 2016, BI indicated that it was preparing for implementation of a reserve requirement averaging scheme in the second half of 2017, which would </P><P MCID="9">further incentivize banks’ liquidity management and strengthen policy transmission. </P><P MCID="10">Further reforms are recommended to strengthen transmission and deepen the money markets: </P><P MCID="11"> Shifting from fixed-rate to variable-rate auctions, for the 3 to 12 month tenors, to encourage market participants to transact for price discovery and shape the yield curve.  </P><P MCID="12"> Removing transmission constraints to deposit rates, notably ceilings for large banks and maximum guaranteed deposit rates.  </P><P MCID="13"> Completing the short-term risk-free yield curve by gradually expanding issuance of short-tenor treasury bills as instruments to underpin interbank money market transactions, including repos.  </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17"> </P><P MCID="18"></P><P MCID="19"></P><P MCID="20"> </P><P MCID="21"></P><P MCID="22"></P><P MCID="23"> </P></page>

Indonesia: Update on Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA)1 </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">The pattern of intersectoral funding and exposures is broadly unchanged between end2014 and end-2015. Nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) borrowing from the rest of the world (ROW), in the form of both FDI and otherwise, remains the largest exposure in the BSA. The rupiah depreciated approximately 10 percent in U.S. dollar terms as of mid-2016, which inflates all BSA positions denominated in foreign currency proportionately. After correcting for this development, NFC borrowing from the ROW has significantly decreased by 20 percent. The largest change in exposure stems from a 30 percent increase of government borrowing from the ROW. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">Stress-testing demonstrates the impact of a combined depreciation (25 percent) and capital outflow shock (10 percent).2 In this scenario, NFCs lose 10 percent of their funding from the ROW, while existing liabilities increase by 25 percent in national currency terms. In a second round, NFCs replace the missing funding with bank funding (or deposit withdrawal), thereby passing on the shock to the banking system. After the shock, liabilities of NFCs with both ROW and banks increase by about 4 percent. The shock also affects government debt which increases by 4 percent of GDP. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">_____________________________ </P><P MCID="9">1/ Prepared by Elena Loukoianova and Giovanni Ugazio (STA). </P><P MCID="10">2/ See </P><Span MCID="11">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2016/cr1682.pdf</Span><P MCID="12"> for methodology and discussion. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17"></P><P MCID="18"> </P><P MCID="19">GovernmentCentral BankBanksNBFIsNFCsHHsROWGovernment-0.12%0.19%0.00%0.00%0.00%4.34%Central bank0.12%0.57%0.00%0.00%0.00%-3.08%Banks-0.19%-0.57%0.00%-4.78%0.41%0.46%NBFIs0.00%0.00%0.00%-0.19%0.00%0.17%NFCs0.00%0.00%4.78%0.19%4.07%HHs0.00%0.00%-0.41%0.00%0.00%ROW-4.34%3.08%-0.46%-0.17%-4.07%0.00%Sources: IMF; and IMF staff estimates.

Private Investment in Indonesia </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Indonesia has seen a marked slowdown in private investment. While investment globally and in the region has decelerated, Indonesia’s investment has slowed more markedly than that of peers. Over the past several years, investment has become more important in Indonesia as a source of growth, accounting for a third of economic output. The investment slowdown mainly reflects weak private investment, in contrast with a pickup in public investment. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Cyclical factors related to both the commodity down-cycle and subsequent economic downturn have hampered private investment. After a commodity-related investment boom prior to 2013, commodity prices have slumped, pushing down investment growth. The subsequent economic slowdown affected sectors beyond commodities, notably manufacturing. Capacity utilization in mining and manufacturing also fell and remains subdued, accompanied by a sharp fall in selling prices. With cash flows decreasing, corporates responded by cutting costs, postponing investment and laying off workers. Since a number of corporates still rely on internal cash flows for funding, a prolonged weakness in commodity prices and soft economic growth has reduced financing capacity for investment. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Structural constraints have also affected private investment, resulting in weakened linkages with global value chains. Investment has been constrained by weak infrastructure, rigid labor markets and labor skills gaps, as well as regulatory risk and uncertainty. Also financial constraints have been a factor, as some banks have tightened their lending standards amid higher NPLs. While the business climate has started to improve on the back of the authorities’ reforms, important challenges remain.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">In contrast, public investment is rising, led by local governments and SOEs, with progress made in PPPs.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10"> The central government is increasingly channeling investment through local governments and encouraging SOEs to ramp up capital spending. Capital expenditure of SOEs doubled in 2016, and are expected to rise by around 35 percent in 2017, aimed at meeting infrastructure development needs (text chart). To strengthen investment capacity, the government capitalized selected SOEs in the energy, food, and infrastructure sectors in 2016 (amounting to about 0.4 percent of GDP). In 2017, the government is planning to establish six holding companies in different sectors to increase their financial leverage and reduce duplication.  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"> The authorities have also made some recent progress with PPPs. Several projects have started, including the landmark project of 2 GW Central Java Power Plant, with the investment amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP, partly funded by overseas investors. Considerations are also being given to diversifying funding sources, such as securitizing existing infrastructure and promoting SOE joint ventures with the private sector. The government also has increased the number of priority projects to 30 from 22 projects aimed to start by end-2018 (equivalent to 8 percent of GDP), where SOEs and PPPs are expected to play an important role.  </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17"></P><P MCID="18"> </P><P MCID="19"></P></page>

Tighter funding conditions put additional pressure on the balance of payments (BOP), government financing, and the financial and corporate sectors. Bank funding could become constrained, raising domestic borrowing costs. Rollover risks rise for corporate external debt.

Preserve a sound fiscal position, while allowing automatic stabilizers to work in case of an extreme economic slowdown and using contingent financing if market access is restricted. Monetary policy tightening would need to be combined with targeted measures to alleviate funding pressures faced by some segments of the banking system and preserve financial stability to avoid reinforcing financial stresses brought on by market volatility and capital outflows.

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 percent and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively. </P><P MCID="89"></P><P MCID="90"> </P></page>

Growth in private external debt is expected to remain slow, partly contained by the BI’s FX hedging regulations and less favorable global financial conditions. Public debt remains low, but contingent liabilities arising from borrowing by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development may pose some fiscal risk, which should continue to be carefully monitored. Reliance on foreign investors remains sizable, which could leave Indonesia susceptible to external shocks and funding stops. </P><P MCID="8">External Debt Sustainability </P><P MCID="9">Indonesia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilized after a steady increase in recent years, and total external debt remains at a moderate level. As a share of GDP, external debt was 36 percent at end-2015, up from 25 percent at end-2011, reflecting a rise in general government borrowing, through internationally issued bonds and holdings of nonresidents of domestic bonds, and private external borrowing, mainly through loans and debt securities, including by SOEs. As growth in external borrowing has slowed and pressures on the exchange rate have reduced, external debt is expected to decline to 34 percent of GDP at end2016 (Figure 1 and Table 1).  </P><P MCID="10">Looking ahead, the external debt is projected to gradually decline in the medium term. Under the baseline, debt would decline to 25¾percent by end-2021 in line with favorable real GDP growth and a slower buildup in nonbank private sector debt due to BI’s FX hedging requirements and less favorable global financial conditions. Public external debt is expected to remain at low levels, as external borrowing of the public sector is tightly regulated by an inter-ministerial committee. Real GDP growth is projected to average about 5½ percent over the medium term. </P><P MCID="11">As in the last Article IV, external sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A further deterioration in the current account balance from the current level would cause the external debt ratio to rise moderately (a one-standard deviation shock would raise the external debt to GDP ratio to 30¾ percent by 2021). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact—a 30 percent depreciation in 2017 would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio to about 46¼ percent in 2017 followed by a gradual decline to 37 percent of GDP by 2021.  </P><P MCID="12">Public Debt Sustainability </P><P MCID="13">Public sector debt remains low in Indonesia. General government debt as a percent of GDP declined steadily from 87 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2015, owing to a prudent fiscal stance, which has been anchored by the fiscal rule since 2003. The rule caps the annual general government deficit at 3 percent of GDP. The debt dynamics have been also favorable, with strong GDP growth and moderate real interest rates. In 2016, the debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to increase to 28 percent of GDP (from 26.8 percent of GDP in 2015), reflecting slightly larger primary deficit than in </P></page>

At the same time, foreign-currency denominated debt has fallen to less than half of total public sector debt, as issuance in the domestic rupiah bond market has grown and attracted strong foreign interests. Notwithstanding, dependence on foreign investors remains sizable, with nonresidents holding about 60 percent of general government debt. Moreover, the share of foreign ownership of rupiah-denominated government bonds rose from about 20 percent in 2009 to about 37 percent as of end-November 2016. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to increase gradually over the medium term (Figure 3). The baseline envisages the general government deficit to remain constant at 2.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting in the primary deficit at ¾ percent of GDP through 2021. Favorable debt dynamics, with a negative interest rate-growth differential (about 5 percent over the medium term), would limit the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is expected to reach 29.4 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs are also expected to remain at around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Public debt dynamics are robust to both standard shocks and stress tests (Figures 4 and 5). Even under the most severe scenario with a combined macro-fiscal shock, total government debt would stabilize at 35 percent of GDP or 250 percent of revenue, with gross financing needs below 7 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, fiscal risks, in particular those arising from expanding balance sheets of key SOEs and PPPs, will need to be managed carefully. These modalities of investment are tasked with the bulk of infrastructure development, and strengthening public investment management will limit contingent liabilities arising from such entities and activities. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> </P></page>

Currently, the World Bank’s support is being provided through the Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) program, trust funds, and development policy loans (DPLs), with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations, including accounting reforms, improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform; (b) improved linkages between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of budget flexibility at the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight through systems and organizational reform. Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance launched SPAN in April 2015. SPAN, a financial management information system supported by GFMRAP, is designed to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability of the government’s financial transactions. An updated Public Expenditure review and further analysis in 2017 are informing the efficiency and effectiveness of government budgets. An ongoing Development Policy Loan (DPL) on fiscal reforms also supports reforms to enhance the allocative efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. The IMF has complemented this work through recent technical assistance (TA) on subsidy reform and social safety nets aimed at ensuring longer-run fiscal sustainability.  </P><P MCID="10">Taxation Issues </P><P MCID="11"> Revenue (tax and nontax revenue) issues are a priority for the IMF and the World Bank, with broadening the revenue base and increasing revenues an important issue for both macro-fiscal stability and the investment climate.

Most recently, this support has included analysis of the financial sector stability framework through the 2010 FSAP and a series of crisis simulation exercises. Preparation is underway for the next FSAP. Between 2012 and 2015, the Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) DPL, now disbursed and closed, has also supported the authorities in this area.

It has also embarked on TA in financial deepening, focused initially on money and foreign exchange market development and more recently on monetary operations and the transmission mechanism. In addition, the Fund has provided recent TA on the macro prudential policy framework and bank stress testing. A joint World Bank-IMF FSAP was completed in 2010 and some recommendations have been followed through by the authorities.

In general, GDP estimates are based on the latest international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data prepared but not published. BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with TA from STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize the annual nonfinancial accounts, financial flows, and stocks for the year 2010, and quarterly financial flows and stocks starting from Q1:2015 in 2017. A TA mission on Sectoral Accounts and Balance Sheets will be fielded in January 2017. </P><P MCID="12"></P><P MCID="13">Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. In October 2013, BPS released the new Producer Price Index (PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing with 2010 as the base period, and has published the PPI index quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and starting or completing work to further expand PPI coverage to include 15 service industries. There is a need to increase dissemination frequency and update the weights. Bank Indonesia and BPS have jointly begun work to expand the coverage of the residential property price index (RPPI) to include resales (the current RPPI includes only the sales of newly constructed units). It is planned that the new index will be released later in 2016. </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15">Government finance statistics (GFS): The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The authorities are continuing their efforts to adopt the GFSM 2001/2014 standards, with assistance from STA as part of a regional GFS project. Significant progress has been made in these areas and, in 2013, Indonesia reported for the first time to STA general government data (including balance sheet data) covering the period 2008 onwards. Aggregated data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month lag. Annual general government GFS are currently available 12 months after the end of the reference period and these data are published on the GFS website: http://www.gfs.djpbn.kemenkeu.go.id/en. The timeliness of the annual data will improve once all systems are in place.  </P><P MCID="16">The authorities have started to compile quarterly general government data in 2015. Quarterly general government GFS (operations statement) are available 6 months after the end of the reference quarter. The quarterly general government data are yet to be published on the GFS website because the authorities are planning to improve these data in terms of coverage of local governments and timeliness with the development of new regional financial information system. </P><P MCID="17">In late 2015, the authorities have started to develop methodology to compile quarterly general government data based on estimates of local government data.  </P><P MCID="18">The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics are generally adequate. </P><P MCID="19"></P><P MCID="20"> </P><P MCID="21"> </P><P MCID="22"> </P><P MCID="23"></P></page>

BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. With the support of a Fund TA mission in October 2014, BI expanded the coverage of the OFCs survey, which since January 2015 includes finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, the state owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export financing institution (Eximbank); achieving almost full coverage of the subsector. OFC data are reported on a monthly basis. The mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI compiles and reports to the Fund all (12) core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, all (two) encouraged FSIs for OFCs, two encouraged FSIs for nonfinancial corporations, one encouraged FSI for households, two encouraged FSIs for market liquidity, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published quarterly on the Fund’s FSI website. </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Balance of payments (BOP): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of BOP statistics.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have improved the coverage of the directory of enterprises in recent years. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item in the BOP has been large at times and appears to be related to the under coverage of assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP), except data on direct investment. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Annual and quarterly IIP data are compiled and published, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI, the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the private sector from external creditors. </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10">Data Standards and Quality</P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"></P><P MCID="13">Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS requirements.

The authorities are encouraged by staff’s acknowledgement of Indonesia’s robust macroeconomic performance, proper policy management and ongoing structural reforms. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Nevertheless, the authorities view that the policy recommendations and risk analyses need to consistently take into account the progress made thus far by the authorities as well as Indonesia’s solid and sound macroeconomic and financial conditions. Notable examples are in staff’s assessment of the external sector development and financial and corporate sector issues. As an illustration, adding the word ‘continue’ to the last sentence of the key issues section in the staff report (“….the policy strategy should continue to include actions to boost the economy’s resilience, …..”) would provide a more accurate picture of the Indonesian economy as well as acknowledge the efforts of the authorities. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">We view that against the risks mentioned, a qualifying opinion from staff to where Indonesia currently stands and its ability to weather the risks is very important. The absence of this qualifying opinion would result in a rather pessimistic assessment and draw unnecessary attention which is inconsistent with Indonesia’s economic resilience and positive prospects. As Article IV is an important reference for the global community at large, we view it is imperative for the analysis to put more weight on coherence rather than completeness. This is important for Indonesia as well as for other emerging market economies as an overemphasis of risk aspects could affect the confidence of investors and financial market participants which is unfair to the country. In this respect, we wish to highlight the following areas. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">Recent Economic Developments and Outlook </P><P MCID="13">Indonesian economic policies are guided by a sound macropolicy direction which enables the economy to withstand volatile external conditions. Notwithstanding the complexity of the policy challenges emanating from the external headwinds and the on-going structural reforms in the domestic economy, the authorities have employed a so called “Bauran Kebijakan” or “the policy mix strategy”. This policy mix strategy allows the authorities to determine a harmonious combination among monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies to ensure a more sustainable and inclusive economic growth. For instance, during the episode of taper tantrum, the </P></page>

Following a clearer direction in the US monetary policy normalization, the authorities shifted the strategy by using monetary policy primarily to support growth while pursuing fiscal consolidation to retain credibility. In the current complex situation, the macroeconomic strategy places greater weight on stability, while using structural reforms to strengthen growth. Throughout these periods, the policy combination is not only accompanied by deeper and stronger structural reforms but also a more flexible exchange rate regime, ample reserve level, calibrated macro-prudential policy and better communication strategy. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">The above strategies have resulted in the Indonesian economy performing well among peers (recorded the third highest growth among G20 countries). The economy grew by 5.02 percent in the third quarter of 2016, bringing the estimated economic growth to 5 percent for the whole year. Inflation, at 3.02 percent in 2016, was at the lower range of the inflation target of 4 ± 1 percent. Fiscal deficit stood at 2.46 percent of GDP, while public debt remained low and manageable at 27.7 percent of GDP at the end of 2016, with well diversified currency composition (almost 60 percent in Rupiah-denominated debt) and debt maturity (weighted average of 9 years). The balance of payments recorded a larger surplus in the third quarter of 2016, supported by a narrower current account deficit and a larger capital and financial account surplus. The 2016 current account deficit is expected to be below 2 percent of GDP. International reserves remained sufficient at USD116.4 billion as of December 2016, equivalent to 8.4 months of imports and official debt repayment. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Consistency in maintaining macroeconomic stability while optimizing economic growth has safeguarded the economy’s resilience and is recognized by international community. In December 2016, Fitch revised Indonesia’s outlook to Positive and affirmed the Investment Grade. Correspondingly, the implementation of structural reforms has contributed to the significant improvement in Indonesia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Index. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Indonesia’s economic outlook is expected to further improve. The economy is projected to grow between 5.0–5.4 percent in 2017, supported by solid domestic demand and a recovery in exports, along with improvement in prices of Indonesia’s export commodities. The government is expected to record a prudent fiscal deficit in 2017 coupled with a more realistic tax revenue target and better subsidy scheme. The 2017 budget will be primarily allocated to productive spending to support the growth momentum and improve infrastructure and basic services, including education, health and social welfare. Meanwhile, the current account deficit is expected to remain below 3 percent of GDP. The authorities will carefully monitor the impact of the plan to lower subsidy on some tariffs, such as electricity, on inflation, and will ensure that inflation expectations are firmly anchored. In addition, financial stability and corporate sector conditions are also expected to further improve in line with a better economic outlook. </P><P MCID="7"> </P></page>

The authorities wish to highlight staff’s assessment that Indonesia’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Further, staff also assessed that reserves are sufficient and that in the event of severe external pressure, exchange rate flexibility would help contain risks. While staff has rightly stressed that global uncertainty can have downside risk to the economy, the authorities wonder what is staff’s final assessment of the resiliency of the Indonesian economy. Further, we would like to point out that the external risks mentioned are a global phenomenon not unique to Indonesia. Against this backdrop, the authorities would like to underline their confidence in weathering future external shocks, namely due to 3 factors: (i) sound macroeconomic discipline; (ii) intensive monitoring of debt characteristics and compositions; and (iii) sound prudential policy to mitigate risks. </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">On sound macroeconomic discipline, the authorities focused on three major areas, namely a sustainable current account deficit (CAD), more flexible exchange rate and sufficient level of reserves. Indonesia’s CAD has been on a declining trend and is consistent with medium-term economic fundamentals. Over the years, the CAD has declined from 3.19 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.06 percent of GDP in 2015. By the end of 2016, the CAD is projected to be below 2 percent of GDP. The authorities are committed to further safeguard the CAD within its medium-term sustainable level and to improve competitiveness and promote exports which would in turn further improve the CAD. On the exchange rate, Indonesia has implemented a more flexible exchange rate regime in line with its fundamental value. Exchange rate flexibility has helped increase the resilience of the external sector as reflected in improvements in the CAD. Meanwhile, international reserves are sufficient at USD116.4 billion as of December 2016, equivalent to 8.4 months of imports and official debt repayment. The reserves are further supported by the availability of a second line of defense from bilateral, regional and global financial arrangements which provide further buffers against external shocks. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">The authorities will continue to monitor debt characteristics and compositions. Currently, Indonesia has a healthy International Investment Position structure, where net external liabilities are mostly long-term (FDI and long term loans) that will provide positive trickle-down effects on long-term economic activities and growth. Indonesia’s long-term foreign borrowing amounts to 87.5 percent of total foreign borrowings with a balanced share between public and private debt. Short-term debt of private non-bank corporations amounts to only 5 percent of total foreign debt. Further, non-resident holders of Indonesian government bond are also dominated by long-term investors, including central banks. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">In addition to implementing a strong policy framework, the authorities will continue to adopt necessary prudential regulations to maintain and strengthen external resiliency. To ensure prudent external debt management, the authorities have since end-2014 implemented prudential </P></page>

This is in addition to the 3 percent fiscal deficit ceiling introduced by the State Law, a special committee to administer and approve the SOEs’ related loans, and existing banking prudential regulations on loan and foreign exchange exposures. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Financial and Corporate Sector Issues </P><P MCID="3">The authorities wish to highlight that the Indonesian financial and corporate sectors remain resilient and well placed to weather the current uncertain global conditions. As noted by staff, the banking system is well capitalized and profitable, with ample liquidity. The capital adequacy ratio stood at 23 percent at end-November 2016, well above the international standard. Meanwhile, ample liquidity is reflected in the low level of volatility of interbank market rate and the ratio of liquid assets to third party fund, which stood at 20.5 percent at end-November 2016. Latest data have also signaled that NPLs’ growth is reaching its peak in addition to improved corporate performance, especially in the commodity-related sector. Taking into account the positive outlook of the Indonesian economy and the rising commodity prices, risks emanating from the banking and corporate sectors are expected to moderate in the future. In sum, the authorities would like to underline a very important conclusion of the risk assessment on the banking and corporate sectors, namely that none of the identified risks triggers systemic concerns in the financial system, despite the said “pockets of vulnerability” in those areas. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">To ensure that no vulnerability in the banking and corporate sectors persist, the authorities regularly monitor and conduct stress tests in compliance with international best practices. The results again confirmed that there is no systemic risk. As an example, the result of the authorities’ stress test on liquidity shock showed that only 1 (one) small-sized banks (out of 118 banks) encountered a liquidity problem due to its reliance on short-term deposits. Nevertheless, the authorities assessed that the problem to be temporary and not a structural issue. Sufficient access to liquidity both from money market and the central bank is also available to the bank. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">The same strong conclusion on the absence of systemic risk also hold true for the corporate sector. The authorities believe that corporate vulnerability will also decline in line with improvements in corporate performance as reflected in increasing profitability (data up to September 2016). This is further bolstered by improved efficiency including a tendency among corporations to reduce debts. In addition, the authorities would also like to refer to the analysis from related working paper1 draft by staff which states that risks in the Indonesian corporate sector are manageable and that the authorities have been proactive in monitoring corporate </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="8">1 Chan-Lau, J.

The above reference simply reinstated that there are no systemic risks stemming from the corporate sector. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">In this regard, the authorities would like to convey the need to have a coherent assessment on the banking and corporate sectors to understand the depth of the problem and the ability of the authorities to handle the issues. Emphasizing the analysis on the risks would overshadow the progress made by the authorities in strengthening the resilience of the financial and corporate sectors and to address pockets of vulnerabilities. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Fiscal Policy and Reforms </P><P MCID="5">On the fiscal front, the authorities appreciate staff recognition that the fiscal strategy is appropriate. The government has embarked on a gradual fiscal consolidation while protecting infrastructure priority spending. The tax amnesty program launched by the government has been successful in collecting significant tax payments and repatriated funds as well as expanding the revenue base. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">Going forward, the authorities are committed to implement a growth-friendly fiscal strategy and concurred with staff’s assessment that revenue mobilization will be challenging. Nevertheless, the authorities’ commitment to achieving revenue targets remain unwavering. This effort will be supported by several factors, namely: (i) a new larger tax base as a result of information obtained through tax amnesty; (ii) potential for further revenue-raising reforms with the creation of a tax reform team in January 2017. The team will also help improve the organization and clarity of the tax reforms roadmap, which will improve credibility of the tax revenue target; (iii) plan to improve the information system to capitalize on the readily available information from tax amnesty; (iv) efforts to address complications in tax regulations as well as to implement tax policy and administration reforms by way of amendments to the VAT law and income tax law are also underway; (v) electronic invoicing. With the above progress and strategies, it is also worth noting that tax revenues will also move in line with the tax buoyancy rate. The authorities have also continued to work closely with the IMF through Technical Assistance to further improve the fiscal position. </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">Structural Reforms </P><P MCID="10">The authorities have embarked on a series of structural reforms to improve the economy’s competitiveness and the business climate. Focus areas of the reform are on improving the ease of doing business, providing good infrastructure, diversifying sources of growth (including developing the tourism sector and more value added export products), improving purchasing power and deepening the financial market. As staff noted, there are signs of early successes, as shown in the improvement of Indonesia’s ranking in the Doing Business Index, which in 2016 moved up 15 positions to 91. The deep and intensive reforms are aimed at supporting the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2014-2019 which is led directly by the President. </P></page>

The objective of the OSS center is to accelerate and simplify licensing procedures for investment projects by placing the licensing processes for all businesses (except those in the banking and energy sectors) that were handled by 22 ministries and government agencies under one roof. The business climate has been further improved by the introduction of the 3-hour investment licensing service in January 2016 and the 10th Policy Package on Negative Investment List in February 2016. As many as 130 companies with investment value of IDR291 trillion have benefited from the OSS service up to October 2016. Meanwhile, up to June 2016, 527 companies have applied to invest with total planned investment of USD12.9 billion as a result of the revised Negative Investment List.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Debottlenecking effort was also done to accelerate the implementation of priority infrastructure projects. Recognizing the need to improve infrastructure, the authorities have established a body under the Economic Coordinating Minister as a Project Management Office (KPPIP) to administer 30 priority infrastructure projects, ranging from electricity, energy, seaport, airport and toll roads. One notable progress of this body is the revision of the Law on Land Acquisition for Public Interest which sets a maximum time to complete the land acquisition process, the biggest hurdle in undertaking infrastructure projects. To date, many projects, such as the Trans Sumatra Toll Road Project and Java North Line Double Track Rail Project, have benefited from the revision of this regulation. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Conclusion </P><P MCID="7">The Indonesian economy is progressing well with well-preserved macroeconomic and financial stability. The authorities have proven their resolute commitment and are well prepared to tackle prolonged global uncertainty with appropriate policies. The authorities believe that combining policy mix with appropriate structural reforms provides optimal result for an emerging market economy such as Indonesia. To that extent, the authorities will continue its unwavering commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability and broad-based structural reforms. We believe that this commitment is a major factor in shaping the economy’s agility in weathering shifts in the external environment and has been well tested in several episodes of global financial turbulence as well as during the period of commodity down-cycle. </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"> </P></page>
