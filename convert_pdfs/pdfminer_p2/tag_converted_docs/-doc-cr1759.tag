Directors noted the progress made in strengthening debt management, the business climate, and key social indicators. While the medium term outlook is favorable, challenges and risks remain. Going forward, Directors highlighted the need for strong commitment to the Fund supported program which supports the authorities’ Economic Development Document aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic framework, while creating fiscal space for the needed infrastructure and social spending. Progress on structural reforms will be key to reducing poverty and creating jobs. </P><P Lang="en" MCID="1"> </P><P Lang="en" MCID="2">Directors welcomed the approval of the 2017 budget which appropriately takes into account capacity constraints and sets a realistic basis for fiscal consolidation over the medium term. They highlighted the importance of improving revenue mobilization by broadening the tax base, including by reducing tax exemptions, and strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Directors also emphasized the importance of prioritizing public spending and enhancing expenditure control and liquidity management, while strengthening resilience to natural disasters.  </P><P Lang="en" MCID="3"> </P><P Lang="en" MCID="4">Directors considered it important to strengthen capital project and debt management framework. They welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to undertake a prudent debt policy, while improving project evaluation based on cost effectiveness, and encouraged them to exercise caution with regard to scaling up debt financed investments. Strengthening the transparent management of natural resources and the public private partnership framework will also be vital.  </P><P Lang="en" MCID="5"> </P><P Lang="en" MCID="6">Directors underscored that financial sector deepening will play an important role in making growth more inclusive. They encouraged the authorities to step up the implementation of their Financial Inclusion Strategy and the National Financial Sector Development Strategy. At the same time, banking supervision should be strengthened in line with regional agreements.  </P><P Lang="en" MCID="7"> </P><P Lang="en" MCID="8">Directors emphasized that giving priority to gender equity, disaster risk management, and harnessing the demographic dividend is critical for achieving Niger’s medium term growth potential, creating jobs, and reducing poverty.

Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 5.2 percent in 2017, driven by agriculture and an expected pick-up in oil production. Inflation is expected to remain contained below 2 percent. Real GDP growth is expected to average 6.1 percent during 2018-21, mainly as a result of the expansion of the extractive industries sector and an increase in public and private investments.

Economic growth is estimated to have increased to 4.6 percent in 2016 from 3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a strong 2016-17 crop year and despite continued weakness in the oil and mining sectors, adverse spillovers from the economic downturn in Nigeria and continued elevated security threats. Inflation remains subdued. Notwithstanding recent macroeconomic gains, Niger still ranks last on the UN’s Human Development Index with growth barely above the estimated rate of population growth (4.1 percent a year). President Issoufou secured a second term in the presidential and legislative elections held in February-March 2016, with the new administration reaffirming a focus on reinvigorating growth to create more employment opportunities, including by addressing infrastructure gaps, while strengthening food security.  </P><P MCID="4">Article IV Consultation. Discussions focused on the key components of Niger’s inclusive growth agenda, in particular: (i) reducing gender inequality; (ii) improving prevention and response to natural disasters; and (iii) harnessing the demographic dividend. </P><P MCID="5">Request for an Extended Credit Facility arrangement. In the attached letter of intent, the authorities request a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of SDR 98.7 million (75 percent of quota) in support of their medium-term economic program as described in the government’s Economic Development Document (EDD). While preserving macroeconomic stability remains a key objective, the program design acknowledges the protracted balance of payment needs and the likely continued elevated security spending and therefore the need to enhance fiscal space to ensure that development objectives can be attained. Fiscal space is to be enhanced by broadening the tax base and strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Expenditure management focuses on prioritizing public spending and enhancing expenditure control and liquidity management. A strong reform agenda buttresses the program, with the growth agenda anchored on more efficient investment, as well as an improved business climate and more inclusive financial development.  </P><P MCID="6">  </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"> December 22, 2016 </P></page>

Niger faces major development and security challenges, but the political situation is stable. Despite significant improvements in social indicators over the last two decades, more than half of the population lives below the poverty line of less than US$1.90 (PPP-adjusted) a day  (Text Figure 1a). The economy is still dominated by subsistence agriculture, which is hampered by frequent floods and droughts, and the prevalence of rudimentary techniques that hold back productivity. Since 2012, heightened armed hostilities across Niger’s borders have caused major humanitarian and economic crises. Such hostilities periodically claim lives, destroy property and infrastructure, disrupt domestic production and trade flows, and have resulted in an estimated 350,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (Text Figure 1b). As a result, security-related spending rose from 1.5 to 5.2 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2015, leading to higher budget deficits and diversion of spending from social priorities.   </P><P MCID="3">Text Figure 1a.

This Committee is headed by a permanent secretariat which coordinates debt policy across all ministries and ensures that every debt contracted is consistent with debt sustainability. Progress has also been made on improving the business climate, as Niger moved up from a rank of 176th out of 189 countries in the 2014 World Bank Doing Business Report to 150th out of 190 countries on the 2017 Report.

Economic growth is estimated to have risen to 4.6 percent in 2016 (below the earlier projection of 5.2 percent), compared with 3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a good agricultural season and an expansion of crop irrigation that boosted agricultural production by nearly 8 percent. However, the resumption of oil production was slower than expected and government spending was constrained by lower revenue, in addition to adverse security developments, and the economic slowdown in neighboring countries affecting the services sector. </P><P MCID="7">4.      Inflation remains well below the West African Economic Monetary Union’s (WAEMU) “three percent” convergence criterion (Table 2). Reflecting the good 2016-17 harvest and the government’s food security programs that play a stabilizing role, domestic food prices declined and thus consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2015 and through October 2016 at around 1 percent annualized. Weak oil prices further contributed to price stability (Figure 2).  </P><P MCID="8">5.

The shortfall in corporate taxes was estimated at CFAF 20.5 billion in 2016 because advances paid in 2015 were higher than assessed taxes in 2016, permitting more deductions than projected. In addition, the depreciation of the Naira induced a diversion to the domestic parallel market of refined petroleum products.1 This diversion and depreciation contributed also to the overall decline of exports and re-exports to Nigeria, and to higher imports from Nigeria. As a result, at end-September 2016, VAT collections fell short by CFAF 30 billion, the special tax on petroleum products by CFAF 5.4 billion, and customs taxes by CFAF 26.2 billion.  </P><P MCID="1"> At end-June, domestically financed spending was under-executed relative to program targets, resulting in a basic balance in line with the program target. The government also cleared all  end-2014 arrears. But at end-September, security and social spending pressures led to a deterioration of fiscal outcomes. </P><P MCID="2"> End-September outcomes suggested the need for a downward revision of the end-2016 revenue target to reflect a projected shortfall estimated at CFAF 114.5 billion (2.6 percent of GDP). To offset it, the government took strong measures to contain spending by freezing planned non-priority-expenditures (including CFAF 48.2 billion in current spending), while safeguarding salaries, debt service payments, and security spending.2 The increase in the basic balance deficit was limited to CFAF 24.3 billion and to be financed domestically by CFAF 14.3 billion and by a slightly slower pace of reduction of domestic arrears.  </P><P MCID="3">6.      Broad money in the nine months through September 2016 increased by 9 percent, which is in line with estimates of economic activity (Table 4). Official net foreign assets decreased by 20 percent compared to end 2015, as the external budget support envisaged for the second half of the year will only be disbursed at the end of the year. Credit to the private sector also increased by 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, a deceleration relative to the previous year. Credit to the government increased by CFAF 98 billion from end 2015 as the government, faced with lower foreign support, turned to domestic financing.  </P><P MCID="4">7.      The current account deficit is projected to decrease from 18.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 15.4 percent in 2016 (Table 5). This reflects a reduction in imports that more than offsets the fall in goods exports due to low international prices for uranium and petroleum products, and the economic slowdown in Nigeria.

Outlook and Risks </P><P MCID="1">8.      Niger’s overall economic outlook remains positive. Growth is projected to rise to  5.2 percent in 2017, and to average 5.4 percent during 2017-19, driven by the expansion of irrigated agriculture under the national food security program (3N Initiative). The main natural resource projects—an oil pipeline through Chad and the Imouraren uranium mine—are now expected to be completed in 2020 and 2021, respectively, providing for a boost to growth beginning in 2020. The current account deficit is projected to rise to about an average of 18.6 percent of GDP in 2017-19 driven by capital and intermediate goods imports associated with FDI and the government’s investment program. Exports are expected to improve from higher gold production and agricultural products boosted by investments under the recently signed compact between Niger and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Inflation is expected to remain subdued at about 2 percent. Gross official reserves are projected to remain stable at 4 months of import of goods and services. </P><P MCID="2">9.      The exchange rate remains broadly in line with model-based estimates of fundamentals, but broader competitiveness indicators point to major challenges (Text Table 1). Consistent with the regional 2016 WAEMU external stability assessment, the EBA-lite methodology suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) during 2015 was broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. But the recent Naira’s depreciation could lead to a weakening of Niger’s competitiveness. In addition, broader competitiveness indicators, such as the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators, highlight significant structural gaps in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes (Background note on External Stability Assessment). </P><P MCID="3">Text Table 1.

On the upside, a rebound in uranium and oil prices or a pickup in the Nigerian economy would boost Niger’s fiscal space and growth. </P><P MCID="1">11.      To illustrate some of these risks, staff developed two alternative scenarios. The scenarios simulate security and terms of trade shocks (Figure 5).3 In both scenarios, staff assume that exports from the new resource projects will be delayed by one year as a result of the shock. The simulation results show, in 2017, a decline in GDP growth of 0.3 to 0.8 percentage points, and a deterioration of the current account of 0.8 to 1.7 percent of GDP, and a fall in reserves. The fiscal stance would also deteriorate as revenue would fall and security spending expand. From a DSA perspective, while under the security shock the debt ratios would remain under their respective thresholds, the large impact of the terms of trade shock on exports would cause the debt-to-export ratio to exceed the 150 percent threshold by 15.4 percent in 2017. In addition, based on earlier work, staff found that climatic shocks4 have a large and persistent impact on Niger’s economic activity, but with limited impact on consumer prices, inter alia due to the government’s mitigating policies in place (IMF, 2012). Also, staff estimates that a natural disaster causing losses of 0.5 percent of GDP would have a weak fiscal impact but could be magnified in terms of economic growth and the current account deficit.  </P><P MCID="2">12.      Niger has been adversely impacted by spillovers from its main trading partner, Nigeria (Box 1). The spread of terrorist attacks into Niger remains a key risk. The economic downturn in Nigeria, together with the sharp exchange rate depreciation and restrictions on access to foreign exchange since late 2014, have contributed to Niger’s conventional exports to Nigeria falling by 16 percent in 2015, and re-exports by 17 percent resulting in significant customs revenue losses. Also, at end-June 2016 exports to Nigeria had fallen by 45.4 percent compared to end-June 2015.5 Niger’s growth prospects are also vulnerable to spillovers from neighboring Chad, as the construction of the crude oil pipeline connection depends on security conditions there.  </P><P MCID="3">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="4">3 In the security shock scenario, staff consider an increase of security-related spending equivalent to 1 percent of GDP that affects trade and other economic activities.

This trend continued during 2016 with re-exports falling by a further 15 percent, and export falling by 45.4 percent on an annual basis, at end-June, leading to a large loss in customs revenue.

Preventing and Managing Natural Disasters </P><P MCID="2">16.      More frequent natural disasters periodically inflict substantial economic and social losses in Niger (Background Paper on Managing and Preventing Natural Disasters, Text Figure 4). Such disasters are linked to geographical conditions, climate change and high population growth. Dependence on rain-fed agriculture based on rudimentary technology has left Niger vulnerable to droughts and locust plagues that result in periodic food shortages. Floods also continue to cause significant damage in riverside communities, claiming lives and properties. Recent food crises (2005 and 2010) showed that a timely response coordinated through monitoring system (Early Warning System-EWS) could mitigate the impact of basic cereal shortages. </P><P MCID="3">17.

Furthermore, staff highlighted the importance of coordination of all agencies involved in the framework to improve the response system.8 </P><P MCID="2">C.   Harnessing the Demographic Dividend </P><P MCID="3">19.      Niger has the world’s fastest growing population, offering a prospective demographic dividend that can be captured with well-designed policies (Background Note on Harnessing the Demographic Dividend in Niger: Opportunities and Challenges). The significant decline in the mortality rate indicates that Niger has started its demographic transition. However, with the highest fertility rate in the world of 7.6 children per woman, Niger’s population growth rate has accelerated to 4.1 percent a year. The resulting young and growing labor force bodes well for economic growth, but adequate policies are needed to provide education and jobs for the youth to capture potential demographic dividend expected from 2020. Current projections suggest that the dividend could be low in terms of income per capita gains, but would last beyond 2100. Until then, the share of the working age population will be lower and the dependency ratio higher than the average levels reached by other regions that have already enjoyed large demographic dividends (Text Figure 5).  </P><P MCID="4">20.      The authorities showed strong commitment to seizing the demographic transition opportunities, but foresee pressing and long-term challenges. To that end, they have been implementing policies to reduce the fertility rate, promote vocational education, and create more job opportunities. To reduce fertility, they have adopted a bottom-up approach (focusing on local communities) which, they noted, has proven effective in overcoming to some extent the resistance of religious leaders. Specific actions include: (i) launching in 2012 of informal education venues (“école des maris”), intended to promote and facilitate family planning through increased involvement of husbands; and (ii) initiating in November 2015 the Sahel Women's Empowerment and Demographic Dividend project (SWEDD), supported by the World Bank and the United Nations </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">7 The authorities informed that Niger subscribed to Africa Risk Capacity (ARC), a sovereign drought insurance for African Union member countries. </P><P MCID="6">8 In addition to the DNPGCCA and 3N Initiative, ad hoc structures were set up for specific missions; a Ministry in charge of Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management was created in May 2016.

Remaining challenges revolve around:  (i) improving the income level of households; (ii) boosting resilience of the communities faced with frequent disasters through appropriate food policies and strategies; (iii) financing of agriculture and infrastructure; and (iv) reinforcing best practices, with the aim of consolidating the proper functioning of public administration and delivery of public goods.  </P><P MCID="13"> The PDES’ successor, the EDD, laid out its objectives for 2016-19 building on the government’s long-term economic and social programs (Renaissance II, and Niger Vision 2035) and on the achievements and challenges of Niger’s PDES. The EDD aims first at further enhancing the macroeconomic environment to achieve accelerated growth and meet the dual objectives of improving incomes and job creation, while strengthening the foundations for sustainable development. The EDD estimates that annual growth of 7 percent is needed to achieve a significant sustained reduction in poverty and unemployment; and while the average rate of growth during the PDES 2012-15 was 6.6 percent, it was highly volatile, limiting its impact on reducing poverty.  </P><P MCID="14"></P></page>

Staff encouraged the authorities to reach understandings with the WAEMU Commission on a slight deferment of the budgetary convergence criterion. </P><P MCID="1">27.      Streamlining tax exemptions will be important to limit medium-term revenues losses (MEFP, ¶ 37 to 40). Over the last five years, tax exemptions have become sizeable, reaching about CFAF 80 billion in 2015 (1.7 percent of GDP) and CFAF 150 billion in 2015 (4.5 percent of GDP) for tax and customs revenues respectively. Thus going forward, the authorities are committed to bring tax exemptions currently under the Investment Code in line with best practices by reducing their number and streamlining their scope. To that end, a comprehensive review of the different allowances will lay out the necessary steps to combine overlapping fiscal advantages in sector-specific codes into the customs and tax codes. </P><P MCID="2">28.      Under the program, part of the fiscal space would be used to advance the inclusive growth agenda. In line with the broader strategy defined in the EDD, the authorities are committed to using part of the increased fiscal space under the new program to strengthen resilience to disasters and address issues in the areas of gender and demographics. Indeed, disasters affect longer term development through the damage of physical and human capital. On gender, while there has been strides in empowering women through education during the implementation of the PDES, gender inequality continues to lag. Accordingly, pro-poor spending is planned to increase by 36 percent in 2017 (Table 7). </P><P MCID="3">B.    Structural Reforms </P><P MCID="4">29.

The program steps up efforts to strengthen revenue collection agencies (MEFP, ¶ 41 to 52). It targets an increase in revenues to 17.5 percent of GDP by 2019, after which the anticipated increases in natural resource revenues would materialize. A comprehensive reform program is already underway, drawing on technical assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and AFTRIAC-West to address capacity constraints (Box 2).  </P><P MCID="7">  </P></page>

Niger: Revenue Mobilization and Liquidity Management </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">A strategy is in place to modernize customs administration while strengthening transparency and governance, with a view to enhancing performance (MEFP, ¶ 42-45). Some operations are being contracted out to enhance efficiency. The finalization of the electronic inter-connection of all the customs offices will be key to combat fraud. The deployment of ASYCUDA World Software supported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to all main offices not covered so far will pave the way for electronic customs transit, helping to broaden the tax base. With the introduction of tax identification numbers for all importers, the customs office will be able to perform risk based tax audits. Also the customs office is deepening its collaboration with the customs of Benin and Togo. </P><P MCID="3">Tax administration reforms aim at broadening the tax base and strengthening staff capacity through training. Reforms are supported by FAD technical assistance as well AFRITAC-West and focus mainly on continuing modernizing the management of tax administration’s operations through the improvement of tax collection, and the decentralization of the tax audit and control functions (MEFP, ¶ 46-51). To that end, the tax office will expand the competency of the large enterprises Directorate (DGE) to all the companies that meet the threshold (CFAF 500 million annual cash flow) regardless of their location. Thus, 120 companies that were previously under the jurisdiction of regional tax offices will be transferred to the DGE before end-2016. In addition, to further improve the coverage of the rapidly expending city of Niamey, the tax office will establish two tax assessment centers and two tax payment centers by June 2017 in Niamey. The tax office will also: (i) strengthen the tax audit function by joint customs and tax administration staff and decentralize the tax control unit to the regions; (ii) continue the ongoing project to provide a full information system that will improve transparency and reduce the risk of fraud; and (iii) finalize the measures to strengthen the reimbursement of VAT credit initiated in 2016, to strengthen VAT effectiveness. </P><P MCID="4">Enhanced management of tax exemptions will broaden the tax base. Improved monitoring and control of tax exemptions will be undertaken by revisiting existing exemption legislation and reinforcing the management of public enterprises (MEFP, ¶ 37-40). In that regard, the PPP framework will be reviewed and the government will consider transferring the tax provisions in the sector codes to the general tax and custom codes. Also, to limit the fiscal risks from public enterprises, an audit will be undertaken to clarify financial relations between the state and the main public enterprises. </P><P MCID="5">The Treasury office will strengthen accounting procedures, and improve non-tax revenue collection and liquidity management (MEFP, ¶ 52). Further modernization of accounting procedures will facilitate TSA implementation, with expected financing support from the European Union and technical support from FAD, this process will be supported by a long term IMF resident expert funded by the European Union. By end-March 2017, the government will sign the account management agreements with the BCEAO and the selected commercial banks and close all inactive accounts (compte dormants) (MEFP, ¶ 52 and 56). </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Public Financial Management and Liquidity Management </P><P MCID="9">31.      Public expenditure management and budget execution are being enhanced. The Inter-Ministerial Budgetary Committee that was created in Mid-2016 provides an effective mechanism for aligning expenditure commitments with resource availability, thereby preventing the incurrence of arrears. To strengthen planning and spending control, the preparation of annual budgets, starting from the 2018 budget, will be in line with the budget program framework under the 2012 budget law (MEFP, ¶ 56). On the basis of this framework, budget execution will be subject to commitment authorizations and payments credits, further enhancing investment efficiency. Full implementation of the TSA is expected during the program period (MEFP, ¶ 52). </P></page>

Recently contracted loans, though concessional, have raised public debt levels from 25.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 41.9 percent of GDP in 2015,12 due in part to public investment in the natural resources sector and in infrastructure, and to the securitization of domestic arrears. </P><P MCID="4">34.      In light of the DSA results, staff and the authorities concurred on the need to preserve debt sustainability. With limited fiscal space, the government is exploring options for public private partnership (PPP) investments as an alternative means to address infrastructure financing gaps. In this regard, staff noted the importance of strengthening the PPP framework, while continuing to strengthen the overall debt management framework by enhancing the capacity of the inter-ministerial committee on debt management. Staff urged the authorities to carefully assess the fiscal impact of the PPP contracts to ensure consistency with the external borrowing plan under the Debt Limits Policy, while reconsidering debt agreements signed but not yet become operational.  </P><P MCID="5">35.      Staff and the authorities agreed on the broader debt policy assessment and identified specific measures to strengthen debt management. The authorities agreed to suspend the conclusions of new PPP until the PPP framework is fully reviewed. To that end, they have requested FAD Technical Assistance. A mission is expected in early 2017 to help design a new framework based on an assessment of current risks. In updating the recent external borrowing plan prepared with the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department and the World Bank support (Table 11), the authorities are planning to restructure the debt portfolio by reconsidering pending conventions that are yet to become operational.  </P><P MCID="6">D.

Also, the financial situation of the public mine-holding company (SOPAMIN) has not improved, with most of its commercial contracts expiring this year and the company barely exporting its quota of uranium production. In the meantime, structural reforms in the oil sector are progressing with exports gradually liberalized, which is expected to better align incentives in the sector and improve its financial standing.  </P><P MCID="1">37.      The government has taken steps to improve the financial status of the national refinery, SORAZ. It lowered the crude oil price from Niger’s oil fields to US$45 per barrel from US$47, and increased the contractually determined price to the government-owned fuel distributor (SONIDEP) by CFAF 10 per liter. These measures are expected to restore a comfortable operating margin for the refinery.  </P><P MCID="2">38.      Despite the decline in commodity prices, staff noted that natural resource endowments will remain the major source to finance Niger’s development. Accordingly, staff urged the authorities to enhance natural resource revenue mobilization by strengthening revenue evaluation, forecasting, and audit capacities. Drawing on peer country experiences and based on recent FAD technical assistance, staff advised pursuing a stronger institutional framework for natural resource management. To continue strengthening the existing overall framework, the authorities expressed interest in resuming the FAD Technical Assistance initiated two years ago. More specifically, in the energy sector, staff welcomed the recently created Agence de Régulation du Secteur de l’Energie, which the authorities agreed to operationalize promptly.  </P><P MCID="3">E.   Business Environment </P><P MCID="4">39.      Niger’s business environment remains difficult despite recent improvements. The World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Index ranked Niger 150th out of 190 countries, up from 176th out of 189 countries in 2014, but still below other WAEMU members and SSA averages for some indicators (Figure 1). While the business environment in most WAEMU countries is weak in many aspects, dealing with construction regulations, and paying taxes were identified as particularly problematic in Niger. Other specific concerns identified by the local business community include: declining activity in the telecommunications sector following the introduction of a tax on incoming calls in 2014 and delays in processing reimbursements of VAT credits and of tax exemptions refunds. Staff commended the authorities for shortening the time and procedures required to start a business, improving access to credit information by establishing a credit bureau, and making contracts enforcement easier by creating a specialized commercial court. However, staff urged an acceleration of efforts, in particular improvements in tax administration. To sustain the improvement of competitiveness, the authorities will speed up measures aimed at overcoming barriers identified in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes. </P><P MCID="5">  </P></page>

Despite a significant improvement in the regional financial market, the domestic banking sector remains shallow, with limited financial instruments and four commercial banks controlling about 90 percent of total banking sector assets. The sectoral distribution of credit is skewed towards trade, services, and mining sectors, and Niger’s underdeveloped capital market is dominated by banks and the government. Agriculture, the largest contributor to economic growth, benefits marginally from bank financing. Key risks stem from growing exposures to the public sector, both through holding of government bonds and the incurrence of domestic arrears. Such arrears also hamper banks’ clients’ capacity to repay their loans. The authorities and staff concurred on the need to establish a consultative platform with the banking association.  </P><P MCID="4">42.      Staff highlighted the importance of strengthening Niger’s microfinance network to foster financial inclusion. Following the adoption in July 2015 of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, CFAF 300 million were earmarked in the 2016 budget for its implementation and another CFAF 300 million for the National Financial Sector Development Strategy (NFSDS) that was approved in late 2014. The objective is to make available through 2021, CFAF 35 billion in credits to small businesses, in particular those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The government plans to ask for donor assistance with this microfinance program at a forthcoming Round Table to be held in 2017.

The proposed access is above the norm for countries with Niger’s level of outstanding drawings from the PRGT but it is in line with established limits and commensurate with the proposed program strength and identified financing needs. The program will comprise six reviews, with disbursements phased evenly throughout the arrangement (Table 12). The program will include semi-annual performance criteria (PC) and an agenda of structural reforms (Tables 9, 10, and 11). PC will be established for end-June and end-December 2017 and Indicative Targets (IT) for end-March and September-2017.

Niger’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate, but subject to risks which program measures will mitigate. Given the strength of the program, the favorable medium-term outlook, and the results of the DSA, Niger denotes sufficient capacity to repay the Fund (Table 10), with repayment obligations to the Fund peaking at 1.2 percent of export revenue in 2023-24. Key risks remain security developments, adverse spillovers from neighboring countries, climatic shocks, and capacity constraints, all of which could impair program implementation. These risks would be mitigated under the program, including through building fiscal space, strengthening key institutions, and boosting growth’s resilience. Continued debt accumulation due to weak policy implementation and debt management capacity would have a major impact on debt sustainability.   </P><P MCID="8">45.      Safeguard assessments are conducted at the level of the regional central bank (BCEAO). The most recent assessment was completed in December 2013 and found a continuing strong control environment.

Over the medium term, growth is projected at  5.9 percent, driven by agriculture and the resource sector. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, anchored on the regional exchange rate arrangement.

Also, broader competitiveness indicators point to major challenges, though significant improvement has been recorded in the 2017 World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators.  </P><P MCID="1">48.      Achieving Niger’s medium-term growth potential and ensuring inclusiveness will require enhancing the management of natural disasters, creating jobs to harness the demographic dividend, and continuing efforts to address gender issues. The government’s natural disasters’ risk management framework is sound, but more can be done to mitigate the impact of food insecurity through broadened implementation of the 3N Initiative. Staff welcome the policies being contemplated for harnessing the demographic dividend, but this will require a more comprehensive strategy to create jobs as an increasing number of youth enters the job market. Recent policies for alleviating gender inequality are welcomed but public resources for girls’ education should be scaled up to discourage underage marriages, reduce birth rate, and improve future employment opportunities.  </P><P MCID="2">49.      Creating fiscal space and enhancing the efficiency of public spending are critical to enable Niger to achieve its development objectives. With security spending likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, it is important that such spending does not crowd out other development priorities such as investment in the social sectors, agriculture, mining, and infrastructure. Public expenditure efficiency and control are being enhanced and other specific measures will aim at improving public finance management in line with Fund technical assistance recommendations. Budget processes will be more closely aligned with the WAEMU guidelines. The necessary steps are already being taken to prepare the 2018 budget in line with the 2012 budget law that aims at longer term planning of spending so as to increase its efficiency. On the revenue front, resource revenues are only anticipated to rise over the medium term, so that greater efforts will be needed to mobilize domestic revenues, including through strengthened tax administration and broadening the tax base.  </P><P MCID="3">50.      Institutional capacity building will support the implementation of the authorities’ reform agenda. Progress has been achieved in enhancing government accountability and transparency in some areas such as recording of natural resource revenues and debt management. However, there is room for improvement in some areas such as assessing the efficiency of investments, tax and customs administration, liquidity management, financial sector development, and national accounting. Prioritization of social expenditures could also be enhanced. Efforts will be sustained to strengthen policy implementation capacity, including in debt and PPP assessment and management. </P><P MCID="4">51.      Deepening financial access will play an important role in making growth more inclusive. The government’s Financial Inclusion Strategy approved in 2015 and targeted at Nigeriens marginalized by banks appropriately identifies key reforms, but the focus needs to be stepped on implementation. Banking supervision should be strengthened in line with regional protocols, including as regards concluding the recapitalization of the two banks that do not meet some of the prudential criteria. </P></page>

Niger: Ex-Post Peer Reviewed Assessment1 </P><P MCID="1">Introduction </P><P MCID="2">1.      Over the last decade, two arrangements under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) supported Niger’s medium-term objectives of maintaining macroeconomic stability, promoting growth, and reducing poverty. The first three reviews under the first ECF arrangement (2008-11; SDR 23.03 million) were completed, but a military coup in early 2010 interrupted the policy dialogue with the Fund pending international recognition of the transitional government. The second ECF arrangement (2012-16, SDR 120.09 million) was approved in March 2012 and was initially scheduled through the first quarter of 2015. It was twice extended, first to end-December 2015, and then to end-December 2016, because of delays in implementing the structural reform program and larger BOP needs from security and humanitarian situation. The second extension was accompanied by an augmentation of access of 62.5 percent of quota. </P><P MCID="3">2.      This annex reviews progress during the 2012-16 ECF-supported program,2 and draws lessons for future program design and Fund engagement. The assessment is made from a staff perspective, and reflects the authorities’ views collected during the 2016 Article IV discussions and negotiations of a new program supported by the ECF.  </P><P MCID="4">Program Objectives </P><P MCID="5">3.      Niger’s development strategy under the ECF 2012-16—as laid out in the government’s Plan de Development Economique et Social (PDES)—envisaged leveraging its natural resource wealth into a sustained and inclusive growth process. Implementation of the strategy required large-scale investments in two natural resource projects, Imouraren (uranium mine) and the oil pipeline Niger-Chad-Cameroon, were scheduled to be completed during this period, but were delayed as the international market prices fell. Challenges under the program were numerous and diverse, but four stand out: (i) food security; (ii) security and governance; (iii) development of human capital; and (iv) infrastructure development.  </P><P MCID="6">4.      The main objectives of the 2012-16 program were maintaining macroeconomic stability, promoting growth, and reducing poverty. The 2012-16 program sought to consolidate the macroeconomic stability restored during the previous arrangement, while increasing Niger’s resilience to shocks, strengthening public finances and debt management, establishing a transparent </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="7">1 This note was prepared by Victor Davies and reviewed by Salifou Issoufou (Senegal team). </P><P MCID="8">2 The 2008-11 program was reviewed in SM/11/300. The following summarizes the key findings from that review: Macroeconomic performance under the 2008-11 program was satisfactory, although conditions deteriorated in 2009-10 following political instability and drought. The authorities maintained macro stability and average annual real GDP grew by 5.7 percent, above program projections. Both tax and non-tax revenues exceeded projections, thanks mainly to improvements in customs and revenue administration. Quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks were mostly met.  </P></page>

Fiscal policy aimed at supporting the growth strategy by creating fiscal space for increasing development spending, while preserving external debt sustainability. To that end, emphasis was placed on improving tax administration and expenditure control with the Fund technical assistance. </P><P MCID="1">Program Performance </P><P MCID="2">5.      Performance under the 2012-16 program was adversely impacted by a deterioration in security starting in 2012, a collapse of export prices starting in 2013, droughts, floods, and negative spillovers from the economic slowdown in neighboring Nigeria starting in 2015. Due to domestic policy slippages, fiscal performance fell short of program targets, and the implementation of the structural reform agenda was delayed. This, in turn, led to delays in completing several reviews. </P><P MCID="3"> Economic growth was generally lower than the initial projections. Average growth rate was 6.6 percent in 2012-16, compared with a projection of 8.2 percent. The economic growth under-performance was due to the above-mentioned external shocks, volatility in agricultural production which accounts for 35-40 percent of GDP, and delays in the implementation of the resource projects.  </P><P MCID="4"> Inflation in 2012-16 averaged 1.3 percent a year, well below the 3 percent WAEMU convergence criteria, in part due to the government’s timely food and price stabilization programs for the years when harvests were not good.  </P><P MCID="5"> The current account deficit averaged 15.7 percent of GDP in 2012-16, compared with a projection of 16.7 percent. International reserves were kept at comfortable levels in excess of 4 months of imports of goods and services. </P><P MCID="6"> The fiscal stance deteriorated as the budget deficits were higher than programmed. The overall balance averaged 5.5 percent of GDP over 2012-16 compared with projections of 4.5 percent, due to the exogenous shocks, repeated underperformance of revenue, shortfalls in external financing, and the failure to adjust spending in response to shocks. The deficits were financed by domestic arrears and external debt accumulation– with the external debt-to-GDP ratio rising from 21.3 to 34.1 percent of GDP between 2012 and 2016. Quantitative performance criteria on net domestic financing and net reduction in domestic arrears were missed for most of the reviews.  </P><P MCID="7">6.

Niger: Capacity Building </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">IMF capacity building efforts supported effectively the authorities’ macro-critical objectives. Technical assistance has focused on customs and tax administration and public financial management (PFM). Also, technical assistance aimed at enhancing capacity of the National Institute of Statistics and improve debt management for coverage and completeness. Fund technical assistance and training to Niger has however been moderate relative to the median for fragile states or LICs. IMF technical assistance increased significantly in 2012-13 (Figure), in support of the implementation of the 2009 WAEMU PFM directives, the taxation of natural resources, and the conduct of the 2012 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment.  </P><P MCID="3">Coordination with other capacity building providers was a critical part of Niger capacity building strategy. Under the 2012-15 PFM reform program, Niger received support from other technical assistance providers, namely the UNDP, the WB, the AfDB, and the EU. However, coordination has been weak in donors’ support for the introduction of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF and the investment budgeting in commitment authorization and payment credit).  </P><P MCID="4">Implementation of technical assistance recommendations has been slower than expected. Recommendations in the areas of revenue administration were implemented loosely, while treasury management reforms have repeatedly been postponed, especially those related to the Treasury Single Account (TSA), reflecting mainly low capacity and a lack of clear strategy. A project for a FAD long-term resident advisor is being set up—this expert will be tasked to speed up treasury management reform, in particular the TSA implementation.  </P><P MCID="5">Technical assistance should continue to be in line with macro-critical objectives, but be more demand-driven and reflect implementation capacity. To support capacity building, resident advisors in a few key PFM reform areas could assist in the coordination of technical assistance, the transfer of knowledge, and the ownership of reforms. Also donor coordination in the PFM reform area, through the use of a donor technical assistance coordination matrix, would be helpful. </P><P MCID="6">Niger: Evolution and Composition of IMF Technical Assistance by Department, 2009-16 </P><P MCID="7">(In person years of field delivery) </P><P MCID="8">Source: IMF. </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">  </P><P MCID="12"></P></page>

Over the past five years, the government of Niger has been implementing economic and social policies that have made it possible to maintain macroeconomic stability coupled with sustained growth in economic activity. These policies are based on the 2012-15 Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES), reflected in the 2012–16 economic and financial program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Program implementation was affected by government spending pressures driven partly by the impact of security and climatic shocks, a decline in trade flows with neighboring countries, and the price-depressed oil and mining sectors. The impact of these shocks undermined the achievement of the objectives of our development program. The ensuing fiscal deficits were financed largely by the accumulation of domestic payments arrears and the increased use of borrowing on the regional financial market. </P><P MCID="10">2.      The new economic and financial program (2017-20), which we are requesting, takes into account the achievements and lessons learned from the previous program to establish sustainable objectives. Its primary objective is the preservation of a sound macroeconomic framework, in particular through a prudent debt policy. The program also seeks to broaden the tax base, strengthen public financial and debt management, enhance the monitoring of developments in the natural resources sector, consolidate the financial sector, and improve the business environment. Given the severity of the exogenous shocks, special emphasis is placed on domestic revenue mobilization, the streamlining of spending, and diversification of the production base, with a view to increase the resilience of the economy and to create a sustainable basis for financing our development programs, while maintaining a sustainable debt level. </P><P MCID="11">3.      To achieve these objectives, we are determined to implement new reforms, while continuing those in progress. The new reforms will mainly aim at raising tax revenues and controlling spending, but also at facilitating the development objectives outlined in the 2016-19 Economic Policy Paper, which draws on the Renaissance Act II Program for 2016-19. Consequently, our actions will aim at strengthening the performance of the revenue agencies so as to increase revenues while controlling and improving the quality of public spending. </P></page>

Tax policy will also play an important role. Over the years, the advantages granted by our various codes (investment codes, mining code, and petroleum code) have steadily increased in terms of revenue opportunity costs. The same applies to our public enterprises, some of which are a source of revenues losses for the government. In order to increase revenue and better manage spending, the government is committed to rationalizing the tax exemptions policy currently in effect while also introducing bold reforms in the management of public enterprises by taking a closer look at the concessions granted. </P><P MCID="1">5.      Economic diversification will be stepped up. To that end we will pursue economic diversification policies conducive to a strong, inclusive growth and a more resilient economy capable of providing employment to a fast-growing youth population, thereby helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including through policies to reduce gender inequality and to reap the potential of the demographic dividend of Niger’s fast growing population. </P><P MCID="2">6.      The government remains firmly committed to pursuing a prudent debt policy that will enable the financing of investment plans while maintaining debt sustainability. The government will, therefore, limit loans contracted or guaranteed on non-concessional terms as prescribed in the Fund’s Debt Limits policy.  </P><P MCID="3">7.      In regard to the program objectives, we are convinced that the policies contained in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) should help achieve the program objectives. The government stands ready to take any additional measures that prove necessary to this end. The government will consult with Fund staff on the adoption of such measures, on its own initiative or at the request of the IMF Managing Director, before adopting such measures or before any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with Fund policies on such consultations. In particular, the government will discuss with Fund staff (including in the context of program reviews) any unforeseen circumstances that could affect the program, so as to conduct a joint analysis of their impact and identify appropriate actions to be taken without jeopardizing the achievement of program objectives. Lastly, the government is committed to provide the IMF with any information that may be necessary for monitoring the implementation of the measures and the achievement of program objectives, as agreed in the annexed Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).  </P><P MCID="4">8.      The government requests IMF support for its three-year economic and financial program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It is requesting financial assistance of SDR 98.7 million, equivalent to 75 percent of quota, and an initial disbursement of SDR 14.1 million (10.7 percent of quota) following approval of the arrangement by the Executive Board.  </P><P MCID="5">9.

Introduction </P><P MCID="5">1.      During the period from 2012 to 2016, the government of Niger implemented the economic and financial program supported by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Despite many shocks, this program helped maintain macroeconomic stability, made progress possible within the structural reforms and helped achieve the objectives in the 2012-15 Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES), thanks also to support from our economic and financial partners. To consolidate the positive results and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the government prepared a new economic and financial program for the period 2017-20. The program reflects the aspirations of the government’s Renaissance II Program for the period 2016-21 subject to new security, climatic, and economic environment constraints. The purpose of this program, for which we are requesting IMF support under a new ECF arrangement, is to lay the groundwork for faster poverty reduction by mobilizing more revenue from the non-natural resource sector and a rapid diversification of our economy to make it stronger and more resilient to shocks.  </P><P MCID="6">2.      This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes recent developments and the economic and structural policies. It presents the results of implementing the previous program, describes recent economic developments, the state of implementation of structural reforms, the short and medium-term economic outlook, and the macroeconomic policies, and structural reforms planned for the period 2017-20. The priorities and objectives of the program supported by the ECF are consistent with the thrust of the government’s Economic Policy Paper (EDD) for the period 2016-20 and the guidance note for preparing the Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy (SDDCI, Niger 2035). These priorities focus on: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving public financial management with the priority to increasing tax revenue by expanding the tax base and strengthening tax supervision, better controlling public expenditures, and strengthening cash management; (iii) improving debt management; (iv) increasing transparency in the management of the mining and oil sectors; and (v) supporting the development of the private and financial sectors.  </P><P MCID="7">  </P></page>

Results of Implementing the 2012-16 Extended Credit Facility </P><P MCID="1">3.      The performance of the program supported by the previous ECF arrangement were broadly not in line as expected. Therefore, following delays in completing some reviews, in part due of the impact of exogenous shocks, the three-year arrangement concluded in March 16, 2012, for a period of three years, was extended to 2016. Indeed, in recent years, Niger has undergone repeated terrorist attacks by the Boko-Haram group. While causing problems in production and slowdowns in border trade, these attacks resulted in additional military expenditures and humanitarian spending related to the massive inflows of refugees and displaced persons. </P><P MCID="2">4.      Moreover, the ongoing drop in uranium prices and the fall in international oil prices since end 2014 have impacted adversely program performance. The development strategy was based on windfalls from increase in exports of natural resources. But, the decline in exports of several products that are re-exported to Nigeria and fewer exports of traditional products due to the recent economic difficulties in Nigeria led to substantial revenue losses. These revenue losses due to these shocks affected budget execution and the achievement of some fiscal targets, in particular those related to domestic payment arrears and domestic financing. Therefore, various reviews’ conclusions required waivers, changes in performance criteria or extensions of the period covered by the program. Also, there were delays in implementing structural reforms, in particular the process of setting-up the Treasury Single Account (TSA). </P><P MCID="3">5.      However, results were encouraging. Niger was able to maintain macroeconomic stability, growth was sustained and inflation was contained. The coverage of foreign reserves remained at a satisfactory level and the program indicative target for poverty reduction spending was observed in some reviews. The incidence of poverty was continuously falling and estimated to 45.4 percent in 2014 versus 48.2 percent in 2011. Child mortality declined as well. Progress was also noted, though slow, in implementing the structural reforms, particularly with regards to the modernization of tax and customs administrations, the management of public expenditure, especially with the adoption of regulations required to implement the program budget, the framework for inclusive finance development, the supervision of the natural resources sectors, and the improvement of the business climate.  </P><P MCID="4">6.      But more efforts remain to be done. The different shocks pointed out the vulnerability of the economy. Budget deficits led to a rising debt, though the debt risk rating remains moderate. It has become critical to strengthen the economy’s resilience by diversifying the production base and to improve on fiscal management. It is also imperative to improve the mobilization of domestic revenue to reduce the dependence on natural resources. All of the above should go hand-in-hand with better management of public expenditure. Finally, despite the improved poverty situation, many MDG targets were not met, and the Human Development Index remains at a very low level.  </P><P MCID="5">  </P></page>

Recent Economic Trends </P><P MCID="1">7.      Growth increased in 2016 and inflation remained moderate. Agriculture production was up by nearly 8 percent, reflecting a good yield for irrigated crops. At the same time, the positive results expected from the 2016 raining season could trigger a rise in this growth rate. However, the recovery in the oil production was slower and government spending was constrained by low revenue. Thus, the growth rate is expected to rise from 3.5 percent in 2015 to 4.6 percent in 2016. At end-September, inflation was contained at an annual average of 1 percent, reflecting the good results of the last two crop seasons and the various measures taken by the government took to control price increases including the free distribution of food and the sale of grains at moderate prices. The average inflation rate for 2016 is expected to be around 1.1 percent. </P><P MCID="2">8.      Broad money in the nine months through September 2016 increased by 9 percent, which is in line with estimates of economic activity. Official net foreign assets decreased by  20 percent, as the external budget support envisaged for the second half of the year will only be disbursed at the end of the year. Credit to the private sector also increased by 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, a deceleration relative to the previous year. Credit to the government increased by FCFA 98 billion in the same period as the government turned to domestic financing in the absence of foreign support.  </P><P MCID="3">9.      The external accounts in 2016 were negatively affected by lower exports and re-exports. The deficit of the current account of the balance of payments, which amounted to 18.1 percent of GDP in 2015, should however decrease to 15.4 percent of GDP in 2016. This improvement reflects lower imports, which more than offset the drop in uranium exports, and the downturn in exports and re-exports to Nigeria, despite higher food imports due to the security shocks. Thus, the overall balance of the balance of payments is projected to be positive with a slight increase in international reserves of CFAF 40 billion in 2016. Niger’s external position would remain comfortable and covers 4.2 months of next year imports of goods and services. </P><P MCID="4">10.      Budget execution in 2016 was characterized by weak revenue mobilization. At end-June 2016, budget execution was lower than programmed, resulting into a basic deficit and a domestic financing below program targets. However, at end-September 2016, strong pressures on security and social spending led to a basic deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP higher than projected. The deficit was financed by more domestic resources (by 1 percent of GDP) a larger accumulation of domestic payment arrears (by 0.2 percent of GDP). The difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunications sectors and lower trade flows (exports and re-exports values were down by 30.1 percent) led to significant revenue losses. At end-September, the shortfall in revenue compared to the program amounted to CFAF 87 billion (2 percent of GDP), and revenue was down by CFAF 79.1 billion compared to 2015. The government responded to the revenue shock by freezing planned spending in accordance with the new mechanism put in place, through the Inter-Ministerial Budgetary Regulation Committee.  </P></page>

Tax revenue recorded significant shortfall. Tax revenue declined substantially at end-September 2016. The shortfall, valued at CFAF 11.9 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) at end-June 2016, reached CFAF 87 billion (2 percent of GDP) in end-September 2016. Revenue mobilization suffered from weakening economic activity in Niger and Nigeria, and from the depreciation of the Naira, which leads to considerable informal parallel market in oil products and drastic decline in exports and re-exports to Nigeria. In the Tax Administration (DGI), the shortfalls are explained by weaknesses in the collection of taxes on goods and services (CFAF 32.9 billion) due to low collection of VAT, mining royalty, superficial royalty, the domestic tax on petroleum products, excise taxes, and the income tax (CFAF 20.5 billion), due to low corporate income tax in nearly all sectors that are suffering from weak economic activities. The shortfall in the customs (DGD) (CFAF 26.2 billion) arises from the decline of VAT and other customs duties. Non-tax revenue was in line with projections. </P><P MCID="1">12.      Despite security pressures, spending was contained at end-June 2016. Current expenditures were lower than projected by CFAF 13.8 billion, with savings recorded in all spending categories except wages. Despite the streamlining measures, there was a CFAF 3.2 billion overrun in the wage bill, due to new hiring in the priority sectors, security and back pay. The streamlining measures that were taken included eliminating fictitious employees and dualism identified by the audit conducted by the High Authority to Combat Corruption and Similar Violations (HALCIA), streamlining back pay and stopping unsubstantiated payments of allowances (responsibility, family, desert area, etc.). Capital expenditures executed on domestic resources were also lower than projections by CFAF 13.4 billion.  </P><P MCID="2">13.      At end-September 2016, despite the strengthening of budget execution leading to an improvement in the government financing situation, there was spending pressures. During the first and second quarters, the government was able to contain spending to make less use of domestic financing and lower accumulation of domestic arrears. However, with the impact of pressures due to intensified terrorist attacks and social and humanitarian needs, the decrease in spending only partially offset the revenue shortfall. Thus, the level of domestic financing was higher by CFAF 35.3 billion at end-September. The government paid off the outstanding balance of arrears accumulated before end-2014 (CFAF 17.4 billion) that it was not possible to pay by end-2015 as required in the program, but it accumulated about CFAF 10 billion more in arrears. Budget support mobilization amounted to roughly CFAF 28.6 billion at end-September, CFAF 7.4 billion lower than projected. This amount includes grants of CFAF 17.6 billion from Saudi Arabia and CFAF 1.8 billion from Nigeria, as well as loans of CFAF 9.2 billion from the French Development Agency (AFD). Most of the scheduled financing will be disbursed in the last quarter of 2016. </P><P MCID="3">D. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks </P><P MCID="4">14.      The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to increase to 5.2 percent in 2017. Average growth over the 2017-20 period is expected to reach 5.9 percent, supported mainly by investments in the agriculture sector (increase in irrigated areas, upgraded crops, mini-dams, hydro-agricultural facilities, hydraulic structures, and increase in livestock), the start of other major road infrastructure projects, including the third bridge over the Niger River, the construction of the </P></page>

Niger is expected to benefit also from the gradual improvement of the economic situation in Nigeria. Inflation should remain contained below the WAEMU convergence criterion, at less than 3 percent annual average. The current account is projected to deteriorate slightly in 2017-19 and then improve gradually. The current account deficit would increase to 18.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and remain high until 2019 because exports would remain low in the absence of higher prices for uranium, oil, and gold. </P><P MCID="1">15.      However, this outlook is subject to various risks. While this outlook would benefit from expected more peaceful environment and socio-political stability, it remains subject to risks linked to climate shocks, shocks on crude oil export price and possible delays in the oil pipeline construction project, as well as deteriorating security tensions in the sub-region. </P><P MCID="2">E. Medium-Term Objectives and Policies </P><P MCID="3">16.      Government policies aim at maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieve the objectives of the Economic Development Document (EDD, 2016-20). Those objectives aim at fostering strong and inclusive economic growth that could create jobs and income and strengthen the foundations of sustainable development. They pertain to: (i) strengthening spending management and domestic revenue mobilization in order to make the financing of development projects secure and safeguard the viability of the debt position; (ii) sustaining investment as part of the 3N Initiative to increase and diversify agriculture production and make it resilient to natural disasters, while ensuring food security and promoting export development; (iii) investing in priority infrastructure such as energy and transportation in order to overcome our landlocked situation and improve competitiveness; (iv) diversifying production, mainly by enhancing the business environment; and (v) boosting technical skills as well as strengthening institutional and administrative capacities.  </P><P MCID="4">17.      The execution of realistic budgets will prevent the problems observed over the last years, characterized by the accumulation of arrears and resorting more to domestic financing. Spending will remain elevated in the medium term due to security and humanitarian needs. Because revenue is not expected to improve in the mining and oil sectors, the government will strengthen policies aimed at domestic revenue mobilization and improved budget management, based on the reforms from the 2017-19 fiscal management reform plan. Budgetary revenue must be based on realistic projections, with increases justified by well-defined tax measures or yields resulting from administrative reforms of revenue agencies. In the event of shocks, the government will have recourse to budgetary regulation and cash flow management mechanisms to meet budgetary targets. Owing to ongoing difficulties in the mining and oil sectors, budgetary revenue is expected to level from  15.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2019. However, as crude oil exports begin, a sizable increase in domestic revenue is expected starting in 2020 (19.1 percent of GDP).  </P></page>

The government is determined to continue streamlining spending launched in 2016 and would enhance further the effectiveness of investment. Therefore, current spending would stabilize at an average of 14 percent of GDP in the period 2017-20. By contrast, investment spending using domestic resources should rise from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to an average of 6.5 percent of GDP over the period 2017-20. Fiscal projections reflect the EDD’s development spending priorities, including security expenditures and those of the Plan to Support Persons Vulnerable to Disasters and Food and Nutritional Crises. After the basic deficit widened to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2017, it should decrease gradually to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2020. Over the same period, the overall balance, including grants, will decline from 7.4 to 2.9 percent of GDP, so that the WAEMU convergence criteria can be observed and financial viability can be safeguarded. The government’s financial position is expected to improve significantly thereafter. </P><P MCID="1">F. Program Performance in 2016 </P><P MCID="2">19.      All program performance criteria were met at end-June 2016, including the continuous performance criteria for non-accumulation of external arrears and nonrecourse to non-concessional external loans or guarantees, and the quantitative performance criteria on net domestic government financing, and net reductions in domestic arrears. However, the indicative target for domestic revenue was not achieved at end-June 2016. The indicative target for the basic balance was observed. Because spending was curtailed, it was impossible to fully meet the poverty reduction targets at end-June 2016. </P><P MCID="3">20.      Some of the structural benchmarks for the period under review were observed. The Directorate General of Budget (DGB) regularly produced quarterly budget execution reports and quarterly debt management reports were prepared and submitted to the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Monitoring Debt Policy and Negotiating Budgetary Aid. The level of payments by anticipation remained below the target of 5 percent, at 2.9 percent of spending authorized at end-March 2016, 2 percent at end-June, and 2.9 percent at end-September 2016. The government also prepared the borrowing plan for 2017-20.  </P><P MCID="4">21.      Some structural benchmarks were delayed. Measures planned under the implementation of the Treasury Single Account were delayed. In fact, the statutory framework for closing the government accounts to be consolidated in the TSA was not finalized as scheduled in late-June 2016, but the preparation of the required documents has advanced. The draft convention for managing the TSA has not been signed, but the comments from the BCEAO have already been incorporated, and the selection by the Procurement Directorate of banks to serve as government cashier offering banking services in areas not covered by the BCEAO is in progress. Although the terms of reference were drafted, the impact assessment study on commercial banks for transferring government accounts from the private banks to the TSA has not yet been started. The annual benchmark for preparing the procurement plan to be consistent with the commitment and cash plans was not observed due to weak capacity, but commitment and cash plans for the third and fourth quarters were elaborated.  </P></page>

In addition, the benchmark for end-2016 on the preparation of a biometric database for all civil servants with the support of the World Bank was delayed as well. The expert who was supposed to assist in this effort was hired on October 15, 2016 and began working in November by preparing a roadmap along with specifications for the consultants to be hired. </P><P MCID="1">23.      The reforms to modernize the customs (DGD) are ongoing. The migration to ASYCUDA World, effective since April 2016 for the first six interconnected offices (four in Niamey, one in Torody and one in Gaya), was expanded to all other fully operational offices, except for the offices in Agadez and Arlit, where there is no fiber optic coverage. Discussions are under way with SONITEL to cover localities that are not yet served. The offices covered by ASYCUDA World, which collect 90 to 95 percent of customs revenue, are now interconnected and electronic transit is operational. Customs also began transferring the management of bonded warehouses to the private sector, beginning with the transfer of the Niamey Rive Droite office to Bolloré in July 2016. The contract for transferring management of other warehouses to the Chamber of Commerce was also signed. Measures to speed up other reforms are being taken, in particular those that pertain to the tracking systems (a PPP contract was signed and the equipment was ordered), the interconnection with the customs systems of the region (Togo and Benin), and the implementation of the one-stop shop for customs clearance for vehicles. </P><P MCID="2">24.      Steps are taken to improve relations between tax administration and taxpayers and to improve revenues collection. The Arbitration Committee for Tax Appeals (CARFI) became operational in August 2016, following its launch on May 31, 2016. Communication with taxpayers is being strengthened, mainly by holding the Third National Taxpayer Day and publishing the newsletter entitled Le Fisc, which provides practical information on tax obligations. Also, measures are being taken to make operational the VAT credit reimbursement system in line with the May 6, 2016 order taken by the Minister of Finance. A “refundable VAT” escrow account was opened at the BCEAO, and funds should be added each month by withholding 5-10 percent of VAT revenue collected by the office of the large enterprises (DGE). On this basis, the DGI will review requests for reimbursement of VAT credit and design a reimbursement plan after consulting with creditors. Finally, the DGI is strengthening the audit of tax declarations in some sectors such as banking and telecommunications. </P><P MCID="3">25.      The General Directorate of Treasury and Public Accounting (DGTCP) continues to enhance measures for more efficient collection of non-tax revenue. The survey of non-tax revenue collection potentials has identified 134 niches, 37 of which were already established as collection agencies. The managers of these collection agencies were appointed, and with funding from the French cooperation, training on the legal framework, the operation and the auditing of the collection agencies will take place in November 2016. Tamper-proof booklets were made available, and this will increase the revenue collected by the police, gendarmes, and water and forests. Inspections of the revenue agencies were also strengthened. Finally, the DGTCP is strengthening the monitoring of domestic payments arrears and other outstanding due payments. In this regard, the second phase of the securitization operation of the 2014 arrears, which consisted in converting short-term securities with local banks in the amount of CFAF 38.8 billion into five-year Treasury </P></page>

Also, discussions with local banks to securitize a portion of the 2015 domestic payment arrears (CFAF 40 billion) are under way. </P><P MCID="1">26.      Public financial management reforms are continuing. The Government is pursuing the implementation of the terms of the 2009 WAEMU public financial management directives and the 2012 organic law on budget. In particular, are in progress preparations for introducing the program budget starting in 2018 in accordance with the roadmap prepared by the Directorate General of the Budget (DGB). The government is backed by the European Union to acquire the information technology hardware and software needed. Moreover, in April 2016, the National Assembly adopted the 2012, 2013 and 2014 budget review laws and the 2015 budget review law was submitted to the National Assembly for adoption. Finally, with a European Union financing, a review of government finances according to the new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology was carried out. The PEFA report, which was finalized in December 2016, serves as a basis for the ongoing development of a new public financial management reform strategy. </P><P MCID="2">27.      To break the vicious cycle of arrears accumulation, the government is strengthening the budget regulation and cash management framework. The government prepared realistic commitment and cash plans for third and fourth quarters of 2016. Also, the Inter-Ministerial Budget Regulation Committee was established by Order No. 0094/PM of the Prime Minister of June 15, 2016 backed by a Technical Committee for Budget Regulation and Cash Management. These committees are in charge of regulating the pace at which appropriations, commitments, and payment authorizations are released in a manner consistent with available cash and revenue projections, in line with government priorities.  </P><P MCID="3">G. Fiscal Policy for 2016 and 2017 </P><P MCID="4">Fiscal policy for the rest of 2016 </P><P MCID="5">28.      The government has taken steps to contain the basic deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2016. Based on the performance at end-September, the revenue level for 2016 was considerably reduced to CFAF 676.6 billion (15.3 percent of GDP). This corresponds to a decline of CFAF 92.1 billion compared to 2015 and CFAF 114.5 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) compared to the initial projections. Because of these revenue losses, the government held a Cabinet meeting bringing together all the ministers for a budgetary regulation, which resulted to the signing, on November 1, 2016, of an order to freeze budgetary credits amounting in a net CFAF 89.6 billion, including CFAF 48.2 billion in current expenditures. Thus, the basic deficit at end-2016 would deteriorate only by CFAF 24.3 billion  (0.6 percent of GDP), financed by an increase of domestic financing by CFAF 14.3 billion and an additional accumulation of domestic payment arrears of CFAF 10 billion.  </P><P MCID="6">29.      The arrears clearance program will continue in 2017. The program projected that the stock of domestic payment arrears accumulated in 2015 (CFAF 71.7 billion) should be cleared in 2016 through securitization with local banks (CFAF 40 billion) and by bond in the regional financial market. The securitization process was delayed, and the arrears will only be cleared in the first half of 2017. Consequently, the net reduction in domestic arrears at end-2016 is projected at about CFAF 8.4 billion.  </P></page>

The fiscal framework for 2017 takes into account the weak performance of domestic revenue and the necessity to meet priority spending. The fiscal framework for 2017 takes into account the poor revenue performance observed in 2015 and 2016, new expenses that cannot be compressed (security and humanitarian) and the priorities in the Economic Development Document (EDD). A 2017 draft budget law coherent with the macroeconomic framework was submitted to the National Assembly for adoption on November 4, 2016 (prior action).  </P><P MCID="2">31.      The agreed macroeconomic framework provides for a basic deficit of CFAF 235.9 billion (4.9 percent of GDP). This deficit level is consistent with debt sustainability. Domestic revenue is projected at CFAF 770.8 billion (16.1 percent of GDP) and domestically financed spending projected at CFAF 1,006.7 billion (21.1 percent of GDP). Thus total revenue would increase by 0.8 percent of GDP compared to 2016, with an increase in tax revenue that is 0.6 percent of GDP. Tax revenue would represent CFAF 721.3 billion (15.1 percent of GDP), an increase of 12.4 percent over 2016 (up  0.6 percent of GDP). This increase reflects the result of measures to strengthen tax and customs administrations, the revival of economic activities with a recovery in Nigeria and the unwavering fight against fraud:  </P><P MCID="3"> For the Directorate General of Customs, the requirement to certify value for the admissibility of customs declarations will help limit fraud, whereas the requirement for a Tax Identification Number (NIF) for all importers will limit fraud related to so-called occasional imports. The recent transfer of the management of bonded warehouses to the private sector would also reduce fraud and broaden the revenue base. Other activities are in progress: the start of the single automobile window (GUAN) with SONILOGA and the tracking system with GEOTRACK, combined with the interconnections with the customs in Benin and Togo. These measures would help limit revenue losses resulting from the misrepresentation of imported used cars as well as cargo losses.  </P><P MCID="4"> For the General Directorate of Tax: the finalization of measures to strengthen the reimbursement of VAT credit initiated in 2016, would allow the involved companies to apply the deduction system and strengthen VAT effectiveness.

In the event the revenue collected exceeds the projected amount, the government will discuss with the IMF staff the possibility to take into account the higher revenue into a revised budget. </P><P MCID="1">33.      Domestically financed spending is set to increase by 1.5 percentage of GDP. This level of increase reflects in large part interest charges and investment expenses in the priority sectors. Current expenditures are projected to increase by 0.2 percentage of GDP, to 14.6 percent of GDP compared to 2016, reflecting mostly the increase in interest on the domestic debt (0.1 percentage of GDP) issued in the regional financial market in recent years. Current primary expenditures are expected to stabilize with a 0.3 percent of GDP increase in spending on goods and services to take into account some items related to security spending. Wages and salaries are expected to decline by 0.3 percent following measures to control the wage bill. </P><P MCID="2">34.      There are other measures taken to further stabilize expenditures. These include curtailing the water and electricity supplies and telephone consumption, eliminating ghost workers, as well as unjustified allowances and streamlining the back pay that cost CFAF 9 billion at  end-October 2016. </P><P MCID="3">35.      Investment spending is expected to increase substantially. Domestically financed capital spending is projected at 6.5 percent of GDP. This represents an increase of 1.2 percent of GDP over 2016. This increase reflects current investments in the infrastructure and social sectors. Investments using external financing is projected to increase by 0.1 percent of GDP due to efforts to collect external resources and improve absorption capacity. The priorities are those reaffirmed in the new development strategy contained in the EDD, namely: (i) the security of goods and persons; (ii) urban, village and rural water systems; (iii) continuation of the 3N initiative and food security; (iv) infrastructure and energy; and (v) education and health. </P><P MCID="4">36.      The budget framework for 2017 is fully funded. The basic budget deficit (CFAF 235.9 billion) and the net decrease in arrears (CFAF 43.4 billion) projected in 2017 will be fully financed through budget support and the issuance of securities in the regional market. Budget support, projected to be CFAF 92.4 billion, includes grants from the European Union (CFAF 43.1 billion), France (CFAF 6.5 billion), and other donors (CFAF 5 billion) as well as concessional loans from the World Bank (CFAF 29.1 billion) and the African Development Bank (CFAF 8.7 billion). Net Treasury bond issuances would be limited to CFAF 116.7 billion and CFAF 40 billion in bonds will be issued with local banks to absorb the arrears from 2015. In addition, CFAF 60 billion resulting from the implementation of PPP contracts are included in non-banking domestic financing. IMF resources under the ECF should cover the residual financing gap. </P><P MCID="5">H. Medium-Term Tax Policy </P><P MCID="6">37.      The level of exemptions has increased significantly in recent years. The level of exemptions granted by the tax administration and customs climbed from CFAF 194 billion in 2012 to CFAF 300 billion in 2015, an increase of around 50 percent. While between 2012 and 2015, on average, a high level of CFAF 86 billion was observed at the DGI, their level has more than doubled at the customs, going from CFAF 85 billion to CFAF 222 billion, including exemptions granted in </P></page>

Also, with the advent of public-private partnership contracts, the scope of exemptions broadened markedly, leading to even higher revenue losses for the government. Moreover, although there has been considerable progress in monitoring exemptions, management of exemptions is still highly problematic: imputations and flows are difficult to trace. </P><P MCID="1">38.      Different frameworks regulate exemptions and beneficiaries are diverse, including public enterprises. The investment code is the most common framework. In addition, there are the 2006 mining code and the petroleum code, agreements signed by the government in the natural resources sector, and others such as those with NGOs. The various frameworks make it difficult to manage exemptions and makes the evaluation of tax expenditure and revenue losses more complex. Public enterprises are among the beneficiaries of tax advantages. In general, they are in sectors in which private initiative is still undeveloped given the absence of a competitive market. These enterprises are in the energy, water, and distribution sectors. </P><P MCID="2">39.      To broaden the tax base, the government is committed to reviewing the tax policy on exemptions. First the government is committed to take stock of the situation through an effective assessment of tax expenditures. The tax policy should be geared toward repatriating tax provisions in the sectoral codes in the General Tax Code and General Customs Code for better consistency and interpretation. For public enterprises, more transparent management is necessary, which would help improve liquidity management. The government is committed to improving the availability and quality of their financial information and their governance. In that context, the government is committed to conducting a full audit of the situation of some large public enterprises. To that end, it intends to request support from its partners.  </P><P MCID="3">40.      Other activities could be planned to strengthen the management of public enterprises. For 2017, the following activities will be carried out: </P><P MCID="4"> Prepare a list of all public enterprises by end-March 2017. </P><P MCID="5"> Evaluate the direct and indirect subsidies given to public enterprises by end-June 2017. </P><P MCID="6"> Prepare an action plan for the financial and operational audits of key public enterprises by  end-July 2017(structural benchmark). </P><P MCID="7"> Finalize the study on electricity pricing and proposals to the government by June 2017. </P><P MCID="8">I.

The government will take steps to strengthen governance and secure revenue. As tax payment in cash entails significant risk, the government agrees to take steps so that taxpayers can meet their obligations using more secure instruments, for instance through the banking system. Given the limited access to those instruments, the measure will be applied first to large taxpayers before being expanded gradually. The DGI will prepare a roadmap to extend the measure to the other taxpayers (February 2017).  </P><P MCID="2">42.      For customs, the reforms will aim at further strengthening the governance and control of customs operations, including:  </P><P MCID="3"> Reducing the time needed for customs tax operations clearance. The recent migration to ASYCUDA World and the ensuing expansion of the interconnection between the main customs posts would be helpful in that regard. The practice to delay the clearance of customs cases is incompatible with the functionality of ASYCUDA World and will therefore be outlawed as it may perpetuate dualism, IT procedures/manual procedures and the maintenance of various and sundry registers whose importance seems much less obvious. </P><P MCID="4"> Strengthening customs cooperation and regular information exchange between customs administrations in the sub-region. Given the delay in the interconnection between Nigerien customs and the partner ports, the customs administration agrees to conduct a monthly check of selected operations based on risk, using the possibility offered to it of obtaining customs information on goods headed to Niger under international customs cooperation arrangements. The DGD will take the steps necessary to operationalize the interconnections with Togo and Benin customs by end-July 2017 (structural benchmark). </P><P MCID="5"> The requirement for all importers to have a tax identification number (NIF). Some importers clear their merchandises through the occasional importer status. This minimizes their turnover, and thus limits the tax administration’s ability to manage them. The DGD will take measures to restrict occasional imports to importers who have no relationship to commercial or industrial activities (such as personal belongings). </P><P MCID="6">43.      Meanwhile customs administration will continue to implement its strategic reform plan, through the development of institutional and organizational capacities. Some of the reforms have already been initiated, in particular: (i) the revision of the General Customs Code, which is awaiting validation and adoption by the National Assembly; (ii) the drafting, now in progress, of a manual of procedures to be finalized after the adoption of the General Customs Code by parliament during its second regular session, scheduled from September to December 2017; (iii) the adoption in April 2016 of the draft law amending and supplementing the Law No. 2013-31 of July 4, 2013 on the Autonomous Status of Customs Employees; and (iv) the restructuring order, signed in August 2015, was revised after the new cabinet reshuffling. </P></page>

The upgrade of the information processing capacities will be sustained. The objective of the reforms is to speed up the implementation of an automated information system, in particular: (i) the implementation of the IT development plan, for which were already awarded the contracts for the interconnection and the acquisition of the systems (hardware and software) to be completed by end-March 2017; (ii) the interconnection of all customs units to the single server beginning July 2017; (iii) the extension of electronic customs transit to all main full-service customs posts by end-July 2017 (structural benchmark) once interconnection is completed; (iv) the full migration from ASYCUDA++ to ASYCUDA World is in progress and will be completed at end-December 2017 with the financial support of the World Bank to acquire software and with the technical support from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); and with hardware financing provided by the government of Niger through its computer royalty funds; and (v) the strengthening of the computer monitoring of exemption management and other economic regimes that contain exemptions from the government budget, offered by the migration to ASYCUDA World.  </P><P MCID="1">45.      The Directorate General of Customs will also continue its customs facilitation and anti-fraud program. The DGD plans to carry out the following measures: (i) resumption of the study on release with the support of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to reduce customs clearance delays; (ii) advance customs clearance of goods following the migration to ASYCUDA World; (iii) strengthening administrative assistance with Benin and Togo, through interconnection; (iv) adopting a risk-based approach in scheduling inspections and strengthening inspection teams, to be implemented by end-March 2017; (v) starting up operations of the single customs clearance window for vehicles (GUAN) starting in November 2016 in Niamey; (vi) better monitoring of cargo made possible by tracking system, in particular as part of operations of selling oil to prevent products intended for export from returning to the domestic market and to prevent fraud;  (vii) expanding the activities of Bolloré to the management of the Dosso’s bonded warehouses  and implementing the convention signed with the Chamber of Commerce for managing the other bonded warehouses starting January 2017; and (viii) improving the monitoring of re-exports to Nigeria by constructing a 49-hectare parking space in Maradi near the Nigeria border to accommodate all the trucks in transit. </P><P MCID="2">46.      The DGI will implement the following major reforms to quickly improve the collection of tax revenue: </P><P MCID="3"> Enhancing capacity-building through ongoing training of staff. </P><P MCID="4"> Strengthening territorial coverage by setting up tax services, mainly by establishing two new tax centers and two tax revenue facilities in Niamey by end-June 2017. </P><P MCID="5"> Expanding the authority of the DGE and to some extent the Directorate of the Medium-sized Enterprises (DME) to all businesses eligible for their control, regardless of where they are located in Niamey, by end-March 2017. It was found that the DGE manages only mining companies located in the interior of Niamey; all others, regardless of their size, except those covered by the Maradi office, are managed at the regional office level with limited capacities.

Those companies will be transferred to the DGE by end-January 2017 (structural benchmark). Subsequently, the other companies of the size of the companies managed at the DME level will be transferred to the DGE. The DGI will also transfer the management of NGOs to the DME from the DGE to ease its workload.  </P><P MCID="1"> Implementing the VAT credit refund mechanism. For a VAT payment system to run smoothly, a good framework is required to process applications for VAT refunds and to actually pay the refunds. Pursuant to the May 6, 2016 order of the Minister of Finance on the procedures for reimbursing VAT credits, an escrow account for reimbursing VAT credits was opened at the BCEAO, and it should be funded by withholding 5-10 percent of the VAT paid to the DGE. The DGI took steps to fund the account and to begin to clear the stock of VAT credits, estimated at CFAF 22.1 billion at end-October 2016. The stock of VAT credit at end-2016 will be prepared and the reimbursement mechanism of made operational by end-march 2017 by end-January 2017 (structural benchmark). Also, in consultation with the VAT creditor companies, a schedule for quarterly reimbursements will be prepared. </P><P MCID="2"> The implementation of SISIC (Computerized Tax and Taxpayer Monitoring System) will continue. In September 2015, the DGI hired a company to computerize its operations and develop the information system, and another company was hired in March 2016 to train staff in the use of the upcoming system. The DGI will also receive support from the World Bank through the Project to Support Competitiveness and Growth (PRAAC) to clean up the NIF file. </P><P MCID="3"> Revitalize the DGI-DGD inspection teams and decentralize tax auditing. </P><P MCID="4">47.      The DGI will also continue the reforms to simplify and adapt the tax law framework and expand the tax base. Several measures are under way, including: (i) full computerization of the services through the installation of the Computerized System for Monitoring Taxes and Taxpayers (SISIC); (ii) monitoring the activities of the Tax Appeal Arbitration Committee (CARFI), launched officially in May 2016 and made operational in August 2016; (iii) carrying out the study to strengthen the statistical framework and administrative circuit of the tax base; (iv) improving the taxpayer file and strengthening monitoring; (v) strengthening research and investigations and regularly updating the NIF; (vi) making more use of ASYCUDA World information on taxpayers imports; and (vii) publishing the results of the DGI/DGD joint control team. </P><P MCID="5">48.      The DGI will also accelerate organizational reforms. On April 29, 2015, the Minister of Finance issued an order (No. 0157) defining the organization scheme of the central and local DGI offices, and in November 2015, 117 staff were also assigned to the DGI. The reorganization will smooth the segmentation of the files processed by the various DGI services. The objective is to improve the targeting and monitoring of different categories of taxpayers, in accordance with the provisions establishing the thresholds for large, medium-sized, and small businesses, and the threshold at which payment of the VAT is required, established under the 2013 Budget Law.  </P></page>

The new organizational architecture is being implemented. The managers of the entities that were established have already been appointed. The improved management of the enterprises database is already starting to produce appreciable results, with a tangible decline in the default rate for all tax categories and a rise in the spontaneous tax declaration rate, in particular with regard to the VAT. The default rate in the DGE remains at about 2 percent, after declining from 17.5 percent in 2014 to 12.1 percent in 2015 in the DME. Nevertheless, despite these results, the rate of following up with taxpayers in default is still low, as well as yields from spontaneous reporting, since returns with payment amount to just 18 percent for the DGE and 4 percent for the DME. Thus, there is still room for improvement to further lower the default rate and control exemptions in order to raise the share of revenue from medium-sized enterprises in total DGI revenue. In order to do this, the DME will continue to improve the taxpayer file, strengthen the monitoring of taxpayers and send more reminders to taxpayers, in order to further reduce the average default rate to a standard of around 10 percent compared to 12 percent at end-2016 and 20 percent at end-2015. Inspections will be conducted to identify issues for significant default payments. </P><P MCID="1">50.      The government will continue to reorganize the tax audit processes and operations.  A new organization chart of the services has been put in place with the aim of making the various units more dynamic, in particular for those responsible for investigations, and establishing the principle of risk-based auditing. A joint customs and the tax administration team has been put in place, which has begun to audit 40 files, the results of which are expected very soon. The creation of regional investigation and research teams at eight (8) regional directorates will allow for better territorial coverage of audit activities. Tax audits will be gradually decentralized to management units, with the Directorate of Tax Audit (DCF) taking on a strategic management role going forward, establishing the risk areas and the timeline for audits. A pilot experiment initiated at the DME was conclusive, and it will be widely rolled out by end-December 2017. </P><P MCID="2">51.      Finally, we will strengthen the internal control and audit functions. The government is reinforcing staff resources to improve internal control and audit. The strengthening of the partnership between the DGTCP and Court of Auditors (with a view to better monitoring the activity of revenue collectors and to publish procedural manuals) should bring about a higher level of professionalism among the inspection units. With regard to internal audit, pilot projects aimed at improving the operational efficiency have been put in place at the DGE, Niamey 2 center, and Niamey 3 revenue office, which will be gradually extended to all DGI offices.  </P><P MCID="3">52.      The DGTCP will improve accounting procedures for better revenue collection. The DGTCP will regularly monitor the newly established revenue collection agencies in order to increase the collection of non-tax revenue for the government budget. The DGTCP will update dormant and/or inactive accounts and will accelerate prior actions for establishing the Treasury Single Account. The DGTCP will also strengthen activities for reducing the balance of the provisional accounts for budgetary operations, catch up on the delays in producing government annual financial statements (management accounts of the senior Treasury accounting officials) and monitor domestic payment arrears and outstanding balances. For 2017, the DGTCP intends to take the following actions: </P></page>

Budget execution regulation and cash management will be enhanced. To eliminate recurrent slippages in managing public spending and the accumulation of arrears, the budgetary regulation and cash management system was strengthened in June 2016 by establishing the Inter-Ministerial Budgetary Regulation Committee and the Technical Budgetary Regulation Committee and Monitoring of the Government Treasury. This arrangement is aimed to tackle the thorny matter of matching the immense spending needs with limited and often very uncertain resources. The goal is to provide the system with a sound decision-making base by establishing realistic commitment and cash plans that the different stakeholders involved in the execution of government spending would concur. The government will continue to ensure that the procurement plan is prepared in sufficient time for the budget to be put in place at the beginning of the year. The government will make the preparation of these plans systematic, as they are essential tools for regulating the expenditure chain. </P><P MCID="7">54.      This system will be strengthened with the availability of better information on the expenditure chain. From now on, an integrated table on the execution of budgetary expenditures will show in quantitative terms the movement of the credits voted by the Parliament, by nature, between the DGB and the DGTCP. It should ultimately ensure consistency and facilitate the reconciliation of the information produced by the two entities. The DGB will prepare this table in conjunction with the DGTCP. </P><P MCID="8">55.      The following measures will be implemented as a matter of priority in 2017. </P><P MCID="9"> Adopt the 2017 draft budget law in accordance with the budgetary program for 2017 described in paragraphs 30 and 31 (prior action).

The final reports will be produced by end-December 2017. </P><P MCID="5"> Identify procedures of paying wages through the financial system in agreement with the bank and microfinance institutions by end-June 2017. </P><P MCID="6">56.      The government will continue to implement the action plan for public financial management: </P><P MCID="7"> Continue implementing the 2009 WAEMU public financial management directives. In this context, the DGB has prepared a roadmap to implement the program budget that is expected to be implemented with the 2018 budget law. The preparatory stages for implementing the program budget include: (i) the preparation in 2017 of the 2018 budget in program format; and (ii) implementing the 2018 budget in program format. To this end, the Multiyear Budgetary and Economic Programming Paper (2018-20 DPBEP) (structural benchmark) will be prepared by end-May 2017 and submitted to the National Assembly by end-June 2017, supplemented by the Multiyear Expenditures Programming Papers (2018-20 DPPD) (structural benchmark). The other measures will follow as part of the new fiscal reform program. A dedicated unit for implementing the public finance reform was established in the DGB in December 2016. </P><P MCID="8"> Strengthen budgetary procedures in the public expenditure chain. Traditionally, the budget has been executed in a centralized system in which the Minister of Finance is the main payment authorization officer for the budget. Nonetheless, recently efforts to deconcentrate the budget have been made in many ministries and institutions, in line with the March 2012 organic law. Within this framework, the public expenditure chain was deployed in the main ministries that execute about 80 percent of public expenditures, thus helping to reduce spending delays and the to enhance budget deconcentration. Several regulations were enacted to allow the effective implementation of the organic law.  </P></page>

Quarterly budgetary execution reports will continue to be produced regularly (structural benchmark) as well as the implementation status of the pro-poor expenditures. Moreover, the budget review laws will continue to be produced on time so that they provide information on the implementation of the budget laws.  </P><P MCID="1"> Limit expenditures with no prior authorization to a maximum of 5 percent of total authorized expenditures (indicative target for each quarter).

It will continue to make every effort to ensure: (i) the implementation of the provisions for stopping commitments in relation with the complementary period; (ii) the shortening of the complementary period from three months to one, in line with the WAEMU directives; and (iii) the preparation by line ministries of procurement plans and flexible credit commitment plans so that the Ministry of Finance can prepare comprehensive procurement and commitment plans and a government cash plan in order to prevent the concentration of expenditures toward the end of the year.  </P><P MCID="3"> Control the wage bill and improve government human resources management will increase productivity. From 2010 to 2015, the number of civil servants rose from 48,237 to 75,597, for a 56.7 percent increase. This reflects the need to provide basic services for an ever-growing population. These enrollments were essentially allocated to the education, security and health services. However, the government is aware of the necessity to streamline hiring in the civil service in order to control the impact on the wage bill. </P><P MCID="4"> Implement a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The government is continuing to implement the TSA in accordance with the conceptual blueprint it adopted in September 2015 to establish the TSA by end-September 2016, but with some capacity constraints. In this regards, an IMF expert, using European Union funding, will be hired to support the unit in charge of implementing the TSA. </P><P MCID="5"> Computerize the expenditure chain. In implementing the WAEMU directives, the government initiated a program to adapt the computer systems for the budget preparation, management and execution as well as for the public accounting. In this respect, the government receives a technical assistance funded by the European Union to update or revamp the public finance computer system managed by the Financial Data Processing Directorate in the Ministry of Finance. In the first phase, this project foresees 8 major deliverables (in budget programming, sectoral program budgets, and public accounting). The budget execution aspects will be covered after a detailed analysis of the issue of deconcentrating authorization.

Recognizing the pace at which Niger’s public debt is increasing, the government is strengthening the institutional measures to its better management. Steps have been taken to improve coordination in the preparation of loan agreements to eliminate the risks of  over-indebtedness. In this case, the government put in place the institutional framework for implementing the June 18, 2015 decree on procedures for monitoring public debt policy and negotiating budgetary aid to strengthen procedures for managing the public debt, eliminate the risks of noncompliance with the criterion on new non-concessional loan agreements and contain the impact of new loans on the sustainability of the public debt. In accordance with the reform debt limits policy in the programs supported by the IMF, the government will update the medium-term external borrowing plan after the adoption of the action plan of the PDES 2017-21. This plan will include: (i) the investment strategy and a list of investment projects; (ii) sources of funding; (iii) uses of financing; and (iv) the debt management strategy, taking into account considerations of debt, fiscal, and external sustainability. Borrowing plans will continue to be prepared, in line with the national debt policy established with the technical assistance from the World Bank and the IMF.  </P><P MCID="2">58.      To preserve debt sustainability, the government is in the process of restructuring the debt stock portfolio. For monitoring the stock and debt flows, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Monitoring Debt Policy and Budgetary Support Negotiation will continue to express its opinion on all new loan agreements or guarantees by the government, including financing in the natural resources sector and all PPP agreements to ensure a detailed analysis of the sustainability of the public debt. The Committee's review of loan agreements and CPPPs is a prerequisite for the Council of Ministers to approve them. The government plans to continue to provide to the IMF staff a detailed quarterly reports on the outstanding public debt, new commitments and borrowing (including disbursements) and public debt service (structural measure).  </P><P MCID="3">59.      Rigorous actions will be undertaken to clear the stock of debt. The government is planning to restructure certain contracted debts that have not yet been used. This action will be based on the results of the AFRITAC West report showing that a significant stock of debt has been contracted, while the terms for its mobilization have not been met. Accordingly, the government is planning to review the US$1 billion loan contracted with the Export-Import Bank of China. The National Assembly approved this loan in June 2014. This line of credit is expected to finance major infrastructure projects and high-yield industrial projects. However, there are continuing delays in implementing the conditions for its entry into force. Steps have been taken to restructure the debt. Meanwhile, the government will present the procedures required for these restructuring by June 2017. </P><P MCID="4">60.      The government remains committed to conduct a prudent debt policy that will allow the financing of investment plans while ensuring debt sustainability. In this context, the government will continue to limit government guarantees and will carefully assess the impact of any new borrowing on debt sustainability. It intends to finance investment projects with concessional resources. Borrowing will continue to be limited to high-yield, properly evaluated projects. In the event that concessional resources will not be sufficient to finance the high-yield projects, the </P></page>

In this context, the government requested technical assistance from the IMF to strengthen the institutional framework that governs PPPs, while ensuring that this framework is consistent with the other laws and regulations, in particular the investment code. Meanwhile, the government will refrain from engaging into new PPPs that require fiscal contributions.  </P><P MCID="2">62.      The government is aware that debt obligations continue to grow very rapidly with significant borrowing costs. This pace of borrowing could pose major risks to the banking system, with the important current program for issuing Treasury bills and bonds.  </P><P MCID="3">Natural resources management </P><P MCID="4">63.      The implementation of measures aimed at expanding the export base for mining products and at strengthening the transparent management of the natural resources sector will continue. The policy of expanding the mining export base consists of encouraging operators to orient towards the exploration of mines other than oil and uranium. In this context, the government is in the process of granting exploration permits not only for the traditional uranium and oil sectors, but also for other materials such as coal, limestone, and gold; with the aim of both allowing for the diversification of partners in these sectors, and also promoting expansion of the country’s mineral export base. In order to secure signing bonus payments when mining permits are granted, all of the operators who wish to obtain a permit must now arrange a security deposit with a local bank. This security deposit, which covers a certain number of financial obligations, including the signing bonus, will be called as soon as the permit is published in the official journal.  </P><P MCID="5">64.      The government took steps to strengthen the contribution of the mining and oil sectors country’s development effort. Activity in the uranium sector continues to be depressed by low price levels. The principal mines of the AREVA group decided to maintain a low production level pending the implementation of the Imouraren Project that has been delayed until 2021, while one of the mining companies shut down production in 2015 pending decisions on the full liberation and increase of the company’s capital. New mining agreements based on the new mining code have been signed. However, due to low levels of uranium prices, the tax benefits of the new conventions will only be marginal. The government is benefitting from a technical assistance of France to strengthening capacities for evaluation, projection, and control of mining revenue.  </P><P MCID="6">65.      The government is now bolstering the means of regulation, negotiation and implementation of contracts. In this regard, steps were taken to ensure that the Inter-Ministerial Committee seeks to make the large projects efficient and to maximize competition. This is especially important since the contractual price of uranium, which will expire this year (2016), must be renegotiated. To better defend Niger’s interests in mining projects, the role of Société du Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN), which manages the public investment portfolio in the mining companies, is being strengthened, primarily with World Bank support through the Project to </P></page>

The government plans to strengthen the organization of gold production. In the last four years, there has been renewed interest in small-scale gold production, not only in the Liptako region in the southwest, but also in northern Niger. A governmental committee was set up to implement a system to supervise producers, collect information on the activities, provide better security, minimize the impact on the environment, and increase the sector’s contribution to government revenue. In April 2016, SOPAMIN transferred 75 percent of the capital of Société des Mines du Liptako (SML) to a private operator.  </P><P MCID="2">67.      The drop in oil prices and the impact of the depreciation of the CFAF against the dollar are affecting the oil industry. In particular, the cost of the inputs necessary for refining has risen significantly due to the sharp depreciation of the CFAF against the dollar and the relative decline in prices of crude oil and its derivatives in the international market. Moreover, the drop in export price is causing additional losses to SORAZ. This is why the government and partners in the sector have made regular price adjustments by lowering the selling price from CNPC to SORAZ: from US$70 per barrel to US$57 per barrel in March 2015, to US$50 per barrel in January 2015, to US$47 in January 2016, and finally to $US45 in July 2016. </P><P MCID="3">68.      In addition to the impact of low international prices, the oil industry continues to face technical constraints. In 2016, the Agadem-Zinder pipeline that supplied SORAZ was plugged, hindering SORAZ production for ten days. After the production resume, the level has reached 20,000-21,000 barrels per days since September 2016. In order to limit the degradation of the road network and secure the distribution of refined products, a project to build a pipeline to ship refined oil products to inland Niger and the Burkina Faso and Mali markets, will be implemented as a PPP, of BOOT type, with no government guarantee, at a cost of about US$800 million. The government has asked the private developer to conduct a feasibility study to better assess its impact on the profitability of companies in the sector. The government will share the results of the study with the IMF staff and keep them informed about the negotiation process. </P><P MCID="4">69.      Efforts to improve the management of the oil industry will continue. The technical committee in charge of looking into the current situation of the oil industry, in particular the impact of price developments in the international market has made proposals to the government. These proposals converge on a review of output prices at each stage of the industry to make the refinery more efficient while minimizing revenue losses for the government and keeping the pump price steady. The government also negotiated with CNPC the terms that govern exports of refined products. Thus, on May 11, 2016, the government decided: (i) to increase the SORAZ selling price to the government-owned distribution company, Société Nigérienne de Distribution des Produits Pétroliers (SONIDEP), for domestic consumption; and (ii) that SORAZ and SONIDEP would be authorized to export refined products jointly, equitably sharing the production on excess to local consumption needs, based on an export floor price set monthly. The 2008 Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) addendum taking into account these new terms, was signed on August 15, 2016, </P></page>

The government is also open to proposals from SORAZ for measures to lower the refinery’s costs.  </P><P MCID="1">70.      In view of the level of finalization of the negotiations for the construction of the oil pipeline, crude oil exports are only expected to begin in 2020. The discovery of additional oil reserves in the Agadem oil field, allowing for the production of 80,000 barrels per day, of which 60,000 barrels per day for export, over an estimated time horizon of 25 years. This has made crude oil export project viable for Niger. The studies performed by the Chinese partner, CNPC, led to the selection of a crude oil transport route via a pipeline running from Niger to connect to the existing Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The negotiations with Chad are expected to result in the establishment of NOTCO, responsible for the construction and management of the pipeline. The arrangements for Niger’s participation in the project are currently being worked out in accordance with the aim of ensuring the country’s external sustainability. Work could begin in 2017. Discussions are also under way with regard to the Chad Cameroon section of the pipeline. </P><P MCID="2">71.      The government is determined to continue strengthening the institutional framework and to ensure transparency in the energy and extractive industries. In April 2015, the government approved the electricity code that was adopted in May 2016 by the National Assembly. The code opens access to the power transmission grids. In September 2016 the government adopted the implementing regulations, including the decree on the attributions, organization, and functioning of the regulatory agency for the energy sector (ARSE) and the decree that establishes the requirements for third parties to access the power transmission grid. Projects to build solar power plants are now being financed through the French Development Agency, the EU, and India, which is expected to increase substantially the supply of electricity throughout Niger and ease supply problems from Nigeria that provide 65 percent of Niger’s consumption. With a capacity of 100 MW, the Gourou-Banda thermal power plant is expected to be up and running in early 2017. Tests are being performed on the four generators of this standby power plant. To increase the efficiency of the electricity sector, an audit of the national electricity company, NIGELEC, was conducted in 2015 with the assistance of the World Bank, and a study on the pricing mechanism will be finalized by June 2017. In 2011, Niger was declared “compliant country” under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The latest report on royalties and tax revenue generated by the extractive industries for fiscal year 2014 was published in 2016. The two ministries have mining and petroleum registries that are regularly updated and accessible to the public.  </P><P MCID="3">Financial sector </P><P MCID="4">72.      In spite of the progress that has been made in recent years, the development of the financial sector remains weak compared to other countries in the region. In 2015, the financial penetration calculated by the ratio of money supply to GDP is among the lowest in the world. It was 27 percent in 2015 compared to 37 percent for the average of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Overall, the banking sector is well capitalized, with 11 of Niger’s 12 banks fulfilling the minimum capital requirement. The Banking Commission placed the bank that failed to observe this criterion under close monitoring, with restriction on its credit operations until the recovery of outstanding loans, and an order to increase its capital. </P></page>

Implementation of the financial sector development strategy could strengthen the sector’s contribution to economic development. This is why the government is committed to pursuing the implementation of the strategy with the support from the technical and financial partners on priority interventions already identified. On the basis of the action plan defined in the 2014-19 financial sector development strategy document, in March 2016 the government established a steering committee in charge of the reform that will be extended to the various entities concerned (the Ministry of Finance, BCEAO, and the Professional Association of Banks, among others). The Committee is attached to the Ministry of Finance. </P><P MCID="1">74.      In July 2015, the government adopted the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (SNFI). This document represents an important step in the implementation of the financial inclusion policy and it could help consolidate the results of the 2012 National Strategy for the Microfinance Sector (SNMF). The overall cost for the five years (2016-20) implementation of the program is CFAF 34 billion, to be covered in part by donors. In terms of the potential beneficiaries, priority will be given to small economic operators who are currently excluded from the traditional banking system, in particular women, young people, and other poor classes that do not have access to basic financing to start up income-generating activities. </P><P MCID="2">75.      Finally, the government will continue its withdrawal from the banking system. The process of the government’s withdrawal from the capital of banks is ongoing. The West African Development Bank (BOAD) acquired 44 percent of BRS and the Raban Group (ORAGROUP) acquired 56 percent. The restructuring of BIA will be completed with the acquisition of the government shares by the Banque Centrale Populaire du Maroc (BCP). However, the takeover of the bank by the strategic shareholder was delayed by the negotiation under way with a one of the private minority shareholder. As for BAGRI (the agricultural bank), the temporary administration was lifted on April 1, 2014 after a period of nine months. A new board of directors was put into place and a new executive director was appointed. The government has made significant headway in its contacts with the BOAD and some domestic and foreign private investors regarding the transfer of the 65 percent stake that it holds in a portage operation. </P><P MCID="3">Business climate </P><P MCID="4">76.      The government is committed to promote the development of a vibrant private sector. The aim is to make the private sector the driver behind diversification of the economy and sustainable economic growth. The government is firmly committed to improving the business climate, which is a key to private sector development. To this end, the government created an institutional framework to facilitate the dialogue between the administration and the private sector. To this end, it created the National Private Investors Board (CNIP) under the authority of the Prime Minister, and the Permanent Consultative Committee (CPC) between the Ministry of Commerce and Private Sector Development and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Also, the government has created an institutional design to improve the business climate indicators that consists of a technical committee and thematic groups. Each one is in charge of improving a doing business indicator. Thanks to the reforms implemented in 2015 and 2016, Niger moved up 10 positions in the 2017 Doing Business ranking, going from 160th in 2016 to 150th out of 190 countries assessed.  </P></page>

The government is implementing measures to improve the business climate. Measures already taken include: (i) the opening of the Business Center—Maison de l’Entreprise— to make it easier to start a business and the implementation of an online governance system (e-Regulations); (ii) the reduction of procedures, time, and cost of business creation through the implementation of several reforms, including the decree of July 2014 establishing a standard model of corporate bylaws for limited liability companies (LLCs) and another decree of the same date on the implementation of the provisions of the Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law (OHADA) related to Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups; (iii) the adoption of the law regulating credit information bureaus (BICs) and set up Niger’s first BIC in March 2016; (iv) the facilitation of cross-border trade by signing two orders in December 2014. One for the documents required for import and export of goods, and the other for the public transportation of goods, the types of roadside inspections, checkpoints and redress mechanism to minimize abnormal practices in transportation of goods in Niger; and (v) the strengthening of the legal framework for settling commercial disputes through the creation and operationalization of the Niamey Commercial Court and the Niamey Mediation and Arbitration Center, led by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  </P><P MCID="1">78.      In this context, the government is continuing to put in place reforms aim at improving Niger’s ranking in the 10 “doing business” indicators. This is done in accordance with the action plan adopted by the CNIP to improve the business climate. For 2017, particular importance will be placed on the following activities: (i) the government domestic arrears payment program; (ii) the clearance of the stock of VAT credits and the improvement of the VAT credits reimbursement mechanism to avoid accumulating new credits; (iii) the access and pricing of electricity; (iv) the adoption by end-March 2017, with World Bank assistance, the implementing regulations for the law on land tenure to streamline the establishment of real estate titles and transfers of ownership; and (v) the study on para-fiscal and other taxes in the telecommunications and information and communication technologies sector in Niger, with the World Bank support. </P><P MCID="2">Demographic dividend and gender </P><P MCID="3">79.      Action was taken to maximize the demographic dividend of a rapidly growing young population. The government took steps to curtail early marriage by increasing the enrollment rate of girls and lengthening the number of years they attend school. In 2013, during a visit by officials from the United Nations, the World Bank, the AFDB, the AU and the AEC, the Head of State called for a coordinated solution to the demographic challenges in the Sahel. In response to this call, known as the “Niamey Appeal,” a regional project, “Sahel Women's Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD),” covering six countries (Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad), was set up with World Bank financing and UNFPA technical support. The prime minister launched the project in Niamey in November 2015. It aims to empower girls and women in decision-making (including through education), and to improve the demand for family planning and quality medical services for mothers and children.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Niamey, December 21, 2016 </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">1.      This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and indicative targets of Niger’s program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement for the period Q1-2017 to Q1-2020. The performance criteria and indicative targets for 2017 are set out in Table 3 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) attached to the Letter of Intent of December 2016. This technical memorandum of understanding also sets out data-reporting requirements for program monitoring.  </P><P MCID="5">Definitions </P><P MCID="6">2.      For the purposes of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of “government,” “debt,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:  </P><P MCID="7">a) Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger; it does not include any political subdivision, public entity, or central bank with separate legal personality.  </P><P MCID="8">b) As specified in paragraph 8 of the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements, adopted by the Decision No. 15688-(14/107) of the Executive Board of the IMF of December 5, 2014, debt will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a specific schedule; these payments will discharge the obligor of the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets, that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property , while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments necessary for the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. </P></page>

They include committed and authorized fiscal year expenditures that are not paid within 90 days. External payments arrears are payments due but not paid.  </P><P MCID="2">d) Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as such by the government (including any government debt).  </P><P MCID="3">A.

Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the government, including government securities issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not held by resident commercial banks, proceeds from the sale of government assets, and privatization receipts.  </P><P MCID="7">4.      Net bank credit to the government is equal to the balance of government claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash holdings of the Nigerien Treasury, secured obligations, deposits with the central bank, and deposits of the Treasury (including regional offices) with commercial banks. Government deposits with commercial banks are excluded from government claims insofar as they are used solely to finance externally financed capital expenditure.  </P><P MCID="8">5.      Government debt to the banking system includes assistance from the central bank (excluding net IMF financing under the ECF), the CFAF counterpart of the 2009 General SDR Allocation, assistance from commercial banks (including government securities held by the central bank and commercial banks) and deposits with the CCP (postal checking system).  </P><P MCID="9">6.      The scope of net bank credit to the government, as defined by the BCEAO, includes all central government administrations. Net bank credit to the government and the amount of Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market are calculated by the BCEAO.  </P><P MCID="10">7.      Net nonbank domestic financing includes: (i) the change in the stock of government securities (Treasury bills and bonds) issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not held by resident commercial banks; (ii) the change in the balance of Treasury correspondents’ deposit accounts; (iii) the change in the balance of various deposit accounts at the Treasury; and (iv) the change in the stock of claims on the government forgiven by the private sector. Net nonbank financing of the government is calculated by the Nigerien Treasury.  </P></page>

For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element (the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value) expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.

However, this performance criterion does not apply to financing provided by the IMF and to debt rescheduling in the form of new loans.  </P><P MCID="6">19.      For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in cash or kind).  </P><P MCID="7">20.      For the purposes of the relevant performance criterion, external debt is defined as debt denominated, or requiring repayment, in a currency other than the CFA franc.

In accordance with safeguards policy requirements for regional central banks, a quadrennial safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) was completed in December 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure its adequacy. </P><P MCID="15">Exchange Arrangement </P><P MCID="16">Niger is a member of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.

This assessment is unchanged from the previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted during the 2014 Article IV Consultation and updated during the sixth and seventh review of the 2012-16 ECF program. Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to shocks on exports stemming from fluctuations in commodity prices (oil and uranium) and severe drought. It is also vulnerable to a large reduction in combined FDI and project grants, and tightening of borrowing conditions. Niger’s overall public debt dynamic also highlights vulnerabilities, with the rapid increase in domestic debt and debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the benchmark under unchanged policies and larger deterioration of the fiscal balance due to significant loss in revenue or spending pressure. This result calls for continued efforts to improve debt management and macroeconomic policies to contain the recent increase in public debt while strengthening fiscal revenues and for infrastructure gaps to be filled through highly concessional funding and private sector involvement.  </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15">Approved By </P><P MCID="16">David Robinson and Peter Allum (IMF) </P><P MCID="17">Paloma Anos-Casero (IDA) </P><P MCID="18"></P><P MCID="19"></P><P MCID="20">Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary </P><P MCID="21">Fund</P><P MCID="22"> </P><P MCID="23">and the World Bank.</P><P MCID="24"> </P><P MCID="25"></P><P MCID="26"> </P><P MCID="27"></P><P MCID="28">December 22, 2016 </P></page>

It uses the standard debt dynamics template for low-income countries. The debt data cover external and domestic debt of the central government, debt of public enterprises and parastatals, state guarantees and private external debts. Domestic debt includes government arrears, debt to the regional central bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest-BCEAO) resulting from statutory advances, Niger’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation, government issued securities, and government public-private-partnership contracts (PPP) to finance capital projects.  </P><P MCID="3">Text Table 1.

Public external debt has since reached 30.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and is projected to reach 34 percent of GDP in 2016, partly due to government financing of public infrastructure. The composition of debt has also started to shift with the share of external debt declining slightly to 73 percent of total public debt in 2015, from about 76 percent in 2010, but with a significant increase in the share of obligations to multilateral creditors and a decline in the share of the government guarantee extended to the refinery.  </P><P MCID="1">3.      Large issuance of securities has increased public domestic debt which had declined in 2013 after arrears were cleared in the context of the previous ECF (Text Table 1). The domestic-debt-to-GDP ratio had declined from 7.4 percent in 2010 to 4.5 percent in 2013, but leapt to 11.5 percent in 2015 as the government issued CFAF 119.8 billion in regional bonds  (CFAF 18.2 billion taken by local banks) and CFAF 38.8 billion (entirely issued to local banks) to repay domestic arears.2 Consequently, the stock of government securities on the regional market has increased from 1.3 percent of GDP to 8.3 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2015. Domestic debt is expected to rise further over the medium-term reflecting the expected signing with domestic resident investors, of public-private-partnership contracts (PPP) amounting to around 6.5 percent of GDP mainly in the area of road construction to be implemented in the next 4 years.  </P><P MCID="2">4.      Debt management still faces low capacity, but efforts are being made to improve its framework. A June 18, 2015 Prime-Ministerial decree elevates the profile of the Inter-Ministerial Debt Management Committee, which is now chaired by the Prime Minister and also, oversees overall budget support. The committee is supported by a permanent secretary which ensures the coordination of debt management across ministries and that contracted debts are in line with fiscal and debt sustainability. In addition, a quarterly report on debt management is now regularly published, along with the three year borrowing plan that defines the debt strategy and identifies the investment projects and the sources of financing. </P><P MCID="3">5.

The medium-and long-term projections were updated to take into account recent developments.  In addition to the financing under the proposed successor ECF program, these developments include lower oil prices, the impact of the regional security situation, delays in the implementation of major natural resource projects, and the economic slowdown in Nigeria. The aforementioned shocks materialized during the current ECF (2012–16) program, and contributed to recurrent fiscal slippages. The proposed successor ECF 2017–19 program comes with a maximum access of 75 percent of quota. In the framework for the proposed program, the fiscal situation is expected to improve only gradually in the medium-term as, relative to the previous DSA, revenue projections have been revised down reflecting the delay in completing the large natural resource projects and with a slightly higher expenditure envelope (on top of the already anticipated elevated spending of 2016) to preserve room for development spending despite the anticipated continued elevated security spending (including assistance to refugees). The increase in resource revenue is projected only in 2020 because of delays in the implementation of the crude oil export project which is expected to be operational in 2020, while the completion date for the Imouraren uranium project is still kept at 2021. The basic fiscal balance will gradually improve during the course of the new program, turning to a surplus when revenue from crude oil exports becomes significant.3 </P><P MCID="4">7.      Growth and exports will be mainly affected by developments in the resource sector and spillovers from the economic downturn in Nigeria. The GDP growth path has been revised downward to reflect the slightly weaker than expected growth outcomes and the delay in implementing the resource projects; but longer-term growth is expected to be marginally higher once those projects come on stream. The DSA assumes a more conservative growth in export of goods and services compared to the previous DSA, reflecting the economic difficulties in Nigeria, Niger’s main regional trading partner; and low commodity prices that are adversely affecting the resources sector mainly uranium exports. This scenario results into a lower export-to-GDP ratio throughout the medium and long-term. However, public investment in agriculture and infrastructure are expected to help promote export-oriented growth and efficiency gains that could ultimately improve exports (Text Table 2). </P><P MCID="5">8.      Reliance on external grants and loans to finance the current account deficit is projected to decline gradually as natural resource revenues increase. Besides debt-creating flows and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the current account deficit is expected to be financed by substantial inflows of project grants and private capital. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">3 This expenditure rationalization objective will require stepping-up the implementation of the recommendations of the multiple technical assistance missions the country has benefitted recently including the completed 2016-public expenditure and financial assessment. The authorities have recently put in place a budget regulation committee under the aegis of the Prime minister to ensure spending is in line with revenue mobilization. Also the preparation of the implementation of the 2012 budget law is progressing with the 2018 budget law expected to be prepared in the form of program budgeting. The recruitment in the near future of a long-term technical assistant, will accelerate the implementation of Treasury single account that has been delayed due to lack of capacity. Finally, on the basis of the recommendation of the 2016-PEFA report, the government will elaborate a new medium-term public finance reform program supported by the donors to ensure budget execution is in line with best practices and compatible with the long-term fiscal sustainability objectives.  </P><P MCID="7"></P></page>

The macroeconomic outlook remains subject to numerous risks mostly tilted to the downside. The country remains vulnerable to the effects of exogenous shocks, including political tensions, fluctuations in commodity prices, and frequent weather-related shocks (drought and flooding) on economic activity and on food security. The continued low oil and uranium prices may cause further delays in implementing the natural resource projects. Also, the persistence or intensification of violent conflicts could divert resources from social needs and development projects.

In the baseline scenario, external debt ratios remain below their policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (2016−36). The present values (PV) of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios are expected to remain below the relevant thresholds over the medium term. Those ratios will slightly increase in the next 3 years, should the government borrow to finance its infrastructure investment plans. The debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios will decline starting 2020 when the export of crude oil is expected to start, boosting both exports and growth (Figure 1). However, further delay in the resource projects could lead the debt-to-exports ratio to breach the threshold putting significant pressures on debt and fiscal sustainability. As the baseline debt-to-exports ratio increases to less than 5 percent of breaching the threshold, the probability approach was applied, which highlighted all debt ratios remain well below their relevant thresholds during the entire projection period (Figure 3).  </P><P MCID="2">Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests </P><P MCID="3">12.      Under the most extreme shock scenarios, only the present values (PV) of debt-to-export ratio breach the relevant thresholds; the other debt ratios and the debt service ratios remain under their relevant thresholds (Figure 1). Under the historical scenario, which sets key macroeconomic parameters at their historical values, the debt ratios increase in the long term leading the debt-to-GDP ratio to breach the threshold in 2032 and the debt-to-export ratio to breach the threshold in 2028 and stays above the threshold. The stress tests’ results suggest: </P><P MCID="4"> The most extreme shock that affects the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio (Figure 1, Table 1b) is a 30 percent depreciation of the national currency in 2017.

In this case, the ratio breaches the threshold in 2017 and increases to a maximum of 230.5 in 2018 before starting to decline as crude oil exports boost aggregate exports. The debt-to-export ratio breaches also the threshold in case of:  (i) a shock on non-debt creating flows; (ii) a combined shock on growth and non-debt creating flows; and (iii) a tightening of new borrowing terms.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">5 The refinancing loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery (US$880 million), that was reflected in the previous DSA is not taken into account in this current DSA as negotiations have stalled over the last two years; the old debt is assumed to continue to be serviced normally. </P></page>

The scenarios simulate security and terms of trade shocks.7 In both scenarios, staff assume also a one-year delay of the crude oil export project completion. The simulation results show a significant macroeconomic impact, with GDP growth declining by 0.3 to 0.8 percentage points, and the current account widening by 0.8 to 1.7 percent of GDP, causing reserves to fall. The fiscal stance would also deteriorate as revenue would fall and security spending expand. From a DSA perspective, while under the security shock the debt ratios would remain under their respective thresholds, the large impact of the terms of trade shock on exports would cause the debt-to-export ratio to exceed the threshold by 15.4 percent in 2017 (Figure 4). </P><P MCID="2">PUBLIC DSA</P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Baseline </P><P MCID="5">14.      The baseline scenario assumes that the government will continue to rollover the outstanding stock of treasury bills, issuing on annual average CFAF 130 million in treasury bonds over the medium term and around CFAF 70 billion in the long-term, as revenue collection improves. Niger’s domestic debt, 11.5 percent of GDP in 2015, is projected to peak at 15.9 percent of GDP in 2018 as the government implements the 6.5 percent of GDP of PPP contracts. The 2016 budget includes a planned bond issuance of CFAF 170 billion of which CFAF 40 billion to be issued to local banks to repay domestic arears. However, due to delays in making the arrangement with the banks, the CFAF 40 billion security issuance will only be completed in 2017. The domestic public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall over the long-term, reaching 1.7 percent of GDP in 2036. However, this rapid buildup in domestic borrowing, expected to generate debt service equivalent to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2017, could engender significant risks to the government’s financial position if regional liquidity conditions deteriorate.  </P><P MCID="6">15.      The inclusion of Niger’s domestic public debt in the analysis highlights the vulnerability of the baseline scenario, as the public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the benchmark under the extreme shock scenario. Under the extreme shock with the primary balance set at the historical average minus one standard deviation in 2017-18, the public debt to GDP ratio will exceed the benchmark between 2018 and 2021 and decline in the long term. Also with an assumption of no improvement in the fiscal situation—the primary fiscal balance remaining at the 2016 level, a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP—public debt will rise continuously. Consequently, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed the benchmark in 2025 and reach 79.6 percent in 2036, significantly above the threshold of 56 percent of GDP (Figure 2, Table 2b).  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="7">6 The spike in debt service ratios in 2016 in the previous DSA was due to the SORAZ refinancing loan, which is now excluded for reasons provided in Footnote 5.  </P><P MCID="8">7 The security shock considers a security situation that generates 1 percent of GDP security spending and affects trade and some economic activities.

The current DSA includes identified private debt flows, linked to the large oil and uranium projects. It incorporates the contracts of a loan by the SORAZ refinery (60 percent privately owned), part of the FDI that will finance the Niamey-Cotonou railroad and the Imouraren uranium mine project. The stock of external private debt is estimated at 27.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and is projected to stabilize at just above 9 percent of GDP over the long run. This is lower than in the previous DSA, reflecting a downward revision in FDI due to persistent security challenges and lower commodity prices. </P><P MCID="4">CONCLUSION</P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">17.      Niger continues to be assessed as being at moderate risk of external debt distress —unchanged from the previous DSA conducted during the 2014 Article IV and updated during the sixth and seventh reviews of the ECF 2012-16 program. Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to shocks on exports stemming from the collapse of commodity prices (oil and uranium) and severe drought. It is also vulnerable to a large reduction in the combined FDI and donor project supports and tightening of borrowing conditions. Niger’s overall public debt dynamics also highlights vulnerabilities, with the rapid increase in domestic debt and total public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the benchmark under an assumption of unchanged policies and larger deterioration of the fiscal balance due to significant loss in revenue or spending pressures. In addition, further delay in the implementation of the resource projects could add significant pressures on debt and fiscal sustainability.  </P><P MCID="7">18.      Niger’s continued moderate risk of debt distress calls for the authorities’ sustained commitment to strengthen debt management and moderate the amount of new borrowing. The Inter-Ministerial Debt Committee should play an active role in strengthening institutional coordination and streamlining debt approval processes. In addition, the committee should continue to be actively involved in the evaluation of PPP contracts to ensure they are in line with procurement standards, the government borrowing plan, and debt sustainability. Staff advises the government to refrain from signing new PPP contracts until a new legal framework for PPP is established. Furthermore, staff recommends restricting external financing to grants and concessional borrowing. Also, staff encourages the authorities to review the debt portfolio on the basis of the Afritac-West technical assistance’s recommendations to address the large amount of debt signed but not yet disbursed including the Chinese master facility agreement signed in 2013. For the latter it is important to ensure that loans contracted under the facility finance self-sustaining development projects. The authorities are also encouraged to build buffers to cope with exogenous shocks, strengthen revenue administration, and prioritize spending needs. Finally, continued technical assistance in debt management is recommended to help build capacity in developing comprehensive borrowing plans on a regular basis, that are consistent with medium-term debt sustainability and aligned with development priorities.   </P><P MCID="8">19.      Finally, containing government’s borrowing to local banks could help to reinforce the stability of the banking system and limit crowding out of the private sector. Like in other WAEMU countries, banks’ exposure to government debt raises concern over systemic financial risks from sovereign default as fiscal positions become tight. Reducing government debt will reduce risks </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10"></P></page>

The Nigerien authorities welcomed the conclusions of the DSA that are broadly consistent with the previous DSA and also with their own assessment. The authorities reiterated their commitment to finance development projects primarily through grants and concessional loans. They also noted their intention to streamline the debt portfolio to ensure that contracted loans that have not been disbursed for many years are canceled to provide room for other priority projects. They also agreed to strengthen revenue mobilization and reinforce spending control to minimize the need for borrowing (including through bonds) to preserve fiscal sustainability. The authorities also noted the need to reinforce the debt management framework and to design a PPP framework that will minimize the budgetary risks from PPP implementation. </P><P MCID="2"> </P></page>

Niger: Baseline Scenario Assumptions </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2016−36 is based on the following assumptions: </P><P MCID="3"> Real GDP growth is projected to maintain 5.2 percent average growth over the medium-term, lower than assumed in the previous DSA, as the growth rebound expected from the resource sector is now expected only from 2020 due to the delays in completing the major uranium and crude oil projects. Consequently, average annual growth rate in the longer-run is higher at 5.4 percent. Continuation of steady agricultural production and of government food security program will help maintain inflation fairly stable at about 2 percent over the projection period in line with the WAEMU target. The export price for Niger’s crude oil is assumed to be on average 85 percent of the international oil price projected in the current World Economic Outlook.  </P><P MCID="4"> Total revenue-to-GDP ratio (excluding grants) will decline from about 18.1 percent in 2015 (including 1.2 percent of GDP of exceptional revenue) to 15.3 percent in 2016 as a consequence of weak commodity prices and the slowdown in the Nigerian economy. This ratio will rise to average 21.8 percent in 2036 about the same level assumed in the previous DSA, reflecting the improvements expected from the ongoing tax administration reforms and the expected revenue boost from the natural resource sector.  </P><P MCID="5"> Primary fiscal expenditure was 32.4 percent of GDP in 2015 driven by large spending needs for security, humanitarian assistance and health, education, and transport infrastructure priorities envisaged in the Plan de Developpement Economique et Social (PDES) 2012–15. Current expenditure is expected to decline gradually from 15.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 12 percent of GDP in 2036, while capital expenditure is expected to decline only gradually reflecting the large infrastructure needs of the country, and as a result, primary fiscal expenditure is projected at 24.1 percent of GDP in 2036. The basic balance (the fiscal balance net of grants and externally-financed capital expenditure) will gradually converge to zero and remain positive in the long run. The overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis excluding grants) will also decline from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 3 percent of GDP in 2036. </P><P MCID="6"> The non-interest current account deficit is projected to gradually decline to 10.4 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period, from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2015. Export volumes would increase, mainly driven by much larger export growth of crude oil and uranium (after oil production comes on stream in 2020 and the Imouraren mine in 2021). The exports volume of non-resource products is also expected to grow as a result of the expected impact of gradual economic diversification and implementation of the second phase of the 3N (Nigériens Nourissent les Nigériens) initiative. Imports of goods and services, representing 41.1 percent of GDP in 2015, would slowdown initially, in line with the decline of FDI-related imports, before stabilizing at 35.6 percent of GDP in 2036.  </P><P MCID="7"> Net FDI is projected to increase in the medium-term from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to above 10 percent of GDP in 2018-19 with the construction of the new oil pipeline. As assumed in the previous DSA, it is expected to decrease afterward as large investment projects come to completion, and earlier FDI loans are reimbursed. FDI is projected to average 7 percent of GDP in the long term. </P><P MCID="8"> The average interest rate on external debt is projected to be around 2.1 percent. The rate of external debt accumulation is expected to decrease after the major resources projects are completed and the Chinese master facility is fully disbursed by 2026. The concessionality of new borrowing will decline from an average of 33.5 percent in 2016 to about 30.2 percent in 2036 as the share of commercial loans increases gradually to 10 percent of total loans. The analysis assumes continued inflow of grants and loans of about on average 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The discount rate remains at 5 percent.  </P><P MCID="9"> The domestic debt profile assumes no net accumulation of domestic arrears and that securitized domestic arrears will be repaid over the next 5 years. The baseline includes an average bond issuance of about CFAF 90 billion a year after 2017 under the present terms of regional bonds for Niger (i.e., 6.3 percent interest rate, 5 years’ maturity and 1-year grace period) and 6.5 percent of GDP of PPP contracts to be implemented in the next four years starting 2017. </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11"> </P></page>

Fund program engagement has been instrumental in helping Niger to maintain macroeconomic stability and advance the authorities’ reform agenda amidst a challenging environment characterized by a succession of disruptive shocks, including security and climatic shocks, the fall in prices of oil and minerals, and a sharp drop in trade with neighboring countries. While delays in implementing some elements of the previous ECF arrangement were subsequently noted, major inroads were made in achieving the broad objectives of the Fund-supported program.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Recent Developments and Outlook </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">3. The recent period has been characterized by a benign macroeconomic environment challenged by exogenous shocks of different nature. Despite the authorities’ efforts in maintaining macroeconomic stability, the economy was adversely affected both by low international prices for uranium and petroleum products, by security issues and the economic downturn in Nigeria, the main trading partner. As a result, real GDP improved markedly in 2016 compared to the previous year although the pace of growth was slower-than-anticipated pace. Inflation remains subdued and well below the regional target. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">4. The fiscal stance in 2016 suffered from the revenue shortfalls induced by the difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunication sectors, lower trade flows with Nigeria, (exports and re-exports were down by 30.1 percent) as well as weakness in tax and customs administration.  The authorities responded to the revenue shock by freezing planned non-priority-expenditures while safeguarding salaries, debt service payments, and security spending. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">5. Our Nigerien authorities also implemented a number of structural reform measures. In the fiscal sector, they undertook important reforms to strengthen tax and customs administration.  A major step was made in terms of revenue mobilization, with the interconnection of the main customs offices which collect more than 90 percent of customs revenue. In public financial management, budget procedures were enhanced; exceptional spending procedures have been reduced significantly and “an Inter-Ministerial Budgetary Committee was established in 2016 to provide a mechanism to align expenditure commitments with resource availability and thereby reduce the incurrence of arrears.” A similar committee was created to oversee debt management and has been producing reports regularly. In the financial sector, a strategy has been adopted with an emphasis on financial inclusion for targeting populations with limited access to financial services. Progress was </P></page>

Our authorities concur with staff on the overall positive outlook despite challenges and risks. Growth is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2017, and to average 5.4 percent during 2017-19. The expansion of irrigated agriculture under the national food security program (3N Initiative) should be the main driver of growth. Security issues and persistent weak commodity prices are downside risks while a rebound in uranium and oil prices or a recovery in the Nigerian economy would boost Niger’s fiscal space and growth. The authorities are committed to conduct policies aimed at strengthening economic fundamentals and to continue their efforts of minimizing the impact of adverse developments. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Article IV Policy Consultation </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">7. Going forward, the authorities are determined to pursue steadfastly the reforms already initiated in the context of their new 2016-2019 development plan. The 2016 Article IV policy discussions provided a valuable opportunity for the authorities to discuss with Fund staff some of the key growth-promoting features of this plan, notably those aimed at increasing income-earning opportunities for women, mitigating the adverse impact of natural disasters, and reaping the potential demographic dividend.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">8. It is the authorities’ intention to continue to make progress in addressing gender inequality, notably by providing vocational education and finance to women with a view to making them become more economically active actors. The government will also scale up its investment in human capital with the aim at fully reaping the demographic dividend. In addition, the authorities’ efforts to strengthen their disaster risk management framework will greatly benefit from the useful recommendations formulated by staff in their well-written report and Selected Issues paper. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Policies and Reforms under the New ECF Arrangement </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">9. The new ECF-supported program (2017-20) seeks to maintain macroeconomic stability while creating fiscal space for infrastructure development, meeting the new elevated security risks, and for enhancing social spending. The program will build on progress achieved over the past period in many areas, including in budget management, debt management, customs and tax administrations and the business climate. For the period ahead, our authorities are committed to further making progress in enhancing macroeconomic management, bolstering structural reforms, accelerating diversification for enhancing economic resilience, improving social indicators and reducing poverty.

Fiscal policy will emphasize broadening the tax base to enhance revenue mobilization, in line with the overarching program objective of creating fiscal space for infrastructure and security and social spending. To this end, the authorities are committed to strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administrations, and improving tax collection, with the view to reducing dependence on volatile natural resource revenue. An increase in indirect tax revenues together with measures to improve governance in revenue generating agencies is expected to help boost revenue. Measures to modernize the customs administration and enhance transparency and governance include the finalization of the electronic inter-connection of all the customs offices; the deployment of ASYCUDA World Software to all main offices and the introduction of tax identification numbers for all importers.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">12. With Fund technical assistance, the tax base will also be broadened by including more enterprises into the large enterprises Directorate. In the same vein, tax exemptions will be streamlined through improved monitoring and control and aligned with best practices.  Overlapping fiscal advantages in sector-specific codes will also be brought into the customs and tax codes. A similar effort will be made to limit exemptions in the sector of SOEs; a thorough evaluation and an audit are planned to help clarify financial linkages of the state and SOEs to limit fiscal risks and reduce exemptions.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">13. On the expenditure side, outlays will reflect priorities in the EDD, notably public infrastructure, health and education.  Current primary expenditures are expected to stabilize while better control measures would help to reduce the wage bill by 0.3 percent owing to control measures. Other measures to contain spending, include curtailing the water, electricity and telephone consumption and eliminating ghost workers. Arrears clearance will also be continued. These efforts will make room for investment spending which is expected to increase substantially. Indeed, domestically financed capital spending is projected at 6.5 percent of GDP, which is 1.2 percent of GDP higher compared to 2016. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">14. The authorities remain committed to maintaining debt sustainability going forward. They will continue to strengthen the debt management framework and implement prudent debt management policies. In this connection, they are cognizant that their efforts to contain the fiscal deficit will be key.  On the basis of the fiscal measures being implemented, the deficit of the basic balance is projected at 4.9 percent of GDP in 2017. However, the authorities are confident that, with the major reforms they are undertaking, over the medium term the deficit will converge to the 3 percent of GDP convergence criterion.   </P><P MCID="11"> </P></page>

Though the overall financial system is still shallow, the banking system is well capitalized. The authorities are committed to implement both the National Financial Sector Development Strategy (NFSDS) and the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion. Under these strategies, “the government’s objective is to make available through 2021, CFAF 35 billion in credits to small businesses, in particular those run by women and young entrepreneurs.” Donor assistance will also be mobilized for this microfinance program at a forthcoming Round Table to be held in 2017. The government will also continue its divesture from the banking system. In this regard, discussions are underway with private entities interested in the government’s stakes that remain in banks.   </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Natural resource management </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">16. The authorities are committed to enhancing the management of natural resource endowments and bolster the contribution of the sector to the country’s overall development.  In this regard, efforts are being pursued in three directions. First, the government has strengthened the ties of investors with local banks to ensure that contract signing bonuses are paid when mining permits are granted. Second, the government is diversifying the mineral export base away from uranium and oil and investors as well. It is also taking steps to attract new investors and is in the process of granting exploration permits not only for the traditional uranium and oil but also for other minerals such as coal, limestone, and gold. Third, with technical assistance from France, the authorities are enhancing capacities for evaluation, projection, and control of mining revenue. In the same vein, the government is now revamping institutions for regulation, negotiation and implementation of contracts. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Business environment and economic diversification </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">17. Steady efforts have contributed to improve the business environment as evidenced by Niger’s moving from the 176th place in 2014 to 150th in the World Bank 2017 Doing Business report.   Achievements include the shortening of the time and procedures required to start a business, improved access to credit information with the establishment of a credit bureau, and the creation of a specialized commercial court which makes contracts enforcement easier. The authorities will continue their efforts to strengthen an enabling environment for business, with the aim of buttressing economic diversification. In this regard, their actions to further improve competitiveness, will encompass measures aimed at overcoming barriers identified in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">  </P></page>

Notwithstanding the variety of severe shocks that hit Niger in recent years, the authorities’ policy implementation has played a key role in maintaining macroeconomic stability. In this context, the predecessor ECF arrangement has helped the country cope successfully with the decline in international mineral prices, security challenges and the negative spillovers of the economic downturn in the main trading partner. These adverse developments are far from fading away and add to the structural bottlenecks facing the Nigerien economy, notably the infrastructure gap, narrow export base, gender inequality and high poverty. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">19. Against this backdrop, Fund continued engagement under the ECF will provide an appropriate anchor for the policies set forth in the government’s Economic Policy Paper for 2016-20. In this regard, the fiscal program aims to create the needed room for key infrastructure outlays and social spending. Moreover, implementation of the set of structural reforms envisaged in the program context will contribute to further improving macroeconomic stability and resilience and paving the way for economic diversification, sustained growth, and poverty reduction.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">20.
