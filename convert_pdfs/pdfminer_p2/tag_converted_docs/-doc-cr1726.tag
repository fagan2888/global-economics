The economy has weathered the global financial crisis (GFC) relatively well, and output surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2011. While growth has been slow in recent years, inequality and poverty are low, and living standards high.  </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">The economic recovery has strengthened in 2016. GDP growth in 2016 is estimated at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012–15. Growth has been broad-based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax cuts, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. Employment growth has picked up as well, and unemployment has stabilized at below 6 percent. At 1.5 percent y/y in November 2016, inflation is gradually picking up from low levels, driven mainly by rising energy prices and price hikes in tourism-related services. The outlook for 2017 appears similarly robust, while in the medium term growth would decline toward its potential rate, which IMF staff estimate at just above 1 percent. </P><P MCID="14">Risks to the outlook are mainly external, with </P><P MCID="15">limited likely impact overall.</P><P MCID="16"> </P><P Lang="en" MCID="17"> </P><P MCID="18">Executive Board Assessment </P><P MCID="19"> </P><P MCID="20">In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Austria, Executive Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows: </P><P MCID="21"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                              </Artifact><P MCID="22">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

<page id="2" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><P MCID="0">Austria benefits from high levels of stability and social cohesion. Per capita income is high, unemployment comparatively low (even though higher than previously), social protection systems are strong, and the society is among the most equitable of advanced economies.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">The overall outlook is solid, but potential growth is low. Growth picked up in 2016, but is projected to slow gradually toward the medium-term potential rate of just above 1 percent as the output gap closes and fiscal policy turns back to consolidation. Unemployment is set to remain elevated for some time as employment creation just keeps pace with the rising labor force, while inflation is projected to gradually rise to slightly above 2 percent in the medium term.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Risks arise from a number of external factors, but are overall limited. International political fragmentation or slow growth in other advanced economies and/or emerging markets would undermine Austria’s performance, largely through the trade and financial channels. However, with the European Single Market providing a stable economic framework and bank exposure to risks in CESEE declining, the overall vulnerability of the Austrian economy is limited.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Raising the economy’s potential is important to raise living standards further and lower unemployment, as well as to ease the fiscal burden of demographic change. A comprehensive reform package should focus on four key areas: (i) structural reforms to strengthen competition and further reduce firms’ administrative burden; (ii) raising public investment to support private sector productivity and investment; (iii) shifting the tax mix away from labor toward property, pollution, and consumption; and (iv) providing incentives for higher labor force participation among elderly workers, as well as for full-time employment of women. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Long-term fiscal sustainability requires additional reforms. While projections indicate a reduction of the fiscal deficit and debt in the medium term—largely on account of interest savings and restraint in government consumption—fiscal pressures will re-emerge over the longer term as the population ages, and debt will start to rise again. To ensure fiscal sustainability in such an environment, the current window of opportunity should be used to put in place efficiency-boosting expenditure reforms in health, education, and subsidies, as well as further pension reform measures. To be successful, many of these reforms require adjustments in fiscal relations between the federal and subnational governments. The potential for savings is significant, and, in combination with growth-raising reforms, sufficient to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Full implementation of these reforms would also allow reducing the labor tax wedge further. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Maintaining financial stability calls for ensuring that banks raise capital as planned and availing regulators with macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate market. Boosting banks’ capital buffers remains important, even though the low-growth, low-interest rate environment makes this challenging. The authorities’ introduction of a systemic risk capital buffer is welcome—they now need to ensure that banks will meet their capital </P></page>

This is all the more important as the environment for banking remains difficult both at home and abroad, and new challenges may arise. Financial stability risks from the real estate markets are currently limited; nonetheless, regulators should be given the legal authority to use macroprudential instruments at their discretion. To preserve Austria’s position as a financial center, the authorities will also need to bolster its AML/CFT framework, notably by enhancing supervision and banks’ compliance. </P></page>

To this end, a comprehensive package of structural a</P><P MCID="13">nd </P><P MCID="14">fiscal reforms can raise low </P><P MCID="15">GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt.</P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17">Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a </P><P MCID="18">challenging</P><P MCID="19"> </P><P MCID="20">environment. </P><P MCID="21"> </P><P MCID="22"> </P><P MCID="23">Outlook and risks: After a pick-up in 2016 supported by a tax cut-driven fiscal stimulus and a recovery in investment, growth is expected to gradually decline to potential. Inflation would gradually rise to above 2 percent in the medium term. Unemployment has stabilized, but remains high by Austrian standards (though low compared to other Euro Area countries). Risks arise from external factors such as international political fragmentation, slower global growth, and a possible rise in risk premia embedded in global interest rates.  </P><P MCID="24"> </P><P MCID="25">Raising GDP growth: Structural reforms to boost competition and reduce firms’ administrative burden, higher public investment, shifting the burden of taxation away from labor, and enabling higher labor force participation would raise GDP growth, support higher employment and living standards, and ease fiscal strains.  </P><P MCID="26"> </P><P MCID="27">Preserving fiscal sustainability: Public debt peaked at 85½ percent of GDP in 2015, and fiscal consolidation is underway after the stimulus in 2016. However, to meet ageing-related costs in the medium to long term, efficiency-boosting expenditure reforms in health, education, and subsidies, as well as further pension reform measures, need to be implemented. Many of these reforms require adjustments in fiscal relations between the federal and subnational governments to realize their full potential.  </P><P MCID="28"> </P><P MCID="29">Maintaining financial stability: The financial system is stable, but capital levels of large banks are still low relative to peers, and raising them should be a priority. At the same time, the low-interest rate environment, high bank costs, and legacies of heavy engagement in emerging Europe call for significant adjustments in the banks’ business models. Macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate market need to be made available to the regulators.  </P><P MCID="30"></P><P MCID="31"> </P><P MCID="32"> January 13, 2017 </P></page>

They agreed that deregulation of professional services and other heavily regulated professions could strengthen competition, but pointed out that some regulations were needed to ensure high quality standards. Staff agreed that quality and consumer protection should not be compromised and pointed to the experience of some Nordic countries and Switzerland that achieve high penetration and quality in professional services with less regulation.5 </P><P MCID="17"> The authorities agreed that public investment was important to support the economy. They were generally satisfied with Austria’s quality of public infrastructure, and thought that public investment should focus on R&amp;D, digitalization, and education.

They would prefer instead to rely on improved tax administration, where measures put in place in the course of 2016 should bear fruit in 2017, and on expenditure savings in the medium term. Staff encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts.  </P><P MCID="19"> On measures to raise labor force participation, the authorities agreed that improvements in provision of childcare, in particular the extension of kindergarten and school hours, would help. In this regard, they pointed to efforts underway to lengthen school hours, as well as to their recently legislated education/training guarantee for youth up to the age of 21. On pension system measures, views were split, with some satisfied with the effects of recently legislated reforms while others arguing for further measures before population ageing raised costs. Regarding integration of accepted asylum seekers, the authorities pointed to programs for language training and identification and recognition of skills, but noted that the asylum seekers’ uneven skills slowed them in finding employment.   </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="20">5 See </P><Span MCID="21">https://www.oecd.org/eco/reform/Sector-regulation-indicators.xlsx</Span><P MCID="22">. </P></page>

Growth and Female Labor Force Participation </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Raising female LFP can help cushion the impact of demographic change. Improving opportunities for full-time work for women and promoting employment for the elderly—both men and women—could have a significant effect on the labor supply. </P><P MCID="3">Background (Box Figure 1): The increase in employment over the past 20 years has been entirely in part-time employment, and mostly by women who have higher incidence of part-time work than in other OECD AEs. Concomitantly, the average number of hours worked has declined significantly. </P><P MCID="4">Causes: The relatively high incidence of part-time work by women may be due to personal or societal preferences (including caregiving for children or old people, which is cited by 38 percent of women as the main reason for working part-time).1 Limited availability of childcare also likely plays a role, since not all facilities (especially outside cities) offer full-time care.2 On the other hand, the share of children in childcare has increased significantly since 1995, and attendance is free or subsidized. The rapid increase in part-time work by men suggests that preferences in a rich society may shift toward a higher valuation of free time. With regard to low labor force participation of elderly workers, reasons include the relatively low retirement age for women (60 years, set to rise to 65 from 2024 to 2033), as well as options for early retirement for workers doing arduous work.  </P><P MCID="5">Impact: A high incidence of part-time work leads to lower pensions in an insurance-based system such as Austria’s. However, old-age poverty in Austria is overall low, supported by a means-tested minimum income for pensioners.3 Nonetheless, while the impact of part-time work on individuals is mitigated by the social security system, the cost in terms of public spending (and foregone social security contributions) can be significant. Indeed, Austria’s public expenditure on pensions is among the highest in the OECD. Lastly, the level of potential output is lower than if more part-time workers worked full time.  </P><P MCID="6">Policy measures: Reforms to the pension system have already been legislated (including an increase in the retirement age for women, and a tightening of eligibility for early retirement). Nonetheless, further reforms (though not gender-specific) will be required to contain rising pension costs. With regard to the high incidence of female part-time work, an increase in child care availability or long term care for the elderly could widen women’s choices and encourage some to work full time.  </P><P MCID="7">Simulation: If policy measures were to lead to a decline in female part-time work to a level in line with other OECD AEs (with male part-time work unchanged) and a corresponding increase in full-time employment, full-time equivalent employment in Austria would rise by 2.9 percent, ceteris paribus.4 An increase in overall LFP in the 55–64 age group to the OECD AE average (and employment of the additional workers) would increase employment by a further 3.5 percent.  </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">1 Only 11 percent of women and 16 percent of men work part-time involuntarily, well below the average of OECD AEs.  </P><P MCID="10">2 However, e.g., in Vienna, childcare facilities are open 11 hours or longer a day. </P><P MCID="11">3 The risk of poverty is, though, somewhat higher for women over 65 than for men (15 percent vs. 11 percent). </P><P MCID="12">4 Assuming that two part-time employees work as much as one full-time employee. </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15">Childcare provisionAgegroup199520140-24.623.83-570.692.06-97.016.5Source: Statistik Austria.Share in childcare</P></page>

The reduction to just above 100 percent of GDP in this round reflects: (i) the authorities’ updated long-term demographic projections, reflecting recent trends in the labor force; (ii) the debt agreement with the creditors of HETA, the wind-down unit of the former Hypo Alpe Adria bank (see Annex II), (iii) updated interest rate and inflation projections, reflecting the latest WEO projections, and (iv) a downwardly revised 2015 debt outcome.

Fiscal Federalism in Austria </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Fiscal federal relations involve tradeoffs between equity, autonomy, and efficiency. In Austria, the different levels of government (federal, state, and local) are closely interlinked financially, and the system is fairly complex and rigid. This leads to spending inefficiencies, as sub-national authorities have little incentive to economize. On the other hand, the degree of spatial equity is high.  </P><P MCID="3">Features:  </P><P MCID="4"> Size and complexity. States and local authorities play a considerable role in providing public services. Together, they are responsible for about 31 percent of total public spending. Transfers flow from the federation to states and municipalities, as well as from states to municipalities, and from them to states.  </P><P MCID="5"> Autonomy. The fiscal autonomy of subnational governments is very narrow. Most taxes are levied at the federal level and shared in specific proportions among the federation, states, and municipalities. Only a small amount of taxes is levied by states (5½ percent of their revenue) and municipalities (14 percent of revenue). Expenditure autonomy is also very limited, as a large share of transfers from higher-level governments are earmarked.  </P><P MCID="6"> Redistribution. Austria has a strong redistributive mechanism, with revenue being allocated to ensure a similar level of public service provision across the country. </P><P MCID="7">Implications:  </P><P MCID="8"> Efficiency. Limited revenue and spending autonomy demotivates efficiency, since more efficient provision of public services does not allow a reduction in taxation (and only to a limited extent a reallocation of funds for other purposes). This may go some way to explain why Austria has high spending on, e.g., health and education relative to the achieved results (see Country Paper 16/50).  </P><P MCID="9"> Equity. However, limiting revenue autonomy, as well as significant redistribution, may help limit regional economic disparities, while a lower degree of spending autonomy implies that public services are supplied to broadly the same standards.  </P><P MCID="10">Reform options: With strong centralized social security systems—which ensure a degree of equity across the population independent of states’ fiscal position—Austria is in a position to exploit the opportunities that greater fiscal autonomy offers. Higher revenue autonomy could lead to better use of efficient tax resources (e.g., property taxes, since these are locally determined). At the same time, most business and consumption taxes should continue to be set at the federal level to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor policies and economic distortions. Higher expenditure autonomy, accompanied by financial incentives such as sharing in the gain from reforms, benchmarking targets to best domestic and international practice, and rewards/penalties for under/overspending, would motivate the states to bring health and education spending per capita in line with other high-income federations without loss of quality (Box Figure 1). This need not come at the expense of equity; for example, neighboring Switzerland combines significant fiscal autonomy for its cantons, with a high degree of equity. The most recent agreement on fiscal equalization for 2017–22 takes some steps in this direction: the introduction of cost reduction paths, spending reviews and benchmarking aims at reducing healthcare spending while ensuring quality, while states gain autonomy over one, admittedly minor, tax.  </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Recent Dynamics of House Prices in Austria </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">House price growth has been strong in recent years by international comparisons. The cumulative increase in the house price index over 2007–2015 was nearly 40 percent. To a large extent, this increase was driven by price dynamics in Vienna. The OeNB residential price index indicator, which assesses whether prices move in line with fundamental factors, points to an overvaluation of property prices of about 22 percent for Vienna, while prices in the rest of the country appear broadly in line with fundamentals. </P><P MCID="3">Price increases in Vienna have moderated lately, while picking up in the rest of the country (Figure 3). In 2015, prices rose by 7.6 percent nationwide, of which 3.9 percent in Vienna and 9.6 percent in the rest of the country. As of June 2016, the year-on-year house price increase picked up to 9.5 percent, with 3.1 percent in Vienna and 12.8 percent elsewhere.  </P><P MCID="4">Factors underpinning recent housing price dynamics. Low interest rates over recent years have loosened credit constraints and increased households’ borrowing capacity, putting upward pressure on housing demand. That said, prices have been kept high by supply side constraints and other idiosyncratic factors, especially in Vienna.1 Reviewing and relaxing local planning systems and regulations to facilitate the supply response to price movement can help contain the price rises close to the long run trend.  </P><P MCID="5">Are the rising prices a problem? Financial stability risks seem contained. Nominal real estate loan growth is in the 5–6 percent range and their stock accounts for around 20 percent of total loans (Figure 3). As of mid-2016, the average loan-to-value ratio for mortgage loans is about 65 percent, and the household debt-to-income ratio is about 90 percent, low compared to peers. Nonetheless, the authorities need to have the legal authority to expand the macroprudential toolkit with real estate-specific instruments when needed, to limit any potential risks to banks’ portfolios if real estate price bubbles were to emerge. Moreover, the large share of new mortgages at variable interest rates (77 percent in 2016:Q1) raises concerns about debt service affordability if interest rates begin to rise.  </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">1 In Vienna, municipality-provided social housing (which can be rented only by eligible households) accounts for some 70 percent of total housing. Moreover, strong international demand for luxury housing is affecting price developments. </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10">-40-20020406080HPIESPCYPHRVNLDESTDNKGBRFINMLTBELDEUISLNORAUTSWEHouse PricesSource: Eurostat.Cumulativechange inhouseprice index 2007–15 (%)</P><P MCID="11">-20-15-10-50510152025Jan-07Jan-08Jan-09Jan-10Jan-11Jan-12Jan-13Jan-14Jan-15Jan-16House Price Index (Deviation from trend; percent)AustriaViennaSource: OeNB.</P><P MCID="12">-40-35-30-25-20-15-10-10-505101520Jan-07Jan-08Jan-09Jan-10Jan-11Jan-12Jan-13Jan-14Jan-15Jan-16Affordability (Deviation from trend; percent)Ability to repay loans (inverted; LHS)Overall affordability (inverted, RHS)Source: OeNB.</P></page>

External Sector Assessment </P><P MCID="1">External position. Austria’s external position has strengthened considerably in recent years, with the international investment position (IIP) moving from -13 percent of GDP in 2006 to a moderate +5½ percent in 2016. This turnaround stems from a combination of factors. While Austria’s share in world goods exports has declined, exports of services (mainly tourism) have expanded strongly, so that the overall exports of goods and services remained stable at 53–55 percent of GDP in 2010–16. On the other hand, the weak domestic demand during the global financial crisis and its aftermath has reduced imports somewhat (chart). Regarding financial flows, Austrian banks sharply reduced their reliance on foreign wholesale financing (and exposure to CESEEs), with the decline in foreign liabilities exceeding the decline in assets as deposits rebounded both at home and in CESEEs. This has led to a decline in banks’ gross external assets from a peak of well over 100 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 76 percent of GDP in 2016, still above the 1995 level of about 40 percent of GDP. However, Austria’s total gross external assets increased from 67 percent of GDP in 1995 to a peak of 273 percent in 2007, before receding more moderately to 255 percent in 2016.  </P><P MCID="2">Current account balance and real exchange rate. The External Balance Assessment suggests that the current account balance in 2016 (2.4 percent of GDP) was below the norm (estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP), while the REER was modestly overvalued (around 8¾–10½ percent), with both effects largely due to an unexplained residual.1 Policy gaps explain about one-third of the current account gap and REER overvaluation, with the main policy effects coming from high health </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="3">1The analysis is based on panel regressions of the current account balance and the real effective exchange rate (REER), which are simultaneously determined. The first stage is descriptive and focused on understanding current account and real exchange rate developments. The second stage is oriented toward a normative evaluation, drawing on the regression results to estimate equilibrium values for the current account balance and the REER, deviations (“gaps”) of actual current account balances and REER from these equilibrium values, as well as the contributions of “policy gaps” to the overall current account balance and REER gaps. </P><P MCID="4">External Balance Assement ResultsMethodologyTotal GapResidual(%)TotalFiscalHealthPrivateInterestCapital(%)BalanceExp.CreditRateControlsCurrent Account-0.9-0.30.7-1.00.1…-0.1-0.6REER (index) 1/8.72.4…2.4-0.30.3…6.3REER (level) 2/10.63.6…3.5-0.30.4…7.01/ Considers the REER CPI index in each country, and thus does not explain inter-country variations of the REER.2/ Takes into account differences in real exchange rates across countries by considering PPP real exchange rate.Policy Gaps (%)</P><P MCID="5">12131415163035404550552010201120122013201420152016Exports and imports (% GDP)Exports of goods (LHS)Exports of services (RHS)Source:Authorities' data and IMF staff estimates.Imports of goods and services (LHS)</P></page>

In the current account analysis, the low budget deficit relative to trading partners partially offsets the effect of the high health spending.  </P><P MCID="1">Capital and financial account. Net direct investment outflows to both CESEE countries and the EU15, have recovered quickly after the GFC driven by real-sector investment, keeping the FDI position in surplus. Net portfolio investment outflows have been strong as well and are expected to remain so, despite the further retrenching of Austrian banks’ foreign holdings, and the negative net portfolio investment position is expected to close gradually. This will be mirrored by a decline in the positive net “other investments” position.  </P><P MCID="2">Overall assessment. Austria’s external position is sustainable and broadly in line with fundamentals. The ageing population implies that a build-up of external assets in the next few years is warranted as a buffer for future withdrawals.

Debt Sustainability Analysis </P><P MCID="1">Austria’s debt outlook has improved. Public debt is sustainable within the medium-term projection horizon, though ageing cost pressures are looming in the longer term. Under the baseline, debt will fall from around 84 percent of GDP at end-2016 to 71 percent of GDP by end-2022. Standardized macro-fiscal stress tests indicate that lower growth and a combined macro-fiscal shock could shift the debt-to-GDP ratio upwards, even though debt would remain on a downward trajectory. However, in the longer term (starting in the mid-2020s), ageing cost pressures and higher interest rates would reverse the debt path without additional policy measures. </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Baseline </P><P MCID="4">Under the baseline, fiscal policy is set to return the structural deficit to ½ percent of GDP, Austria’s MTO, by 2020.1 This, as well as the positive effects of the deal with the creditors of HETA, the wind-down unit of the former Hypo Alpe Adria bank, would bring gross public debt to 71 percent of GDP by 2022, 13 percentage points down from its 2016 level.2 Gross financing needs are moderate in the period 2017–22. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">The heat map indicates that vulnerabilities have receded. The declining debt level implies that the impact of potential shocks would not push Austria’s debt—with the exception of a contingent liability shock—over the relevant thresholds. The high share of public debt held by non-residents, and the attendant external financing requirements, are a potential vulnerability, though this is limited by the perception of Austria as a safe-haven Euro Area country. However, it could lead to higher volatility in spreads, especially once the ECB’s asset purchases end, depending on interest rate dynamics outside Austria and residual risks from commercial banks’ CESEE exposure. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Stress Tests </P><P MCID="9">The low-growth scenario assumes that growth is reduced by one standard deviation of the historical outturn, implying a reduction of growth by 2 percentage point in 2017–18. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by close to 8 percentage points to a peak of 84½ percent of GDP in 2019 and then decline to 79 percent of GDP by 2022. An illustrative contingent liability shock of 10 percentage points of GDP would raise public debt to 97½ percent of GDP, which would only slowly decline to 93½ percent of GDP by 2022. The other standardized macro shocks––the primary balance shock, the real exchange rate shock, and the real interest rate shock––will not lead to significant deviations from the baseline debt path. A combined shock for all variables is driven by assumed lower growth and leads to a similar debt path as in the low-growth scenario. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="10">1 The structural balance excludes various one-offs, in particular bank restructuring cost. International experience suggests that the baseline scenario is realistic (see panel “Austria Public DSA – Realism of Baseline Assumptions”). </P><P MCID="11">2 The debt forecast for 2021 is lower than in the 2015 Article IV consultation by 4½ percentage points (ppts) of GDP on account of now-incorporated projections for HETA asset recovery (1.6 ppts), a 0.7 ppts better outturn of the debt ratio in 2015, and 2.1 ppts on account of a slightly higher nominal GDP and a lower deficit during 2015–21, resulting from a 2015 base effect (higher revenue and lower expenditure than expected that carry through the medium term) and lower projected real interest rates, reflecting updated nominal interest rate and inflation projections.  </P></page>
