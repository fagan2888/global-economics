The July failed coup attempt heightened the spectrum of political uncertainty, and Russian sanctions have also negatively affected confidence. Growth remains consumption-driven. Investment is weak amid heightened uncertainty and a sharp deceleration of credit growth. Inflation has moderated but is still well above target. The current account deficit remains sizeable, as the decline in tourism offsets savings from low energy prices. Progress on structural reforms has been slow. </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">Fiscal policy turned expansionary in 2016. Higher government spending is driven by an increase in the minimum wage and related subsidies, hiring in the education and health sectors, as well as higher security outlays. The government granted a number of temporary tax reductions/exemptions and expanded investment incentives during the second half of the year to revive growth.  </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15">The central bank of Turkey (CBRT) eased monetary conditions, by cutting the overnight lending rate by 250 basis points in the process of narrowing the interest rate corridor between March and September 2016. After a sharp depreciation of the Lira in November, the CBRT raised the repo rate to 8 percent and partly withdrew the liquidity provided to banks in the wake of the failed coup attempt. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="16">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Higher profits boosted capital adequacy, reflecting in part lower overnight borrowing costs and relaxation of prudential norms. Non-performing loans are increasing from a low level that partly reflects accommodating rules for loan restructuring. Credit growth slowed markedly in 2016, due to both demand and supply factors. Progress in strengthening the financial stability framework was assessed in detail during this Article IV consultation as part of the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which analyzes financial sector health and associated policies. The FSAP’s findings are summarized in the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA). </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Growth is projected to be below potential in 2016–17. The political focus on transitioning to a presidential system; renewed questions over the future of the EU-Turkey relations; and tense security situation in the South-East and conflicts in neighboring countries are expected to prolong the uncertainty, keeping domestic demand subdued. Fiscal stimulus and the expected completion of the gradual lifting of Russian sanctions are expected to support growth. Over the medium-term, growth is projected to firm around 3.5 percent. Inflation is expected to stay above target and the current account deficit to remain sizeable. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Executive Board Assessment2 </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Executive Directors welcomed the Turkish economy’s resilience in the face of severe and increasing challenges and the authorities’ efforts to avoid an excessive slowdown in the near term. At the same time, Directors cautioned that the economy faces considerable downside risks—with high inflation, external imbalances, and substantial reliance on external financing continuing to generate vulnerabilities—while dealing with complex geopolitical and security challenges. They underscored the overarching priority of rebalancing the economy through policies aimed at increasing domestic savings and raising potential growth, while ensuring strong and credible public institutions and policy frameworks that are clearly communicated. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Most Directors supported a near-term moderate fiscal expansion to address cyclical developments, given the current available fiscal space. However, Directors advised that a tighter fiscal stance is required in the medium term to reduce external imbalances and lower inflation. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal risk management framework, given that contingent liabilities are increasing, in particular due to a continued expansion in infrastructure-related PPPs.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Directors welcomed the authorities’ steps to simplify the monetary policy framework.

Directors emphasized that the authorities should remain vigilant and tighten monetary policy to address sharp lira depreciation, contain high and rising inflation, and counteract intensifying external pressures. Directors also recommended rebuilding international reserve buffers as conditions permit. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Directors welcomed that the banking sector remains well capitalized, and encouraged continued vigilance in light of a deterioration in asset quality. Directors cautioned that banks face substantially higher credit risks, and called for further strengthening of supervision and bank governance. Directors recommended that macroprudential policy should be strengthened, focusing on foreign exchange and other systemic risks, and not be used for demand management. They welcomed the FSAP’s findings and recommendations, and highlighted the desirability of further strengthening the independence of financial sector supervisory authorities, deepening and broadening the risk assessment nature of financial supervision and follow up, and strengthening the role of the Financial Stability Committee to support more effective systemic risk oversight and management.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify the pace of structural reforms to promote economic rebalancing and boost productivity. They welcomed progress made to reform the voluntary pension system, and urged continued efforts to increase domestic saving. Directors also underscored the importance of improving the investment climate and labor market competitiveness. They commended the authorities for hosting a large number of refugees and for their efforts to integrate them into the labor market, while stressing the importance of continued international assistance. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">  </P></page>

Growth is projected at 2.7 percent in 2016 and 2.9 percent in 2017 with considerable downward risks. Domestic consumption is the main growth driver, supported by a large increase in public expenditure and a hike in the minimum wage. However, political uncertainty, weakened corporate profitability, anemic credit growth, and a sharp fall in tourism have taken a toll on investment and net exports. The monetary stance and macro prudential measures were loosened, but credit growth continues to slow. A negative output gap is opening, but sticky expectations are keeping inflation above target. External imbalances persist: the current account deficit remains large and the NIIP is projected to become more negative. External financing conditions were favorable in the first semester, helping the rollover of large financing needs and supporting the Lira. However, political uncertainty after the failed coup attempt and a less favorable external environment are weakening the Lira and increasing the cost of external financing.    </P><P MCID="5">Policies: The overarching goals are twofold: (1) avoiding an excessive slowdown of the economy; and (2) addressing external imbalances and reducing inflation. In 2017, some discretionary fiscal measures should be used. In outer years, tightening is needed as external imbalances and inflation remain high. The authorities should continue simplifying the monetary framework, keeping a broadly neutral monetary policy stance. Monetary tightening could be required to limit excessive Lira volatility and its spillovers to inflation. The central bank should continue to accumulate foreign reserves to build buffers, against the backdrop of a choppier external environment. Macroprudential policies should focus squarely on ensuring the soundness of the financial system. Structural reforms should focus on increasing private domestic savings, improving the business climate, and reducing informality. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17"> December 20, 2016 </P></page>

Turkey has a dynamic economy, but needs to invigorate growth. Since the 2001 financial crisis, strengthened macroeconomic policies have dramatically improved socio-economic outcomes. Over the period, real per capita income increased by 50 percent, the incidence of poverty was more than halved, and life expectancy increased by 5 years. Enrolment and graduation rates increased significantly at all education levels, while gender gaps narrowed. The transformation into an industrial and service economy is ongoing, with agriculture still accounting for over one fifth of total employment. However, Turkey’s catch-up with advanced economies has slowed since 2008, and progress has increasingly diverged from the historic record of best performers. Moreover, growth has been unbalanced, as it has been accompanied by rising private sector and external indebtedness, leading to increased private balance-sheet stress. </P><P MCID="4">2.      Political and economic uncertainty have increased following the failed coup attempt in July 2016. Since then, a state of emergency has been imposed. More than 140,000 public employees, including one fifth of all judges and prosecutors and over one third of the staff of the banking supervisory agency (BRSA) and some economic ministries, have been suspended or dismissed. Around 40,000 people have been detained and over 4,000 companies and institutions with assets of close to US$4 billion have been shut, or taken over by the state. A referendum that would expand presidential powers is likely in 2017. </P><P MCID="5">RECENT ECONOMIC DEVE</P><P MCID="6">LOPMENTS</P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">3.      Following a strong performance in the preceding year, growth slowed in 2016. In the first half of 2016, GDP growth was 3.9 percent (year-on-year), but its quarter-on-quarter pace decelerated sharply, despite the easing of fiscal and monetary policies. Growth remains consumption-driven, reflecting the boost to real disposable incomes from the January minimum wage hike and low energy prices. Investment is weak, on the back of heightened uncertainty and a sharp deceleration of credit growth. The external sector subtracted from growth, due to the surge in real imports and fall in tourist arrivals.

Output contracted in the third quarter, but some pickup is expected by the year’s end. Security concerns and Russian sanctions cut the number of tourists from Europe by a quarter and from Russia by more than two-thirds in January-September. Also, the cereals harvest is estimated to be 9 percent lower than last year’s. The failed coup attempt and its aftermath have further disrupted economic activity. While the outlook for industrial production has recently improved, economic sentiment remains subdued amid heightened uncertainty. Government measures to spur consumption and investment and the gradual removal of Russian sanctions would contribute to the expected pickup of economic activity in the last quarter of 2016. </P><P MCID="1">5.       The unemployment rate has increased steadily since March, as the labor force grew faster than employment. The 30 percent minimum wage increase </P><P MCID="2">boosted average real hourly wages in the formal sector—by more than 10 percent in construction and services, and to a smaller extent in industry. The number of hours worked in the formal sector fell, while employment in the grey economy increased. At the same time, public employment in the education and health-care sectors grew strongly. Between May and July, seasonally-adjusted employment declined by 2.5 percent in industry and 5 percent in construction.  </P><P MCID="3">6.      Inflation has moderated but remains volatile and well above target. Inflation volatility is mainly driven by unprocessed food and energy prices. The latter reflect oil price changes, the September fuel tax hike and October cut in the administered price </P><P MCID="4">of gas, as well as exchange rate pass-through. The economic slowdown and REER appreciation dampened core inflation, though it remains elevated, reflecting unanchored expectations. </P><P MCID="5">7.      The central bank (CBRT) has eased monetary conditions in the process of simplifying the monetary framework. From March to end-September 2016, the CBRT gradually lowered the overnight lending rate by 250 basis points to 8¼ percent, leading to a commensurate decline in the interbank overnight lending rate.

Credit growth slowed markedly, due to both demand and supply factors. The large Lira depreciation in 2015 pushed private debt-to-GDP ratios to multi-year highs, limiting risk appetite (Box 2). The heightened political uncertainty also weighed on corporate investment. On the supply-side, macroprudential measures taken in previous years to rein in household loans proved effective, while banks maintained tight credit standards.

Through October, primary expenditures increased by 16.4 percent, on the back of new hires in the education and health sectors, inflation indexation, security spending, and the subsidy for the minimum wage increase. Interest payments decreased, as a result of falling interest rates. The increased spending was partially offset by higher tax and non-tax </P><P MCID="1">revenues. Following the failed coup attempt, the government announced a number of temporary tax reductions/exemptions partly offset by an increase in fuel excises. The current Medium Term Program (MTP) envisions a widening of the 2016 general government deficit by around 2 percent of GDP. The public debt is sustainable, but a combination of growth and contingent liability shocks would lead to a substantial increase in the public debt to GDP ratio (Annex IV.)  </P><P MCID="2">11.       The current account deficit remains sizeable at over 4.5 percent of GDP. The positive contribution from low world oil prices has been broadly offset by the weak tourism season and lower export prices. Non-oil real imports surged in 2016: H1, spurred by the pick-up in consumption and REER appreciation. Turkey’s external position remains weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The current account deficit is 1–4 percent higher than the estimated norm, implying a REER overvaluation of 5–15 percent on average in 2016 (Annex II). </P><P MCID="3">12.      Large external financing needs have been comfortably met, but costs have risen. Both the government and the private sector have so far refinanced maturing debt in international </P><P MCID="4">markets flush with global liquidity. As of 2016:Q3, the pace of external debt accumulation has slowed, reflecting the weakening economy and domestic credit, but also increased investor concerns. Sovereign rating downgrades contributed to a rise in the cost of external funding, with interest rates on syndicated loans increasing by 25-40 basis points. Portfolio inflows turned positive with a net inflow reaching US$8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, following a drought in 2015. The positive trend reversed in 2016:Q4, with non-resident withdrawals of US$2.5 billion by mid-November reflecting Moody’s cut of the sovereign rating to below-investment and the November emerging markets rout. </P><P MCID="5">13.      Turkey’s external debt is sustainable, but remains vulnerable to interest and exchange rate risks. Turkey’s external debt of around 60 percent of GDP is vulnerable to valuation shocks (Annex III). Debt service costs are sensitive to tightening of global liquidity conditions and changes in investor sentiment, given the still large share of short-term liabilities and loans with variable interest rates. </P><P MCID="6">14.

Growth is projected to be below potential in 2016–18. Domestic political turmoil, uncertain future of the EU-Turkey relations, tensions in the South-East regions, and military involvement in neighboring countries are expected to weigh in on domestic demand. However, population growth and rising wages will support consumption, while macroprudential loosening and fiscal incentives will benefit investment.2 Bank credit to the private sector is expected to remain subdued and, hence, not to be a significant factor in the growth recovery.3 Net exports are expected to improve somewhat, as a result of the Lira depreciation, the domestic demand retrenchment, and the expected lifting of Russian sanctions but security concerns are likely to hold back the full recovery in tourist arrivals. Uncertainty and changing global financing conditions are expected keep the cost of external borrowing elevated. As a result, short-term growth prospects have worsened considerably.

A possible further deterioration in geopolitical relations could undermine investor confidence. </P><P MCID="1">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="2">18.      The authorities believe growth will recover strongly in 2017. They attribute the economic slowing primarily to the drop in tourism, which shaved more than 1 percentage point off growth in 2016. However, thanks to a relaxation in macroprudential measures, a reduction in domestic interest rates, and investment stimulus packages, consumption and investment is expected to recover in 2017. Improved relations with Russia and growth in traditional trading partners will help the recovery of tourism and exports.

The overarching goals are: (1) avoiding an excessive slowdown of the economy; and (2) addressing external imbalances and reducing inflation. The growth slowdown and the Lira depreciation have put pressure on non-financial corporations and could ultimately generate risks for the financial sector. Avoiding an adverse loop between the slowing economy, large depreciation, and private balance sheets is the immediate goal. Addressing the external imbalances remains the main medium-term priority, requiring macro policies and structural reforms to increase private saving and reduce dependence on external financing. </P><P MCID="7">20.      These challenges call in the short run for a broadly neutral monetary stance—to the extent consistent with orderly FX market conditions—and a moderately looser fiscal stance. Monetary policy tightening could be required to prevent excessive Lira volatility in the short-run and contain its spillovers to inflation. Use of some fiscal space could help cushion the impact of negative shocks and possible tighter liquidity conditions on the economy.

Staff saw the current positive, real CBRT funds rate as balancing the need to contain imbalances and provide a backstop to the slowing economy. The monetary stance should be tightened if the recovery is stronger than expected and/or inflation fails to decline to its target. A tighter monetary stance could be also required to limit excessive Lira volatility and its inflationary spillovers. The enhanced provision of Lira liquidity after the failed coup attempt was appropriate, but this extra liquidity should be gradually withdrawn. </P><P MCID="2">23.      Staff recommended increasing international reserves. Staff welcomed the suspension of the regular foreign exchange auctions and reduced FX sales to state-owned enterprises. Conditional on global liquidity conditions being favorable, staff advised a further increase of net international reserves (NIR) through (partially) sterilized interventions communicated in advance to avoid market disruptions, and by increasing the credit limit facility for the EXIM Bank. NIR would need to be increased by about US$10 billion for GIR to reach 100 percent of the IMF’s ARA metric.  </P><P MCID="3">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="4">24.      The authorities re-affirmed their commitment to complete the simplification of the monetary policy framework. They saw the timing of further steps in the process as being dependent on inflation dynamics and external conditions. The authorities have also started a gradual withdrawal of the extraordinary provision of Lira liquidity against FX collateral in the aftermath of the failed coup attempt. While agreeing on the need to build reserves, they considered the current conditions unsupportive of a rapid accumulation. </P><P MCID="5">B.   Fiscal Policy </P><P MCID="6">25.      Moderate fiscal loosening in 2017 is appropriate, but a credible medium-term consolidation plan is needed. The projected widening of the general government structural primary balance by ½ percent of GDP in 2017 would support domestic demand, without exacerbating external imbalances. Staff urged authorities to let automatic stabilizers work and argued that an extension of the minimum wage subsidy at an appropriately lower level could be an effective means of supporting growth and employment. Staff welcomed the planned increase in public investment. However, staff cautioned that the announced investment incentives may not be effective to achieve the desired effect, given the high level of uncertainty and elevated private debt burden (Box 2). Tax incentives would have to be well-targeted and supported by macroeconomic stability and rule of law to be effective. While broadly supportive of the authorities’ 2017 expenditure plan, staff considers the authorities’ 2017 revenue projections to be overly optimistic, with the tax-to-GDP ratio projected to increase by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2017. Tax expenditures remain an issue and revisions suggest they are in fact over 3 percent of GDP higher than previously estimated. For 2018-19, the planned reduction of current transfers by 1 percent of GDP in 2018–19 is appropriate, but needs to be backed by specific measures to contain the wage bill, pension and health care spending and limit the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term. </P></page>

Turkey has some fiscal space to provide the recommended temporary stimulus, Access </P><P MCID="1">to financing remains solid, despite some increase in costs. The fiscal position is sound: the debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate and is projected to eventually resume its declining trend under the baseline and most stress scenarios; gross financing needs are low, and projected primary balances exceed the debt-stabilizing level over the medium term (Annex IV). However, persistent external imbalances, and dependency of the banking and corporate sectors on external markets with substantial rollover needs, call for prudence in using the fiscal space.  </P><P MCID="2">27.      Enhanced management of fiscal risks is warranted. Contingent liabilities are increasing, due to continued reliance on PPPs for infrastructure investment. At the same time, the legal and oversight framework for PPPs is fragmented. A growing share of fiscal risks falls outside the Treasury’s established approval and monitoring system and is not public (Box 4). Staff urged stronger central oversight, approval, and disclosure procedures for all public guarantees, backed by a comprehensive PPP framework law. Staff viewed the newly announced investment incentives as adding to existing fiscal risks, as in some cases they would involve the extension of purchase and other guarantees. 6 The recently established sovereign wealth fund, to be funded by privatization receipts and possible capital market financing, carries added potential for fiscal and financial risks. Staff therefore recommended that the governance of the fund should be aligned with international best practices, including published annual reports, audited financial statements, and a transparent investment policy. Staff reiterated its recommendation to publish an explicit fiscal risk statement.  </P><P MCID="3">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="4">28.      The authorities believe that their policies appropriately address the need to stimulate the economy while remaining fiscally responsible. They emphasized the relatively low level of public debt and its composition as strengths, and reiterated their intention to maintain fiscal discipline. The central government overall deficit is envisioned to remain below 2 percent of GDP throughout the MTP horizon, which would ensure a declining trend in public debt. They believed that the new incentive schemes would boost investment as they offer a wide spectrum of benefits to the potential investors in a flexible manner.  </P><P MCID="5">29.

The share of non-performing loans has increased in consumer and more recently corporate loans. Restructuring of credits to sectors hit hardest by the economic slowdown masks the extent of asset quality impairment. Drawing upon the findings of the recent FSAP assessment (Box 5), staff urged authorities to evaluate and revise the definition of credit classifications to bring them more in line with international norms and strengthen enforcement, and to strengthen the supervisory processes and banks’ governance standards. </P><P MCID="1">31.      Staff questioned the rationale behind the recent loosening of macroprudential regulations for consumer loans. Macroprudential policies should focus squarely on ensuring the soundness of the financial system—not on active domestic demand management. Staff argued that the macroprudential loosening risks being counterproductive in the context of high private indebtedness. Even if it is temporarily successful in spurring demand, it adds to existing financial vulnerabilities that policies would need to address in the future. </P><P MCID="2">32.      Staff argued that the macroprudential regime for corporate FX borrowing should aim at lowering the foreign exchange risk in the economy. Specific measures in this area, drawn from the recent FSAP assessment, are manifold: (i) quicker phase-in of reserve requirement measures aimed at lengthening the maturity of banks’ external financing as well as the net stable funding ratio; (ii) increasing the remuneration differential between Lira and FX reserves to further slow banks’ FX wholesale borrowing; (iii) increasing capital charges and/or provisioning on FX loans aimed at internalizing the increased indirect credit risk associated with FX lending; (iv) bringing the prudential treatment of FX-indexed lending in line with that of FX lending; and (v) introducing tax measures to discourage NFCs from borrowing in FX, both domestically and externally. </P><P MCID="3">33.

The authorities see the loosening of macroprudential measures for consumer lending as stabilizing domestic demand and thereby lowering financial sector risks.

The authorities should require prompt recapitalization if stress tests show a capital shortfall. </P><P MCID="1">36.      In case of large capital outflows—or, in extremis, a sudden stop—a tighter monetary stance would be unavoidable. In disorderly market conditions, banks and corporates would have difficulties rolling over external debt, and the renewal of FX hedges could become prohibitively expensive. Banks would likely react by not rolling over corporates’ domestic FX loans, precisely at the time when corporates would be under strain to repay them. In such a scenario, a recession would be likely, and the Lira would be under pressure. Under such circumstances, staff argued that the policy rate would need to be increased sharply to avoid a more damaging and disruptive depreciation. Given that net international reserves are low, the scope for credible FX intervention is limited. In the event of a recession, fiscal policy should be loosened, as public debt sustainability is not an immediate concern. Still, corporate default and bank liquidity or solvency problems could occur. In this regard, staff reiterated the recommendation to strengthen supervisory processes and banks’ governance standards and emphasized the importance of putting in place of a robust debt-restructuring framework. </P><P MCID="2">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="3">37.

Staff reiterated the importance of reforming and pre-funding the severance pay system—which currently covers only part of formal employment and is overly burdensome for enterprises—for enhancing labor mobility. In addition, staff argued that extension of the minimum wage subsidy at an appropriately lower level would provide relief to strained firms in the formal sector.

Staff welcomed the new pension auto-enrollment law, but cautioned that its current form curbs its impact on private saving. While it is a step in the right direction, important design weaknesses risk undermining its key policy objectives (Box 6).

In addition, staff argued that the contribution rate should be increased to at least 6 percent, in order for the new regime to have a meaningful impact on private saving. </P><P MCID="2">41.      There was agreement on the need for better integration of refugees. Turkey is hosting a large number of refugees, who are entitled to public services and work in the informal sector. Legislative changes in January 2016 allowed Syrian refugees to apply for work permits. Thus far, the uptake has been very low, due to legislative restrictions, skill mismatches, and administrative hurdles for employers and employees (Box 7). Staff argued for simplification of the application process for work permits and an active communication strategy to improve the uptake. In March 2016, the EU and Turkey agreed on a framework to reduce irregular migration and channel international assistance to refugees in Turkey. The disbursement of earmarked funds has been slow, due to the complexity of the task of coordinating the work of a large number of NGOs and public agencies, while ensuring proper utilization of funds.

The challenges facing Turkey have increased considerably since the last Article IV Consultation. Domestic political uncertainty has increased significantly, taking a toll on economic activity and testing several key domestic institutions. International conditions have also become more challenging, marked by a rise in interest rates and dollar strength. Weak confidence and a rapidly depreciating lira are reinforcing one another, raising concerns about the resilience of the nonfinancial sector. The preceding benign period has not resolved pre-existing weaknesses, including large current account deficits, high external financing needs, large FX-denominated debt in nonfinancial corporates, a weak business climate, and high inflation. Moreover, productivity is lagging and growth potential has declined against the background of structural bottlenecks and low private investment rates.  </P><P MCID="5">45.      Institutional strength is a pre-requisite to tackle these challenges. Particularly in the aftermath of the failed coup attempt, it is essential that key economic and financial public institutions remain strong and credible, with their mandates preserved, and their policy frameworks brought further towards international best practice. As staff has emphasized, there is a need to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism, and to enhance the management of contingent liabilities. The FSAP underscores important avenues by which financial sector oversight and supervision could be strengthened. </P><P MCID="6">46.      Stronger macro-financial policies are necessary to bring down stubbornly high inflation and reduce external vulnerabilities. The root causes of Turkey’s vulnerabilities are structural (low private saving) and cyclical (externally funded, private sector up-leveraging favored by easy international financing conditions). These weaknesses are exacerbated by the persistent overshooting of the inflation target and risks stemming from the large, negative FX position of the economy. Banks and corporates are leveraged and highly exposed to risks stemming from the high share of borrowing in foreign currency. </P><P MCID="7">47.      Avoiding an excessive slowdown is essential in the short run. While some near-term slowdown in economic activity is beneficial to reduce external imbalances, a large fall in GDP growth could lead to a vicious credit-income contraction cycle.

In the medium-term, rebuilding buffers and tackling structural weaknesses is important.  Simplifying of the monetary policy framework and rebuilding credibility by appropriate tightening of monetary policy are necessary steps toward reducing inflation.

The focus of macroprudential policies should be kept squarely on maintaining the soundness of the financial system. Finally, net international reserves should be increased.  </P><P MCID="2">49.      Slow progress with structural reforms and heightened political and economic uncertainty are keeping the economy from reaching its full potential.

Assessing the Impact of Shocks to Tourism  </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">A decade of vibrant development made the tourism sector an important driver of the economic activity. Turkey’s share in the global inbound tourist flows increased from 1.5 percent in early 2000s to about 3 percent in 2015. Over that period the number of foreign tourists’ arrivals tripled and reached 36.2 million people. In 2007 the government launched a sector development program (Strategy 2023), which included investment incentives, measures to address transportation and infrastructure bottlenecks, and marketing activities. In 8 years, country’s capacity to accommodate tourists increased 2.5 times. In 2015, travel services earned around US$27bn of exports revenues (3.7 percent of GDP and about 13 percent of total export proceeds). In selected regions, it is one of the key employers. Overall, the tourism sector was estimated to directly generate about 600 000 jobs (2.3 percent of the total employment), additional approximately one million of is estimated to be created indirectly1.  </P><P MCID="3">In 2016 Turkey was hit by a major fall in foreign tourists’ arrivals, and recovery prospects remain subdued. Tourist arrivals from Europe fell by over 30 percent, against the backdrop of a sharp rise in the number of and a severity of terrorist attacks in Turkey in the last few years. In addition to that, Russian restrictions on charter flights and travel tours cut the Russian tourists by more than two-thirds in January-September. This contributed to about 30 percent drop in exports of transportation services, and had negative spillovers to the food and accommodation sectors. Studies show that repeated terrorist attacks coupled with political uncertainty tend to have long lasting effect on foreign tourist arrivals. While the Russian sanctions were lifted in 3Q 2016, repeated incidences of violence suggest that recovery of the tourist inflows may appear weak due to security concerns.  </P><P MCID="4">Given linkages between tourism and other sectors, a 10 percent shock to foreign arrivals is estimated to have 0.3-0.5 percent impact on GDP in the first year after the shock.2 This accounts for the fall in gross value added in food and accommodation and transportation of about 2 percent and 3 percent respectively. These three sectors represent over 46 percent of total tourist expenditures, and are the first to experience the shock. The assessment is based on a Bayesian VAR model estimated on quarterly data between 1998 and 2015. The model predicted that absent of policy measure to offset the impact of the weak tourism sector and other positive shocks GDP would decelerate to around 2 percent in 2016.  </P><P MCID="5">_____________________________ </P><P MCID="6">1/ Source: Estimates by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

Turkey: Contingent Liabilities Related to PPP and other Treasury Guarantees </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">The size of the overall PPP portfolio in Turkey has sharply risen in recent years, reflecting the active infrastructure agenda of the authorities. Total investment size has increased fivefold since 2010, mostly in transportation, energy, and health (Figure 1). Total investment value stands at $53 billion for 211 projects, of which 33 PPP projects with total investment value of US$38.8 billion are under construction.  </P><P MCID="3">Management of PPPs and their fiscal risks is fragmented. The legal and regulatory framework for PPPs is highly fragmented both across sectors and type of PPP arrangements. For example, health, education, and energy PPPs are subject to specific legislation apart from the existing BOT law. Similarly, fiscal risks arising from PPP-related guarantees are subject to different degrees of monitoring, depending whether they are under the control of the Treasury or other public entities (see below). Annual budget laws set upper limits for contingent liabilities, but only for those provided by the Treasury. </P><P MCID="4">The Treasury’s contingent liability commitments are regularly disclosed in its monthly Public Debt Management Reports. Of the various guarantees that the Treasury provides, the external debt repayment guarantee is most actively used. In addition, the Debt Assumption Commitments (DACs)—wherein senior loan payment guarantees could be extended by the Treasury as well as by the special budget administrations and SOEs for PPP projects that satisfy certain conditions—have also been used from 2012 onwards. The outstanding stock of Treasury guaranteed external debt stood at US$12 billion, and separately, the loans for which Treasury offered debt assumption for 3 PPP projects stood at US$8.7 billion.  </P><P MCID="5">Information on guarantees issued by other public entities is scarce. The size and terms of contractual obligations are generally not disclosed for PPP projects under line ministries and other public agencies. This applies to both DACs issued by other public entities and FX-denominated price and volume guarantees provided to various PPP projects. Quantification of the size of overall exposure is challenging due to lack of information. Focusing on exposure from DACs on projects under construction and assuming that: (a) only the minimum 20 percent of the total investment is equity financed; and (b) all of the remaining financing is external debt covered by DACs, the estimated size of contingent liabilities would be roughly 4 percent of GDP (including the Treasury DACs above). The size of overall contingent liabilities could vary in reality, depending on whether there are older and new projects with separate price and volume guarantees, and the actual amounts of equity and external finance match the assumptions made.  </P><P MCID="6">The stock of standard Treasury guarantees to public banks has risen in recent years. The share of financial institutions in Treasury guaranteed external debt has risen to over 80 percent in 2015 from 43 percent in 2006 (Figure 2). The share of public banks increased especially sharply, from 2 percent of external debt guarantees in 2006 to 55 percent in 2015. The authorities justified this shift by the superior internal risk management expertise of these institutions relative to other beneficiaries. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9">020406080100024681012142006200720082009201020112012201320142015Treasury Guaranteed Total External Debt StockShare of Financial Institutions (percent, rhs axis)1/ Financial Institutions inlcude public banks, VakifBank, and TSKBOutstanding Stock of Treasury Guaranteed External Debt  (Billion of U.S. dollars)</P><P MCID="10">05101520253035048121620PPP Project Potfolio: Investment Size by Sector In US$ bln (lhs)In percent of total</P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Turkey: Summary of FSAP Findings and Recommendations </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Turkish banks can reasonably withstand severe stress provided it is short-lived, but capital shortfalls can become significant should stress persist, and systemic risks and spillovers become high. </P><P MCID="3">Supervision of banks, insurance companies, and FMIs. Assessments against international standards spotlighted areas requiring further enhancements: (i) further development and deepening of the risk assessment nature of banking inspections and follow up; (ii) applying greater rigor to the supervisory evaluation and enforcement of credit risk and corporate governance rules; (iii) stronger governance, independence and accountability would advance insurance supervision, which would be further enhanced by the closer integration of supervisory functions, and additional focus on corporate governance and internal controls within insurers; (iv) for the National Payments System (NPS), authorities should address concentration of intraday liquidity at the end of the day, and institute a risk management framework for interdependencies among FMIs. </P><P MCID="4">Oversight and management of systemic risks. Stronger arrangements would be beneficial.  In particular: (i) additional clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the Financial Stability Committee (FSC), the Council of Ministers, and of FSC member authorities, would be helpful; (ii) an explicit financial stability objective could be provided for all FSC members; (iii) procedures to support more integrated risk identification and ensure ex ante review of alternative policy options by the FSC could be implemented; (iv) coordination of policy actions and follow-up would be strengthened by an agreement by member agencies to consider and to respond to FSC recommendations in advance of taking policy decisions; and (iv) overall transparency and disclosure need to be enhanced to foster credibility and accountability. </P><P MCID="5">Crisis management and resolution., Key priorities include: legal changes to (i) equip BRSA with effective recovery planning powers and empower SDIF to undertake resolvability assessments and resolution planning, and to empower both agencies to require banks to make necessary changes to make plans implementable; (ii) establish new resolutions tools for the SDIF, including powers for more comprehensive business transfer, for establishing and capitalizing bridge banks, and for implementing bail-in; and (iii) facilitate international bank data sharing by SDIF. Institutional arrangements should be strengthened to: (i) provide additional clarification on various agencies’ responsibilities; (ii) limit BRSA involvement to pulling the trigger for resolution and not also defining the type of resolution; (iii) provide more effective coordination with FSC activities; and review resolution funding arrangements with the aim to reduce contingent claims on taxpayers. Cross-border recovery and resolution arrangements should be bolstered </P><P MCID="6">Systemic liquidity management. key priorities include: (i) orienting liquidity provision towards a single key policy rate; (ii) increase net reserves such that gross reserves are within the range of 100–150 percent of the ARA metric; (iii) redefine CBRT FX lending facility as ELA and increase conditionality; and (v) improve ELA capacity (testing procedures, expand range of collateral, processes for government indemnities for CBRT). </P><P MCID="7">Development of capital markets. This could decrease reliance on foreign currency. Policies to support the consolidation of an interest rate derivatives market and stimulate liquidity in government and corporate bond markets could facilitate hedging against interest rate fluctuations and enhance demand for capital market products. Improvements in issuance regulations, disclosure and governance standards could restore investor confidence, which has been recently shaken by renegotiations of corporate debt and poor performance of IPOs. </P><P MCID="8">Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Priorities include: (i) completing the national ML/TF risk assessment; (ii) addressing the low level of convictions for ML; and (iii) introducing customer due diligence requirements for politically exposed persons in line with the FATF standard, as well as measures to mitigate the associated risks; (iv) effectively implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions requirements relating to terrorist funds, and implementing  and strengthening measures to monitor cross-border transportation of cash.  </P><P MCID="9">Source: Turkey 2016 FSSA. </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">  </P></page>

Turkey: Refugees in Turkey – Recent Developments </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Turkey is one of the largest refugee-hosting countries with around 3 million of refugees. Officially registered Syrian refugees are about 2.75 million (45 percent of whom are children aged below 18) (UNHCR, 2016), and refugees of other nationalities are estimated to be almost 0.3 million. However, some registered refugees might have left, while there may be other non-registered refugees in Turkey, making precise estimation of refugee numbers difficult. The government has begun validating the registration records and plans to complete this exercise by mid-2017. This would also provide information on refugee movements within Turkey, and thus improve targeting of financial assistance. </P><P MCID="3">Given the large number of refugees, social and economic integration is challenging but crucial. Around 90 percent of Syrian refugees had left the temporary protection centers (AFAD, 2016). Prior to 2016, they could only work in the informal sector, which seems to have negatively affected local informal workers with low labor force attachments, such as women and the low-skilled (Del Carpio and Wagner, 2015). Legislative changes in January 2016 allow Syrian refugees to apply for work permits. However, at end-October, only around 13,000 applications by Syrian refugees have been received (of which 10,000 were approved, with one-third of the permits granted to the textile and wholesale and retail industries). The low uptake may be explained by restrictions, such as firm-level quotas and requiring refugees to apply for permits only in the municipality of initial registration, administrative hurdles, and limited communication. Qualifications recognition, skill mismatch, and language difficulties may also contribute to limited integration into formal employment. </P><P MCID="4">International assistance could play an important role. Under the EU-Turkey agreement to reduce irregular migration, the Facility for Refugees in Turkey was set up to provide support to refugees in Turkey in the areas of humanitarian assistance, education, migration management, health, municipal infrastructure, and socio-economic development. The Facility has an initial budget of €3 billion for 2016–17, and additional funding of up to €3 billion by end-2018. As of end-October, of the overall initial budget, the total funding allocated for implementation on humanitarian and non-humanitarian actions stood at €2.2 billion. Of these €2.2 billion, 34 projects have been contracted worth €1.2 billion, out of which €677 million have been disbursed to the implementation units.  </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">The largest humanitarian support und</P><P MCID="9">er the Facility is the </P><P MCID="10">Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), which provid</P><P MCID="11">es</P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">direct </P><P MCID="14">monthly cash transfers through debit cards to cover basic </P><P MCID="15">needs of the most vulnerable refugee families.

The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

External debt continued to increase and is estimated to reach 59 percent of GDP in 2016. A large share of the external debt, about 26 percent of GDP, resides with banks who intermediate capital inflows into domestic loans, mostly in Lira but also in foreign currency. Non-financial corporates (NFC) also recently have been borrowing directly from abroad. NFC’s external debt is estimated to exceed 19 percent of GDP in 2016, increasing by about US$12bn over the year. Bank loans constitute about over 60 percent of total external debt of the outstanding debt stock of the private sector. However, the role of portfolio flows has increased recently, reflecting lower demand for project loans, borrower’s efforts to diversify investor, as well as changes in creditor preferences in favor of more liquid instruments. Private creditors, including bondholders, hold close to 90 percent of Turkey’s total external debt.  </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">2.      While the maturity structure has recently improved, the cost of financing is increasing. The stock of short-term debt with original maturity of less than 12 months fell markedly in 2015. An increase in reserve requirements on short term liabilities encouraged banks to take debt with longer maturities, while NFCs were borrowing directly from abroad with medium and long-term debt maturities. In practice, however, a significant part of the short-term syndicated loans was extended by just a few days or months beyond the critical threshold of 365 days.

Turkey’s external debt, while sustainable, is vulnerable to valuation shocks. The debt trajectory stabilizes under the baseline at around 64 percent of GDP. Given that over 90 percent of Turkish external debt is denominated in foreign currency, the debt path is susceptible to exchange rate movements. Standard stress tests suggest debt level could increase substantially under the real depreciation shock. A permanent Lira depreciation by 30 percent would push the external debt stock to 85 percent of GDP by 2021. This analysis however does not account for the potential contraction of the current account deficit associated with such sharp currency movements. A steeper recovery of fuel prices, leading to non-interest current deficit of about 4.2 percent would push the debt ratio to around 69 percent of GDP over the medium term.  </P><P MCID="3">4.      Large external financing requirements and a significant share of debt with adjustable rates make the economy vulnerable to shifts in global liquidity.  Despite some increase in average maturity of external debt, annual rollover needs remain close to a quarter of GDP. Total external financing needs are about 30 percent of GDP over the next few years. Over 60 percent of total external debt, including debt with short maturities, is indexed to global interest rates. As a result, a tightening of global liquidity conditions, an increase in Turkey spreads, or capital outflows from emerging markets in general could quickly translate into higher borrowing costs. According to the DSA simulation results, an increase in interest rates by 1 standard deviation compared to the baseline would increase the debt level by additional 3 percentage points to 66 percent of GDP. Moreover, a sudden stop in capital flows may trigger a simultaneous rise in both borrowing costs and exchange rate pressure. </P><P MCID="4"> </P></page>

Public Debt Sustainability </P><P MCID="1">At about 35 percent of GDP (measured as general government gross debt according to Maastricht criteria), Turkey’s public debt ratio is well below its historical ten-year average. Gross public sector financing needs have declined significantly and will remain low over the medium term. The DSA suggests that Turkey’s government debt is sustainable under different shock scenarios. Given the debt structure (average maturity of 6.2 years, 68 percent of total debt at fixed interest rates, and only 35 percent of the debt in foreign exchange) the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget is relatively low. Lower GDP growth rates, potentially combined with other macro shocks or a contingent liability shock, would lead to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. While all public debt profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks, the high external financing requirements point to risks arising from the external debt position.  </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Baseline and Realism of Projections1 </P><P MCID="4">1.      Debt-levels. Turkey’s debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate at 32.9 percent at end-2015. Staff forecast that the ratio will slightly increase in the short-run due to the ongoing and projected fiscal expansion before resuming its declining path. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 34.8 percent in 2021—up by 2 pp since end-2015. The interest rate/growth differential contributes to the decline in debt-to-GDP ratio, while the primary balance first contributes to an increase then a decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio. At 5.3 percent of GDP in 2015, gross public financing needs have declined from 15 percent on average for 2005–13—a significant accomplishment.  </P><P MCID="5">2.      Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes show high forecast errors, possibly due to high volatility of GDP in Turkey, but don’t seem to have a systematic bias that undermine the assessment of sustainability. The current growth projections are similar to the levels for 2014–15, which lessens their positive impact in reducing the level of debt. A negative output gap is opening, but is projected to close over the medium term. Turkey’s debt is highly sensitive to big swings in GDP growth, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks in the stress tests.  </P><P MCID="6">3.      Sovereign yields. Turkey’s yields remain volatile, although they remain below the levels of the first quarter of 2014. The spreads against the US bonds in the last three months remained on average at 331 bps, higher than its lowest value of 118 bps observed in May 2013. The effective interest rate is forecast to decline from 8.8 percent in 2015 to 8.1 percent in 2016. However, in the medium term the effective rates are expected to increase due to the push from international rates. </P><P MCID="7">4.      Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline the structural primary balance improves in the medium term. The maximum projected 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is 2 percent of GDP, while the maximum projected 3-year average level of cyclically-adjusted primary balance is 0.8 percent of GDP. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="8">1 The new DSA framework is described in (</P><Span MCID="9">http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf</Span><P MCID="10">). </P></page>

Maturity and rollover. Given the current debt structure (average maturity of 6.2 years, 69 percent share of fixed interest debt to total debt, and only 35 percent denominated in foreign currency), the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget are small.  </P><P MCID="1">Shocks and Stress Tests  </P><P MCID="2">6.      Primary balance and interest rate shocks do not affect the debt dynamics substantially, while growth shock and contingent liability shocks lead to a temporary increase in debt. </P><P MCID="3"> Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 1.0pp of GDP in the primary balance for 2 years slows down the downward trend of debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline. Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance). The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs levels by 2021 is modest.  </P><P MCID="4"> Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or 4.2 percentage points, for 2 years starting in 2017. The decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). The nominal primary balance deteriorates significantly compared to the baseline, as nominal revenues fall against unchanged expenditure plans, reaching -5 percent of GDP by 2018. The deterioration in primary balance leads to higher sovereign borrowing costs. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases to about 46 percent during the growth shock and then gradually trends down.  Gross public financing needs climb toward 16.3 percent of GDP before trending down to 14.2 percent of GDP by the end of the period.  </P><P MCID="5"> Interest rate shock. The real effective rate reaches similar levels as in 2009, which implies a permanent increase in spreads by about 400bps. The government’s interest bill reaches an implicit average interest rate of 15 percent by 2021. The debt-to-GDP ratio climbs to around 39 percent, and gross public financing needs increase to around 13 percent of GDP by 2021.  </P><P MCID="6"> Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector is assumed to increase non-interest expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets.2 This is combined with real GDP growth shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance) while inflation declines (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). Debt rises to 45 percent of GDP in 2018 and then gradually declines. Gross public financing needs increase to about 14 percent of GDP in the medium term. </P><P MCID="7">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="8">2 This shock is equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP. The shock could also be seen to cover (a combination of) other contingencies, part of which could be a bailout of PPP projects or loan guarantees. PPP projects with treasury investment guarantees amount to 0.9 percent of GDP, treasury guaranteed loans (outside the general government) amount to 1.6 percent of GDP, and loan subject to debt assumption amount to 1.1 percent of GDP. </P></page>

Turkey and the World Bank Group (WBG) have a strong partnership, that is based on Turkey’s National Development Plans (NDPs). The 10th Development Plan (2014–18) outlines the priority development areas for the Government, and the WBG’s current and future programs aim to support key aspects of this plan. The WBG is preparing a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), which have been shared with the Government and will soon be finalized. This SCD discusses the main challenges to reducing poverty and sustaining growth in Turkey. The SCD and NDP both provide a strong foundation for the new WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF) that is under preparation. The CPF will outline the WBG’s strategy for FY17–21 and articulate the main areas of the WBG engagement, both technically and financially. </P><P MCID="4">2.      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY12-16 has delivered financing of over US$9.6 billion. Throughout the CPS period, project implementation has been smooth, meeting disbursement targets and development objectives. The CPS financing includes US$4.3 billion through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), US$3.6 billion through the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and nearly US$1.7 billion though the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). </P><P MCID="5">A.   International Bank for Reconstruction and Development </P><P MCID="6">3.      Turkey is the sixth-largest borrower of the IBRD in terms of debt outstanding. Turkey’s active portfolio of investment operations with the World Bank’s IBRD financing includes 12 projects with total net commitments of US$4.5 billion (as of November 2016). The investment portfolio and pipeline support the energy sector, financial and private sector development, urban development, and health care. </P><P MCID="7">4.      Turkey values the WBG’s analytical and technical knowledge work. Analytical work allowed the WBG to provide knowledge in priority areas that were supportive of a wide range of Turkey`s development challenges. The WBG responded to client demand for partnership in delivering global knowledge and analytical work. A growing area of common interest is sharing Turkey’s experiences with other developing countries.  </P><P MCID="8">5.      A key engagement also concerns the Syrian refugees living in Turkey. The WBG is currently providing assistance in the area of social support and adaptation, labor markets, and the economy, and education, as well as in the cross-cutting areas of data collection, measurement, and monitoring. </P><P MCID="9">B.   International Finance Corporation </P><P MCID="10">6.      With the committed portfolio of around US$3.8 billion, Turkey represents the second-largest country exposure for the IFC globally. In FY16, the IFC had a fourth consecutive record year in Turkey, investing US$1.8 billion in projects to improve municipal services, combat climate change, develop local capital markets, bolster supplies of renewable energy, and support smaller businesses. </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

IFC’s committed portfolio at the beginning of the CPS period (FY12) stood at US$2.3 billion (own account), while at the end of the FY16 it increased to US$3.8 billion. The portfolio has been further diversified, with financial markets operations decreasing from 48 percent in FY12 to 41 percent in FY16, infrastructure increasing from 27 to 34 percent, manufacturing, services and agriculture portfolio falling from about 22 to 20 percent, and media, technology and telecommunications increasing from 3 to 5 percent. The quality of the portfolio also improved, as NPLs decreased from $68.6 million at the beginning of the CPS period to $15.3 million at the end of FY16 (or from 3.9 percent to 0.6 percent of outstanding loan portfolio).  </P><P MCID="1">C.   Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency </P><P MCID="2">8.      Turkey is MIGA’s largest country by gross exposure, representing almost 12 percent of MIGA’s gross portfolio. In FY16, MIGA’s portfolio in the country comprised a number of projects in the infrastructure, financial, and services sectors with gross exposure of US$1.695 billion or net exposure of US$537 million. MIGA intervention helped mobilize foreign private financing in support of key strategic areas of the economy, such as healthcare, the financial sector, and the transport sector. MIGA’s product mix include the traditional political risk insurance as well as the non-honoring, credit guarantee product.</P></page>

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance </P><P MCID="4"></P><P MCID="5">General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite some shortcomings especially in national accounts and government finance statistics.  </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7">National Accounts:  Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2–3 month lag. The Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) compiles and disseminates quarterly GDP by production and expenditure approaches, in current prices and in volume terms. The annual GDP is a sum of the four quarters. The GDP by income approach was estimated for 2002–2012, but the results are not yet published. The main weaknesses of the system for compiling quarterly GDP at current prices are the lack of annual benchmarks and the reliance of fixed ratios that are outdated (ratios from the 2002 Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) are used). TURKSTAT is now putting in place a regular compilation system for independent annual estimates of GDP and for quarterly GDP benchmarked to annual data. TURKSTAT plans to disseminate revised series of national accounts estimates—both annual and quarterly data, covering the period 2009–15—based on the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA)/The European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in the coming months. Sectoral financial balance sheets are compiled on a quarterly basis. Sectoral income accounts data for 2009–15 are expected to be published in the coming months. </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9">Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) generally conform to international standards. The CPI does not cover owner-occupied dwellings, commodities produced by households for own consumption, and expenditures on commodities obtained through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled only by product (and not by economic activity). </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">Government Finance Statistics: Coverage of the budget is largely complete. Data for some fiscal operations conducted through extra budgetary funds are available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is further complicated by some quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks, state owned enterprises (SOEs), and other public entities; and technical problems associated with consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in the accounting of external debt flows and central government deposits. </P><P MCID="12">The latest data available for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are for 2015 and cover the general government sector and its subsectors with coverage of both stocks and flows, including a full general government balance sheet. Monthly budgetary data on a cash basis and quarterly general government data on an accrual basis are reported on an irregular basis for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS), starting from September 2009. </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14"></P></page>

On December 8th, a policy package in support of the economy was announced. On December 12th, historical GDP data have been revised up.

The economy contracted in Q3 2016 but there are signs of stabilization in Q4. After slowing in Q2, the seasonally and calendar adjusted GDP contracted by 2.7 percent in Q3 2016 compared to the previous quarter, mostly as high public expenditures could not offset weakness in private consumption and investment.  In Q4, high frequency indicators, including sales of durable goods, house sales, VAT on imports, consumer loan growth, suggest stabilization (and mild recovery in some sectors) for domestic private consumption.  However, industrial production, consumer as well as business sentiment, and job creation remain weak. </P><P MCID="14">2.      The Lira continued weakening in December, bringing the depreciation in the last three months to about 20 percent with respect to the US dollars. This has further amplified the pressures on corporate balance sheets and bank asset quality, stemming from the high share of foreign currency (FX) loans. The government has taken steps to reduce domestic use of FX. It has instructed public institutions to collect FX receivables in lira in the short term, and make new public procurement contracts payable in lira. Gross international reserves (GIR) have declined by US$4 billion to US$114 billion in November and continued to fall in December. Net international reserves remained broadly stable, as the fall in GIR was driven mainly by the withdrawal of banks’ FX deposits, including due to lower reserve requirements. </P><P MCID="15">3.

The new measures are intended to be financed by (unidentified) expenditure reallocation. The authorities estimate the cost of the state guarantees to be no greater than TRY 17.5 billion (0.6–0.7 percent of GDP) for state guarantees and TRY 15–16 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) for the other measures over three years. The authorities plan to fund these measures by shifting existing budgetary allocations, and have ruled out tax increases or additional borrowing for the new measures. However, sources of financing have not been identified within the budget. </P><P MCID="2">Revision of national accounts data </P><P MCID="3">5.      On December 12th, 2016, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) announced major revisions to national accounts data. The revision and newly published data address some areas identified by staff as needing improvement in the national statistics.1 The revisions primarily affect the period 2009–15. The data changes are mostly on account of updated methodology, improved estimation methods, and implementation of the latest versions of international statistics  standards—System of National Accounts, 2008 and European System of Accounts, 2010.2  </P><P MCID="4">6.      Both nominal and real GDP were revised up. The largest changes are for the period  2011–2015, over which annual real GDP growth has been revised up by an average of 2.7 percentage points (Table 1.) The upward revision mostly affected construction and financial service sectors, as well as investment. </P><P MCID="5">Staff assessment </P><P MCID="6">7.      The authorities’ policy measures build on the approach they have taken to date to strengthen demand, but staff maintains the reservations noted in the staff report. The new measures may ease existing loan supply constraints but their effect is probably limited in the current uncertain situation. The measures do not address the underlying causes of the credit slowdown, including the heightened counterparty risk resulting from domestic uncertainty, and the effect of a weakening currency on the corporate debt overhang.

The data revisions improved external sector indicators but not enough to change staff’s assessment of the external sector position. The revisions lower the current account (CA) deficit in 2015 to 3.8 percent of GDP (0.7 percent of GDP lower than before the revision.) Ratios of the external debt and the net international investment position (NIIP) to GDP stand at 46 and 44 percent at end-2015 (9 percentage points lower than before the revision) with similar adjustments expected in 2016. Consequently, staff assesses that the 2016 CA gap is in the range of -1 to -3 percent of GDP, and Turkey’s external position remains weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The external debt remains sustainable, but the NIIP is still projected to widen significantly over the medium term.  </P><P MCID="2">9.      Similarly, staff’s assessment of fiscal space remains broadly unchanged. The GDP data revisions imply that the 2015 fiscal deficit is 0.2 percent of GDP lower (Figure 1.) The decline in the end-2015 public debt ratio is 5 percent of GDP. However, data revisions also imply lower fiscal revenues relative to the size of the economy. Public debt is sustainable and there is some fiscal space for temporary stimulus. However, persistent external imbalances, and the dependence of the banking and corporate sectors on external financing with substantial rollover needs, call for prudence in using fiscal space.  </P><P MCID="3">10.      The statistical revision and policy initiatives do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. Staff’s assessment of underlying economic developments post-data revision, is consistent with its views at the time of the Article IV consultation policy discussions. The GDP data confirm that the economy has been contracting. Therefore, staff maintains its recommendation for moderately looser fiscal and tighter monetary stance. The new measures further ease the macroprudential regime and add to public contingent liabilities, increasing the risks which are discussed in the Staff Report.  </P><P MCID="4">11.      </P><P MCID="5">The authorities indicated that the revised national accounts data will not</P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">alter the</P><P MCID="8">ir</P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">objectives and key tenets of economic policy making.</P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">Economic policies will focus on increasing </P><P MCID="13">stable and inclusive growth, reducing inflation, preserving the downward trend in </P><P MCID="14">the </P><P MCID="15">current </P><P MCID="16">account deficit, enhancing competitiveness, employmen</P><P MCID="17">t and productivity, improving the quality of </P><P MCID="18">fiscal discipline, and strengthening public finances in the medium term.</P><P MCID="19"> </P><P MCID="20">  </P></page>

<page id="71" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"> Statement by Mr. Taşkın Temiz, Alternate Executive Director for Turkey January 11, 2017 We thank staff for the comprehensive papers. The Turkish authorities convey their appreciation for the constructive discussions and comprehensive analyses during the Article IV and FSAP consultations. I. Overview  Political, macroeconomic and financial stability have been the basis for Turkey’s economic performance and structural transformation, raising Turkey’s status to an upper middle-income country and increasing its resilience to shocks. External and domestic uncertainties have heightened recently. External headwinds include the subdued global economic and productivity growth, bouts of financial market volatility, the strengthening US dollar, sluggish global trade prospects, the ongoing realignments in China and commodity exporter countries as well as the current difficult geopolitical environment. Turkey has also faced homegrown challenges stemming from the huge influx of refugees, terrorist attacks and a failed coup attempt. Turkey has managed to mitigate the implications of all these challenges weighing on its economic outlook and preserved its resilience to both external and internal shocks mostly owing to its solid macroeconomic fundamentals and sound macro-framework, which are based on the following three long-standing pillars: 1. A prudent public sector financial management framework. The strong fiscal position and economic growth, together with decelerating real interest rates, put public debt on a downward trend to sustainable levels. 2. Sound implementation of monetary policy. An independent central bank, inflation targeting and flexible exchange-rate regimes have been essential for securing financial stability and bringing the inflation rate closer to the target. 3. A strong financial sector with a solid regulation and supervision framework. Together, the Turkish Treasury, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), the Capital Markets Board (CMB) and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) have established solid risk management and monitoring capabilities. The financial system, without any solvency problems, is supported by robust macro-prudential and resolution frameworks while the regulatory framework has been significantly upgraded. The Financial Stability Committee has been an effective coordinating body. Local currency bond and equity markets have developed further; the financial instruments are diversified and maturities extended.  In addition, an open economy, Turkey has a dynamic and flexible private sector; households with no FX liabilities; increasing per capita income; a diversified and large economy; a favorable demographic structure with a young population and an increasing female labor participation; diverse trade linkages and improved physical infrastructure.  </page>
<page id="72" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">2 The authorities remain determined to address the persistent structural issues. The low productivity level, relatively low saving rates, a noticeable current account deficit, gross external financing need and labor market rigidities weigh on the Turkish economy. The authorities have been taking the necessary policy actions and measures to promote growth and further boost the economy’s resilience by implementing sound macroeconomic policies and the structural reforms as laid out in the 2014–2018 Development Plan and in the     2017–2019 Medium-Term Program (MTP).   II. Recent Macroeconomic Developments  Despite the strong headwinds, the Turkish economy has remained resilient thanks to strong fiscal and monetary policies and a sound financial system. Economic activity remained buoyant and expanded by 3.9 percent in the first half of 2016, driven mostly by domestic demand and supported by the services and industrial sectors. The tourism sector contracted amid geopolitical tensions and the output in the agricultural sector remained lackluster due to adverse weather conditions. The failed coup attempt took its toll on confidence and weighed on consumption and investment expenditures, resulting in a decline in economic activity in the third quarter of 2016. It is worth emphasizing that calendar effects have also played a major role in limiting the growth prospects in the third quarter. Economic activity rebounded in the last quarter due to increased domestic demand following the recovery in consumer loans. The authorities estimate headline growth to remain moderate in 2016.   Immediately after the coup attempt, the Turkish authorities introduced measures to shore up financial markets operations and liquidity. The CBRT announced measures geared toward providing banks with the needed liquidity. At the same time, banks were allowed to place FX deposits as collateral without limits for needed Turkish Lira liquidity. The CBRT has started a gradual withdrawal of the unlimited provision of Turkish Lira liquidity against FX collateral since November 2016.1  The inflation rate has remained high mostly due to food prices and the domestic currency depreciation and the increases in energy prices on the back of tax adjustments and administered prices. Food inflation, which had been among the main drivers of headline inflation, lost steam as tourism fell and the decline in exports to Russia lifted the pressure on domestic food prices. The lagging effects of the cumulative exchange rate developments and tax adjustments continue to weigh on the annual inflation and core inflation figures. Wage developments added to the cost side pressures and limited the improvement in the consumer price inflation in 2016.                                                   1 Implementation of limits for FX collateral deposits placed with the CBRT restarted as of November 11, 2016. Banks’ limits are applied as four times the limits allocated before July 17, 2016. </page>
<page id="73" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">3 Plunging tourism revenues impacted the improvement in the current account shortfall. Tourism receipts have been a major element in mitigating the chronic deficit in the trade balance. Although the deterioration in tourism in 2016 is estimated to have wiped out around 1 percent of GDP, the improvement in the energy balance and the gains in market share in the EU helped mitigate the impact on the current account deficit. TURKSTAT recently revised the GDP series and its breakdown to align the methodology with the EU and UN. The revisions may affect the assessments of the Turkish economy. But, considering the cut-off date and data set in the staff report, the economic references in this statement—unless otherwise stated—apply the old GDP series.  The revised national accounts data, despite implying great policy buffers, will not alter the objectives and key tenets of the economic policy making. Policies will be geared toward promoting stable and inclusive growth, lowering the inflation rate toward the target level, preserving the downward trend in external imbalances, enhancing competitiveness, employment and productivity, improving the quality of fiscal discipline, and strengthening public finances. III. Economic Outlook  The 2017–2019 MTP, announced in October 2016, envisages a slightly higher growth outlook compared to staff’s projections. Growth is expected to gain pace and reach 4.4 percent next year on the back of a recovery in the tourism sector and domestic demand driven by a pickup in private investment and consumption in response to measures introduced by the government recently. The authorities expect a growth rate of 5 percent in 2018 and 2019 as global and domestic uncertainties gradually wane, private investments, supported by investment incentives, should improve, while structural reforms are expected to raise total factor productivity (TFP).  Price pressures will ease gradually bringing the inflation rate closer to the target in the medium term. The authorities expect inflation to gradually decline in 2017 and reach 5 percent in 2018, supported by a cautious monetary policy stance and structural measures to reduce the rigidities especially in food prices. The CBRT remains wary of the potential upside risks which the recent currency weakness could pose on the inflation outlook and will maintain its price stability oriented monetary policy stance.  External rebalancing will prevail at a modest pace. With the normalization of the relations with Russia and the improving confidence, tourism revenues are estimated to rebound gradually. The recent depreciation in the exchange rate, even though cyclical, will also help the rebalancing. Structural reforms to decelerate Turkey’s import dependency are expected to lower the current account deficit in the medium term.   </page>
<page id="74" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">4 IV. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy   The CBRT intends to complete the monetary policy simplification process to improve the transmission mechanism, align the short-term market rates with the funding rate and ultimately ensure funding via a single policy rate. The CBRT slashed its marginal funding rate onwards cumulatively by 250 basis points (bp) to 8.25 percent since March 2016 while keeping the one-week repo and overnight borrowing rates constant until November. The Turkish Lira came under pressure in October due to global and local factors. Concerned about the possible spillovers of the recent FX depreciation on the inflation expectations and pricing behavior, the CBRT hiked the one-week repo rate by 50 basis points to 8.00 percent and the upper end of the corridor by 25 basis points to 8.5 percent in November. In addition to the rate hikes, the FX reserve requirement was cut by 50 bp which released US$1.5 billion to the market and the maximum maturity on FX rediscounts was extended to March 2017 allowing exporters to keep FX proceeds until March 2017. As indicated in the most recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting, inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.  The exchange rate movements are closely monitored. The Central Bank stopped providing direct FX liquidity to the banking system through FX auctions at the end of April in a bid to preserve the level of net FX reserves2 and did not directly intervene in the FX market in the most recent episode of currency volatility but expressed its readiness to intervene directly or provide FX liquidity through flexible auctions if deemed necessary to avert disorderly market conditions. In the meantime, the CBRT has made a number of changes in the FX liquidity provision to ease the pressure on FX supply. FX reserve option coefficients were cut in October and November, providing additional FX liquidity of US$1.3 billion. Moreover, the upper limit of FX reserve requirements that can be maintained on average were increased by 1 point in October, which enabled banks to use US$2.9 billion to meet their FX liquidity needs. To strengthen its reserves, the CBRT has continued to provide export rediscount credits to exporters, improved the conditions of these credits and recently introduced a new facility of the admission of wrought or scrap gold as required reserves. V. Fiscal Policy  Public debt is low and sustainable with a strong composition and management. The public debt burden is projected to fall to 32.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and is envisioned to be below 30 percent at the end of 2019. In addition to the level of public debt its composition in terms of maturity, interest rate, and currency has improved in the last decade. The share of fixed rate debt is 70 percent of the central government debt, boosting the resilience to interest rate shocks. Since around 65 percent is local currency denominated, an additional buffer to foreign currency shocks is provided. The duration of domestic and external debt is around 3 years and 6.5 years respectively, implying a resilience to liquidity shocks. The Turkish Treasury also diversified its portfolio to enhance investor bases and to support local currency                                                  2 The CBRT provided US$3.4 billion through daily USD auctions through April 2016 and directly sold US$4.2 billion to state-owned energy importers in 2016. </page>

The budget deficit has been under control and supportive for macroeconomic stability. The central government and public sector overall deficits are expected at 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP respectively in 2016 and are projected to remain below 2 percent of GDP throughout the MTP period. Taking into account the level of around 2.5 percent of GDP interest payments, the level of the overall deficits explicitly implies positive primary surpluses which would still ensure a declining trend in the public debt burden. Public finance remains supportive to economic growth. Since the 2001 financial crisis, fiscal policy in Turkey was geared toward bringing public debt down to sustainable levels, containing the high inflation and current account deficit via creating high primary surpluses.3 A significant tightening of the primary fiscal balance has helped contain the public debt dynamics and accumulate fiscal buffers. As public debt sustainability is not a concern and given the risks to the growth outlook, the fiscal policy stance was revised in a bid to support near-term growth and also to raise the potential growth in the medium term, while ensuring that the debt-to-GDP ratio remains on a sustainable track. In this respect, the MTP envisages that fiscal policy will aim at boosting growth, maintaining economic stability, keeping the current account deficit at a sustainable level, and stimulating domestic savings and investments. Public infrastructure investments, regional development, education, R&amp;D support and incentives will be the main expenditures.  Fiscal risks are manageable. The Turkish Treasury closely monitors, conducts risk analyses and internally reports all contingent liabilities and risks to the Treasury Debt and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance issued a secondary legislation in July 2015 to enhance the coverage of public institutions beyond the Treasury. The authorities acknowledge the desirability of expanding fiscal risk disclosure to the entities beyond the Turkish Treasury, and strengthening PPP governance. Regarding PPPs specifically, the government declared in the MTP that the process of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of PPP projects will be enhanced; the capacity of public institutions will be improved, and monitoring and managing the risks to debt sustainability stemming from contingent liabilities arising from public investment guarantees and commitments including PPP schemes, will be strengthened. The authorities have already started working on a PPP Framework legislation which is envisaged to be in line with best practices in project monitoring, risk oversight and disclosure. The authorities also reiterate their intention to align the sovereign wealth fund with international best practices. VI. Financial Sector Policies and FSAP  Turkey has a strong regulatory, supervisory and policy framework. The General Framework for the regulation and supervision of the financial sector, oversight and                                                  3 The average (IMF-defined) primary surplus of the public sector between 2003–2008 was 4 percent and 2.2 percent between 2003–2015. The IMF-defined primary surplus is an indicator introduced in 1999 to monitor the entire public sector (including SOEs), subtracting many one-off revenues such as dividend payments from Central Banks and state banks and privatization revenues.  </page>

Moreover, the authorities have made good progress in developing a macro-prudential policy framework and have applied a wide range of tools to contain and mitigate the cyclical build-up of risks, as well as to strengthen the structural resilience and robustness of the Turkish financial system by correcting misaligned incentives and lowering systemic vulnerabilities. With the strategic oversight of the Financial Stability Committee, which brings together the heads of the financial regulatory agencies to exchange views on emerging systemic risks and policy responses, the management of systemic risks further improved. Turkish banks are well-regulated and remain resilient to shocks4. Banks’ capital buffers remain high with an overall capital adequacy ratio of 16 percent, conservative risk weighing and low leverage while liquidity and FX risk management has become more challenging. FSAP stress tests conclude that banks are well-placed to handle short-term liquidity stress. The banking sector dominates the Turkish financial industry, around 90 percent of all financial services, while insurance services and other financial activities also show significant growth potential. The FX debt rollover risk of the banking sector remains limited thanks to the extended maturity of external debt on the back of the amendments in reserve requirement ratios that are inversely related to the maturity of liabilities, and the improvement in the diversification of banks’ external funding across countries as well as long lasting relationships with creditors. The financial sector’s profitability, which has been on the rise driven by the rebound in net interest income and the decline in non-interest expenditures, will benefit from the revisions in the general provision rates in consumer loans and credit cards5.     While the non-financial corporate sector’s (NFCs) debt burden has been elevated, FX assets and the composition of the FX debt provide room to weather exchange rate volatility. NFCs’ FX debt is mostly concentrated in a number of sectors including transportation, energy, construction and health which either generate FX revenues or provide services under the state-guaranteed PPP projects. Moreover, the maturity of FX loans has lengthened (over five years for the majority of loans) and firms’ short-term FX positions are balanced. Additionally, the authorities have been working on a set of macro-prudential measures based on a well-structured methodology. This tool would facilitate hedging FX risks and help the non-financial corporates to be more resilient to potential shocks. Some macro-prudential measures on consumer lending have been calibrated to revitalize domestic demand and thereby lower the risks to financial stability. A revision                                                  4 Regarding the banking sector, the European Commission recently included the Turkish banking sector in the list of equivalent countries. (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/2358 of 20 December 2016) 5 The BRSA has also lowered the general provisions for corporate loans. New general provisions have been effective since January 1, 2017.  </page>

The Turkish authorities are aware of the challenges weighing on the Turkish financial sector. The policy reaction to these challenges has predominantly been structural reforms such as developing money and capital markets, diversifying instruments, extending maturities and enhancing capacity and transparency. In this respect, the Turkish authorities very much appreciate the FSAP, took note of its recommendations and will take them into consideration to enhance the soundness of the Turkish financial market. VII. Structural Reforms  The structural reform agenda is key to achieve high, sustainable and inclusive growth, to raise the national savings rates, to contain the current account deficit and reduce the reliance on external financing, to increase labor force participation and quality and productivity and to improve the rule of law. The government has announced the structural reform program in both 10th Development Plan and the 2017–2019 MTP and has introduced the following reforms in 2016:  Boosting domestic savings: The government initiated a budgetary subsidy to savings account holders that have at least 3 years for the first house and/or for their marriage. Additionally, the new private pension automatic enrollment system will help stimulate total savings and contribute to the rebalancing.6   Incentivizing Research and Development (R&amp;D): The minimum headcount requirement for setting up an R&amp;D company was reduced; the duration of government subsidies to researcher salaries was extended to 2 years and tax exemption was granted to these companies. The new Patent Law was ratified by the Parliament in December as well.   Improving judicial processes: Istanbul Arbitration Centers and Appeals Courts were established, Expert Witness Act and Intellectual Property Act were enacted, which will help further improve the business environment by enhancing the quality of judicial system.   Enhancing the business climate: The authorities have focused on legislative amendments to simplify the administrative and bureaucratic procedures and provide project-based incentives that will lower the tax burden on investment spending, support innovative high-tech projects, deepen the capital markets and strengthen the formal economy. The government has also introduced new regional investment incentive schemes to establish investment hubs in the eastern and southeastern provinces.                                                  6 The specific design features of the reform were discussed extensively with stakeholders and are based on international best practices, country specific circumstances, institutional capacities and market conditions. The government has the authority to increase the contribution rates, if deemed necessary going forward.  </page>
<page id="78" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">8 Additionally, leveraging public procurement will be utilized to increase localization in potential industries.  Enhancing the access of SMEs to bank loans: A new regulation was enacted for collateral registries for movable assets, enabling SMEs to provide their all movable assets as collateral.  Improving the labor market conditions: The flexible employment mechanism was added to the Labor Code to support employment; Private Employment Agencies were set up; maternity rights, access to childcare facilities and part-time work allowance for women until their children reach the age of entry into formal schooling were enhanced to increase female labor force participation; and provision of relevant skill training and effective internship programs implemented. The authorities acknowledge that more progress is needed on the severance pay reform, which requires broad-based consultations with relevant stakeholders in order to support the successful implementation.   Improving the SOE governance: The authorities have also been working on the SOE governance in order to align the governance structure of the SOEs with international best practices and help these enterprises better compete with private companies.  Reforming the Turkish Development Bank: The Turkish Development Bank, in collaboration with some key international stakeholders, is undergoing a restructuring process to enhance the corporate capacity and competitiveness in line with international best practices. Further reforms are planned. Looking ahead, the government is going to establish an Academy for Teachers, develop vocational and technical training to increase the skill sets of the labor force, implement school-based budgeting, provide better foreign language training and compulsory pre-school. Furthermore, tax and expenditure reviews will be the backbones of the fiscal management reforms. Treasury’s commitment to Credit Guarantee Funds will be raised to TRY 25 billion, which could be leveraged up by the Banks to TRY250 billion, from its current commitment level of TRY 2 billion. This step is going to improve the access to finance Turkish SMEs. To enhance entrepreneurship and access to finance, Turkey has also recently introduced the business angel scheme, and is working on the launch of the crowd-funding system. The authorities broadly share staff’s views on rising labor costs, competitiveness, and refugee integration. The temporary minimum wage government subsidy is appropriate and fiscally manageable. The integration of refugees into the workforce remains critical and requires strong international commitment. VIII. Conclusion Turkey has preserved its resilience to both external and internal shocks mostly owing to its solid macroeconomic fundamentals and sound macro-framework. The prudent fiscal position with sustainable low debt, sound monetary policies and a strong financial sector with a solid regulation and supervision framework have been the major pillars. Its open and large economy, dynamic private sector, diversified economy, young and dynamic demography together with its committed institutions have been supportive under high uncertainties.
