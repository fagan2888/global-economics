The economic slowdown has bottomed out in 2016 and there are signs that the economy is on an incipient recovery path. Real growth is estimated at 1.2 percent in 2016 and projected to reach 1.4 percent in 2017, as the external environment strengthens, together with private consumption. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The peso appreciated against the U.S. dollar between April and October 2016, but depreciation pressures reemerged in November, following the U.S. elections. The current account deficit is expected to remain around 2¼ percent of GDP in 2016, and would edge up to 2½ percent in the medium-term as domestic demand recovers.  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">Despite the slowdown in activity, inflation remains at levels above the central bank’s target range. Inflation is projected to slow and remain well below 9 percent in 2017, tapering to about 6 percent in the medium-term as the output gap gradually closes. Monetary policy remains relatively tight but its transmission has been constrained by the high dollarization and low level of peso credit in Uruguay. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">Fiscal policy has remained broadly neutral in 2016 and the public sector deficit is estimated at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2016. In line with the government’s objective to reach a 2.5 percent deficit by 2019, parliament has approved tax increases and expenditure cuts for 2017.  </P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16">Risks to the outlook are both external and domestic, but tempered by Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers and flexible exchange rate. A slower than expected recovery in Argentina and Brazil, and weak growth in China would weigh on Uruguay’s economy, while a tightening in global financial conditions could raise the cost of financing.

Nonetheless, Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers, high level of gross reserves, and flexible exchange rate regime would put the country in good stead to weather such shocks. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Financial stability risks are limited. Non-performing loans remain relatively low, at 3.5 percent of total loans, while provisions are high.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Executive Board Assessment </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Uruguay, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows: </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Uruguay is managing the deep recession in its large neighbors relatively well. After a marked slowdown, growth started to recover in the third quarter of 2016. Investment and consumption bottomed out through mid-2016, as inflation stabilized and the exchange rate stopped depreciating. The current account deficit has been cut in half since 2014, and international reserves have stabilized well above prudential norms. The real effective exchange rate appears aligned with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The external environment continues to present risks. Continued weakness in Argentina and Brazil, and a slowdown in global demand would adversely affect exports, while higher interest rates would raise funding costs and capital flow volatility would complicate the conduct of monetary policy. Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate and strong liquidity buffers would, however, support an orderly adjustment to shocks. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">The authorities have demonstrated a clear commitment to putting the public finances on a sustainable track. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2016 was a helpful response to moderate the sharper-than-expected slowdown. At the same time, the government has locked in tax increases for 2017, sustaining its commitment to bring the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2019 which is projected to put debt on a downward trajectory. The fiscal consolidation effort is essential to safeguard Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors and face the long-term fiscal challenges of population aging. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate along the structural consolidation path. The long-term credibility and countercyclicality of fiscal policy could also be enhanced through a well-designed and stronger fiscal anchor. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">Future policies should protect the announced infrastructure investment increase. Public investment significantly decreased in 2015, and public-private partnerships are taking off slowly, whereas there is a clear need for infrastructure upgrades, in particular in transportation. Further improvements in the profitability of public enterprises and efforts to contain current public spending can create room for capital spending. </P><P MCID="15"> </P></page>

The high dollarization of deposits constrains the provision of peso credit and the effectiveness of monetary policy, and calls for higher scrutiny of banks’ credit risk exposures. A commitment to low inflation, supported by regulatory incentives such as reserve requirements differentiated by currency and initiatives to deepen local currency capital markets, can encourage a gradual de-dollarization of the economy. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">A tight monetary policy will be needed to help guide inflation toward the target range. Inflation has continuously surpassed the central bank’s target range for the past 6 years, temporarily exceeding single digit levels in mid-2016. The stance of monetary policy should be tightened further if and when activity recovers during 2017, to help sustain the disinflation process.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">A further reduction in inflation persistence, through the wage-setting process, will also be important. In this context, the ongoing move to wage increases that are stipulated in nominal terms is most helpful. Looking ahead, inflation inertia should be lowered further through steps toward the full elimination of backward inflation indexation. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Structural reforms in education and trade liberalization would help to deepen the social gains of the past decade and boost potential growth. Efforts to promote free trade within Mercosur, as well as to ensure market access to third countries are welcome. Education reform is also necessary to develop the skills that will strengthen Uruguay’s competitiveness in international markets. </P><P MCID="7">  </P></page>

Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, and a commitment to diversify its markets and products have allowed Uruguay to show resilience in the face of sharp recessions in its large neighbors. Nevertheless, economic growth slowed down in 2015 and 2016 while inflation remains above target. In 2017, an improving regional environment is expected to contribute to a modest further recovery, while inflation should slowly converge towards the target range. Given rising debt and high inflation, the room for more expansionary fiscal or monetary policy is limited. </P><P MCID="4">Main Policy Advice </P><P MCID="5"> The fiscal consolidation package for 2017 will support the downward trajectory of net debt and underpin Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors. The package should be implemented in a manner that supports the nascent recovery, including by allowing automatic stabilizers to work and by supporting infrastructure investment. </P><P MCID="6"> Over the medium term, stronger fiscal anchors could enhance the credibility of public finances, expanding the scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. </P><P MCID="7"> Tight monetary conditions are important to support the disinflation effort. High dollarization currently saps monetary policy transmission, and de-dollarization will require progress in reducing inflation and deepening domestic currency capital markets. Steps to reduce wage indexation further could bolster the disinflation process. </P><P MCID="8"> The flexible exchange rate remains key for absorbing external shocks. </P><P MCID="9"> Key policies to guarantee continued sustainable and inclusive growth also include education reform, and further international integration. </P><P MCID="10">Past advice. In recent Article IV consultations, there has been broad agreement between the authorities and Fund staff on the macroeconomic policy objectives. The authorities have sought to tackle inflation by reducing wage-price inertia in line with staff advice, and have generally maintained a tight monetary policy stance. The fiscal consolidation package follows long-standing staff advice to reverse the rise in public debt over the medium term. Broadly in line with staff recommendations on the importance of exchange rate flexibility, the authorities have allowed the exchange rate to adjust, albeit with some interventions to smooth movements in both directions. </P><P MCID="11"></P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">December 21, 2016 </P></page>

Uruguay is demonstrating resilience in the face of sharp recessions in its large neighbors. With both Argentina and Brazil in deep recession in 2016, Uruguay’s projected growth of 1.2 percent is a marked departure from yesteryears when growth remained close to the average of its two neighbors. Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, and a commitment to diversify its markets and products within the dominant agriculture and forestry sectors have increased Uruguay’s ability to withstand regional shocks. Going forward, in order to safeguard and advance the socioeconomic gains of the past decade, including reduced </P><P MCID="3">poverty and inequality, it will be critical for Uruguay to invest in structural reforms that enhance its growth potential and to reinforce its record of macroeconomic stability, creating space for countercyclical policies over the medium term.  </P><P MCID="4">RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">2.      The economic slowdown has bottomed out in 2016 and there are signs that the economy is on an incipient recovery path. Following a decade of expansion, growth came to a near halt in the final quarter of 2015 and first half of 2016, on the back of a difficult environment in the immediate region. The downturn involved a decline in exports, a sharp decline in private and public investment throughout 2015, and continued weak consumption (as rising inflation and exchange rate depreciation eroded current and expected real wages, and regional problems undermined confidence further). The downturn was especially pronounced in manufacturing and construction, while severe floods disrupted agricultural production in April. On the other hand, electricity generation expanded strongly as renewable energy projects came on stream. Confidence and activity rebounded in the third-quarter, buoyed by an appreciating exchange rate and prospects of improvements in Argentina and Brazil. Unemployment peaked at 8.8 percent in July 2016—the highest level since 2008—before trending down, and a negative output gap has opened up, estimated at ½ percent. </P><P MCID="7">3.      After weakening further against the U.S. dollar in nominal terms in early 2016, the Uruguayan peso stabilized and reversed course from April through October, broadly in line with regional peers (see Figure 1). Following a 23 percent depreciation in 2015, the peso depreciated by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar between January and March 2016. The weakness of the currency was driven by portfolio capital outflows, both on the asset and the liability side. From May onwards, the currency reversed course, resulting in a 6 percent appreciation in the year through October. The real effective exchange rate depreciated 4.5 percent over the course of 2015, but appreciated by </P><P MCID="8"></P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10">0501001502002501980198219841986198819901992199419961998200020022004200620082010201220142016Real Gross Domestic Product(Index number, 1980=100)UruguayArgentinaBrazilSource:IMF, World Economic Outlook.</P></page>

However, they have remained relatively compressed compared to those of regional peers. </P><P MCID="1">4.      The current account deficit is expected to remain around 2¼ percent of GDP in 2016. The deficit in 2015 was revised down from 3.5 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent, with a lower income balance (matched by lower FDI and other financial inflows). In 2016, the recession in Argentina and </P><P MCID="2">Brazil, and low prices of beef and wheat, have yielded a reduction in merchandise exports, but weak domestic consumption and investment have entailed an offsetting drop in merchandise and services imports. Meanwhile, overall terms of trade developments have been positive, largely due to lower oil prices. Faced with episodes of sharp exchange rate depreciation in early 2016, the central bank intervened in the FX market to support the peso, while purchasing foreign exchange in the face of strong appreciation pressures starting in August.1 In July, the government successfully launched a dual-tranche reopening of its dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2027 and 2050, raising U.S.$1.15 billion at historically low </P><P MCID="3">spreads (+205bp and +275bp respectively). In all, as of end-November, gross international reserves had fallen by U.S.$1.8 billion during the year-to-date, but remained well above prudential norms. </P><P MCID="4">5.      Despite the slowdown in activity, inflation persists at levels above the central bank’s target range. Driven by one-off increases in administered prices, and the further depreciation at the start of 2016, inflation rose to a high of 11 percent (y-o-y) in May, well above the 3–7 percent range (see Box 1). The subsequent weakening of the U.S. dollar has helped bring down inflation to 8.1 percent (y-o-y) in November. With increased administrative prices, and a spike in fruit and vegetable prices, headline inflation exceeded core inflation for the first time since early 2014. </P><P MCID="5">6.      Monetary policy remains relatively tight but its transmission has been constrained by the high dollarization and low level of peso credit in Uruguay. Against the background of rising inflation and declining demand for peso liquidity (as the depreciation triggered further currency substitution), the central bank tightened reserve requirements in April 2016 and lowered its reference range for narrow money (M1+) growth. 2 This range was lowered again in July, to  1–3 percent. Short term (one month) interest rates have continued to fluctuate between 11 and 13 percent, after peaking at 15 percent in April.  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">1 In September, the central bank also stopped its policy of offering the repayment of maturing government securities in U.S. dollars. </P><P MCID="7">2 In April, reserve requirements were raised, leading to their equalization for peso and dollar deposits, at 28 percent, whereas previously requirements were lower for peso deposits than for dollar deposits. </P><P MCID="8">22242628303234-1200-800-400040080012001600Jan-15Feb-15Mar-15Apr-15May-15Jun-15Jul-15Aug-15Sep-15Oct-15Nov-15Dec-15Jan-16Feb-16Mar-16Apr-16May-16Jun-16Jul-16Aug-16Sep-16Oct-16Nov-16BCU interventions(Millions of U.S. Dolllars)Change in reservesER (URY peso/USD, rhs)Sources:BCU and Fund staff calculations.</P></page>

Weak credit growth has been the result of tepid demand as well as supply constraints in Uruguay’s segmented financial market. While credit is already among the lowest in the region, at around 30 percent of GDP, real credit growth to both corporates and households has come to a virtual halt since 2015. SME credit, in particular, has been weak, with the real value of new loans </P><P MCID="1">contracting by 14 percent in the 12 months to June 2016, relative to a fall of 4 percent for larger corporates (chart).3 Given that the bulk of deposits are very short-term and U.S. dollar-denominated, banks have limited capacity to extend peso credit, particularly at longer tenors, in order to control balance sheet mismatches (see Box 2).4 The increase in reserve requirements and slowdown in the economy have exacerbated this trend, with currency substitution reducing banks’ peso liquidity and banks becoming more cautious to maintain the quality of their lending portfolios.  </P><P MCID="2">8.      In the context of the sharp economic slowdown, fiscal policy has remained broadly neutral during 2016, after the structural primary balance improved by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015.5 The authorities have maintained capital expenditures below the level indicated in the budget, thereby limiting the deficit increase. The public sector deficit is projected to worsen by 0.2 percentage points to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2016. The authorities have reaffirmed their objective to reach a 2.5 percent deficit by 2019, as announced in last year’s five-year budget.

Uruguay: Balance Sheet Analysis </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Uruguay has a small, segmented and highly dollarized but stable financial system. Deposit and credit dollarization (80 and 56 percent, respectively) are structurally high, with the two public banks mainly lending to households in pesos and private banks lending to corporates in dollars (see Lambert and Singh, 2016). Banks are highly liquid and keep their excess dollars either in reserve deposits at the central bank or in high quality assets abroad. Furthermore, banks have only a limited exposure to non-financial public sector (NFPS) debt whereas pension funds are the main holders of local-currency government debt. Foreign currency debt of the NFPS (52 percent of total) is mainly held by non-residents. Overall, the high share of equity in foreign financing (41 percent), the large (gross) international reserves of the central bank (29 percent of GDP), the high liquidity of the banks (liquid FX assets cover 2.5 times non-resident deposits) and the long average maturity of NFPS debt (14 years) contribute to the stability of the system. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Pockets of vulnerability exist, however, largely due to the high level of dollarization. In particular, the NFPS and the public sector as a whole have a (small) net short foreign currency position. While banks’ direct FX positions are well hedged, a number of corporate borrowers have net long FX positions, with around 30 percent of dollar lending going to non-tradable sectors. Lastly, households have a large net long FX position due to their preference for saving in dollars, exposing them to a peso appreciation risk. Exchange-rate pass through (notably for durable goods and real estate) provides a natural but only partial hedge. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15"> </P><P MCID="16"> </P><P MCID="17"> </P><P MCID="18"> </P><P MCID="19"> </P><P MCID="20"> </P><P MCID="21"> </P><P MCID="22"> </P><P MCID="23"></P><P MCID="24">Non-financial private sectorPublic sector (excluding public banks)Note: Arrows are proportional to the size of the exposure at end-2015.

GDP growth is projected to exhibit a modest further recovery to 1.4 percent of GDP in </P><P MCID="3">2017, as Brazil and Argentina emerge from recession. The external environment is expected to strengthen in 2017, together with private consumption (with the recovery of confidence). However, the planned contractionary fiscal stance may impose some drag on overall domestic demand, and production is expected to be dampened by extended oil refinery maintenance. Financial conditions are expected to remain broadly supportive, underpinned by accommodative global financial conditions, a stable banking system, and a small expansion in </P><P MCID="4">credit (though credit is not a principal source of financing and growth in Uruguay). Growth is projected to recover to a potential rate of 3 percent over the medium term, as domestic demand regains strength. Inflation is expected to slow and remain well below 9 percent in 2017, tapering to about 6 percent in the medium term, while the output gap gradually closes. The current account deficit is expected to remain at around 2¼ percent </P><P MCID="5">of GDP in 2017, with a pick-up in exports but higher oil prices, before edging up to 2½ percent in the medium-term as domestic demand recovers to match productive capacity.  </P><P MCID="6">11.      Financial stability risks seem limited. Staff stress tests confirm that credit and liquidity risks remain contained, and that the banking system could withstand even a large exchange rate shock that impaired loans to non-hedged borrowers. Non-performing loans, while historically very low, have doubled as a share of gross loans over the past two years when the economy weakened, but provisions for loan losses are high. After several years of decline, banks’ capital adequacy ratio has stabilized and provides adequate loss-absorption capacity. High structural costs, including labor costs, and recent changes in taxation however weigh on banks’ profitability. Banks’ liquidity is ample, supported by a funding model that relies for more than 85 percent on deposits (with a diversified depositor base), high reserve requirements, and a low level of credit. </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8">-3-2-101234-6-4-2024682005Q12006Q22007Q32008Q42010Q12011Q22012Q32013Q42015Q12016Q2Financial Conditions IndexSovereign spreadREERReal lending rateReal money growth (M1 plus)Real credit growthFCIGDP growth (q/q, in percent, right scale)LooserSource: IMF staff estimates.Note: The financial conditionindex provides a summary measure of the effect of financial variables on economic activity.The computation follows IMF Country Report 13/220.Tighter</P><P MCID="9">-5051020152016201720182019Contributions to Real GDP Growth(Percentage Points)Public consumptionPrivate consumptionPublic investmentPrivate investmentExportsImportsGDP at market pricesSources: BCU and IMF staff calculations.</P></page>

The risks to the outlook are both external and domestic.  </P><P MCID="1"> External risks. Although Uruguay’s regional economic ties have lessened, a slower-than-expected recovery in Argentina and Brazil could weigh on the economy, as could weaker-than-projected growth in China, which has become the most important destination for Uruguay’s merchandise exports. Non-resident deposits (mostly from Argentina) have declined to about 15 percent of total deposits, making a potential rapid withdrawal manageable in light of banks’ plentiful foreign currency liquidity. A tightening in global financial conditions could raise Uruguay’s cost of financing. The share of nonresident holdings of Uruguay’s public debt increased in 2015, mostly because of valuation effects, and at almost 58 percent, could also pose some external risk, although maturities are long. </P><P MCID="2"> Domestic risks. If the recovery in 2017 were weaker than expected, adhering to the planned fiscal consolidation plan would risk intensifying the slowdown, while a more expansionary fiscal stance would pose risks for debt. On the positive side, a potential large foreign investment (about 7 percent of GDP) in a third pulp mill presents upside risk to growth. </P><P MCID="3">13.      Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers and the flexible exchange rate should enable an orderly adjustment to shocks.  </P><P MCID="4"> Public sector financing risks are limited by sizeable liquid financial assets (about 6 percent of GDP) sufficient to cover debt service for 18 months, buttressed by the government’s access to contingent credit lines at international financial institutions of 4½ percent of GDP.  </P><P MCID="5"> The authorities’ willingness to allow the exchange rate to adjust in response to shifts in economic fundamentals has been key to absorbing external shocks.     </P><P MCID="6"> The BCU’s gross reserves are ample relative to standard prudential benchmarks, and stand at 140 percent of the upper bound of the ARA metric range for Uruguay, and could help cushion severe external shocks (see Annex I).  </P><P MCID="7">14.      The authorities emphasized the high degree of uncertainty in the international environment. They considered that Uruguay had managed the regional and global volatility well, as evidenced by ongoing economic growth and the continued positive differentiation of Uruguay relative to other emerging economies in financial markets. They noted that economic confidence had increased in recent months, supported by the government’s fiscal adjustment package and the fall of unemployment to its lowest level in a year in October. Looking ahead, they stressed the prospects fro a third paper pulp mill, which would entail the largest investment in the country’s history, as well as the positive outlook for increased investment via PPPs. In addition, Uruguay’s strong financial buffers would support the authorities in navigating possible further shocks.  </P><P MCID="8"> </P></page>

While the authorities avoided an overly contractionary policy stance in 2016, the room for countercyclical policies is limited. The fiscal package to reduce the general government’s deficit in 2017 is, by itself, projected to be procyclical, as output remains below potential.6 But delaying the structural fiscal consolidation could undercut the downward trajectory of net debt, jeopardize Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors, and potentially force an even more pro-cyclical tightening down the line. Given the weak economy and announced fiscal plans, the current monetary policy stance seems appropriate. However, with inflation still well above the upper-end of the target range, the authorities should stand ready to further tighten the monetary stance in 2017 as needed to safeguard the incipient reduction in inflation.  </P><P MCID="3">16.      A key challenge is to solidify the economic and social achievements of the past decade. Several key prerequisites are in place for boosting diversified and inclusive growth over the medium term, including a trusted public sector and a high degree of social stability. In other areas, however, more progress is needed. The government has started addressing gaps in transportation infrastructure. Skills formation needs to be fostered through education reform. And the provision of credit for private sector investment could be enhanced. In addition, while the current fiscal plans are sustainable, there is less clarity beyond the government term. Longer-term anchors would strengthen the credibility of economic policies, with positive effects on confidence, investment and growth.  </P><P MCID="4">A.   Implementing Fiscal Consolidation </P><P MCID="5">17.      The authorities’ fiscal consolidation path would put net debt on a downward trajectory. The government is expected to have avoided an overly pro-cyclical fiscal stance in 2016 by allowing the fiscal deficit to widen, while locking in the fiscal adjustment for 2017. This course of action was in line with earlier staff advice, that a strong commitment to the structural adjustment path for the primary balance would provide room for automatic fiscal stabilizers. The announced measures are expected to have a lasting effect on the primary balance. However, as the economy has slowed more than expected, fiscal settings have tightened more than originally expected.

The focus on fiscal consolidation is appropriate, although there is some space to respond to unanticipated shocks. Debt levels have risen sizably in recent years.

The announced structural consolidation, reducing the overall deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2019, will help maintain strong financial buffers. Moreover, the magnitude of the planned fiscal adjustment to stabilize and trim public debt relative to GDP appears realistic and, as fiscal credibility is preserved, there is space to allow fiscal stabilizers to operate. Looking beyond the government term (which runs through 2019), population aging will hit Uruguay before other countries in the region. The annual deficit of the defined-benefit pillar of the pension system (excluding special regimes) is projected to grow from around 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to more than 2 percent in 2050 and will require further reforms, including to limit the deficit of special pension regimes and reduce the risks coming from the indexation mismatch in the balance sheet of the public insurance company.8 </P><P MCID="1">19.      Improvements in the management and profitability of public companies are essential to strengthening the fiscal balance. Given the extensive role of public enterprises in Uruguay, improvements in their management and coordination are vital. The recent recapitalization of the state-owned oil distribution company, ANCAP, has strengthened its liquidity position. The government has contracted a hedge to limit the financial risk from a large oil price increase in world markets. The scope for passing through such increases into (administered) domestic fuel prices may be constrained in the near term, given the limited pass through of the prior decline in oil prices, which supports the restoration of ANCAP’s financial soundness. However, staff advised that, it would be useful to allow retail fuel prices to fully adjust with international oil prices as soon as feasible. Basing this on a transparent formula, would remove the risks to the budget inherent to the stabilization of domestic fuel prices and promote efficient fuel usage. Consideration could be given to implementing such an approach once the current oil price hedges expire to continue to ward off a re-emergence of quasi-fiscal risks. </P><P MCID="2">20.      Fiscal adjustment should be implemented in a manner that fosters economic growth as much as possible, which hinges on the execution of planned infrastructure investment. The 2017 tax package is expected to have a limited adverse effect on consumption, with an increase in personal income tax rates for middle-to-high-income earners, partly offset by lower VAT rates for electronic payments. On the expenditure side, a rationalization of the public wage bill and public enterprises’ expenditures will be important to ensure a durable consolidation, and would create space for higher multiplier spending on public investment. In particular, regional comparisons of infrastructure quality show a clear need for transportation infrastructure upgrades. Yet, while as part of the fiscal adjustment, public investment was lowered by 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, PPPs are only slowly taking off. The recent creation of a U.S.$ 350 million fund for infrastructure projects represents a promising step toward mobilizing financial resources for PPPs. According to the budget, between a fourth and a third of road and railroad infrastructure projects for the period </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="3">8 For defined-contribution pensions, this company bears the risk of any divergence between the wage growth (to which pensions are indexed) and the nominal interest rate. </P></page>

Beyond 2017, the authorities should assess the possible need for additional measures, on top of the built-in expenditure rationalization, to ensure the achievement of their medium-term fiscal targets. </P><P MCID="2">21.      Active debt management remains important to reduce financial vulnerabilities and interest payments. Financial markets have acknowledged Uruguay’s prudent debt management strategy that has lengthened the maturity of the debt, smoothed the redemption profile, and reduced interest cost by taking advantage of low international interest rates via </P><P MCID="3">successful dollar issuances and a recent interest rate swap operation (into Japanese Yen) with the World Bank. However, the share of debt denominated in foreign currency has increased again since 2013 as demand for peso assets weakened. Building on the recently created Public Debt Management Committee, the fiscal and monetary authorities could usefully foster the development of a more liquid and accessible local-currency bond market which would help lower the dollarization of public debt and further reduce external vulnerabilities. Useful steps could include the establishment of benchmarks for long-term peso debt instruments. </P><P MCID="4">22.      Stronger anchors could enhance the long-term credibility and counter-cyclicality of fiscal policy. The current rule, which limits the annual increase in net debt, has accommodated a strong increase in net debt during recent years.9 An overall debt limit could become part of the rule, as a reference for determining the annual limit on the increase in net debt. This would prevent the debt from reaching uncomfortable levels and strengthen confidence in the sustainability of Uruguay’s public finances. Furthermore, the annual limits on debt increases could adjust to the economic cycle, to permit the operation of fiscal stabilizers.  </P><P MCID="5">23.      The authorities confirmed their determination to lower the fiscal deficit to 2½ percent of GDP by 2019 to underpin fiscal sustainability. They expected that the fiscal package for 2017 would be sufficient to reach this target, in part because of its careful design to support economic growth. Indeed, they considered that overall fiscal policy would be supportive of growth in 2017 when taking into account all elements - the targeting of tax increases at higher income levels, the forthcoming expansion of infrastructure investments, including through PPPs, and the positive confidence effects of the adjustment. </P><P MCID="6"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="7">9 In particular, under the rule’s escape clauses, which were invoked in five of the past eight years. </P><P MCID="8">050010001500200025003000350001002003004005006007008009001000Dec-06Dec-08Dec-10Dec-12Dec-14Dec-16LA6: Emerging Market Bond Indices (Basis points) BRACHLCOLPERMEXURYVEN (RHS)ARG (RHS)Source: J.P.

Making Monetary Policy More Effective in Curbing Inflation </P><P MCID="1">24.      Inflation is projected to decline gradually, supported by a negative output gap and the ongoing wage discussions. The new wage agreements offer a valuable opportunity to achieve a lasting reduction in inflation, as they are set in nominal terms, which should reduce inflation persistence, and as they include nominal wage increases that are lower for each subsequent year, gradually reducing cost pressures. Current projections foresee inflation moving into the 3–7 percent target range by 2019. </P><P MCID="2">25.      Nonetheless, confronting inflation remains a priority, and is a precondition for de-dollarization which would support the transmission of monetary policy. Inflation in Uruguay has remained stubbornly high and above the level in other LA-6 countries. Lower inflation would protect the purchasing power of low-income households and increase scope to use monetary policy as a countercyclical tool. Moreover, securing the expected gradual decline in inflation would be especially important at this juncture, as surprise inflation could jeopardize sustained progress in reshaping the wage regime. Successfully bringing down inflation would also promote  de-dollarization that would in turn improve the transmission of monetary policy and facilitate a virtuous cycle of improved inflation performance. Experience in other countries shows that incentives to internalize the risks of dollarization, the development of capital markets in local currency, and the de-dollarization of deposits would all contribute to a decline in credit dollarization.10 The government’s ongoing financial market initiatives (see below) can further support progress in these directions. </P><P MCID="3">26.      Bringing inflation back to within the BCU’s target range requires an appropriately tight monetary policy. The change in the monetary policy framework in 2013––switching to an </P><P MCID="4">operational reference range for M1+ growth––and the progressive reduction in this reference range led to a rise in the interest rates and an overall tightening of monetary and financial conditions. In the face of inflation well above the central bank’s target, monetary conditions remained generally tight in 2016, aided by the appreciation of the exchange rate. Interest rates at maturities longer than three months stayed fairly stable, while short-term interest rates edged lower in the third quarter, and are below the level implied by a calibrated Taylor rule (Figure 3) and also below estimates of the neutral interest rate (see Box 3). </P><P MCID="5">Given a weak recovery and the procyclical fiscal tightening in 2017, the monetary stance remains sufficiently supportive of the disinflation effort. However, to bolster price stability and the credibility of monetary policy, the authorities should be ready to further tighten monetary conditions in 2017 if and when demand pressures pick up. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">10 See M.

This rate is not observable and can move over time, given changes in domestic and global macroeconomic conditions.

There is scope to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in the medium term. </P><P MCID="1"> Reduce inflation persistence further. New wage agreements typically include backward indexation after 12 months or more to offset possible real wage losses. 11 While a longer adjustment delay would be helpful in avoiding indexation in response to temporary price shocks (as the decline in inflation is expected to be gradual and irregular), staff recommended the full elimination of indexation provisions as expeditiously as possible.  </P><P MCID="2"> Strengthening the policy framework. Since 2013, the monetary authorities have applied the monetary framework in a flexible manner, repeatedly adjusting the reference range, and allowing interest rates to rise to higher levels. However, money demand has proven difficult to predict, and the growth rate for M1+ has undershot the reference range in eight out of the thirteen quarters of implementation. Staff reiterated its advice to closely monitor changes in money demand implied by the changes in deposit dollarization, in particular to avoid an unduly relaxed policy stance. The authorities could also usefully explore options to reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates, for example by using standing facilities to create an interest rate corridor, as a more stable short-term yield curve could strengthen the policy signal and serve as a reference for developing peso debt instruments and derivatives, lowering transaction costs and enhancing market liquidity. </P><P MCID="3">28.      The flexible exchange rate should remain the key mechanism to absorb external shocks. Exchange rate movements since early 2015 helped cushion the downturn and support competitiveness, as neighboring countries experienced similar depreciation pressures. Interventions in the exchange market should be used parsimoniously to counter disorderly market conditions, and not to counter trends driven by fundamentals.12 </P><P MCID="4">29.      The authorities emphasized that monetary policy had been kept tight, and that inflation had declined significantly since mid-2016. In particular, they noted that across the yield curve, real interest rates had remained strongly positive, including at short maturities. They explained that the monetary policy tightening in the first half of the year reflected a strong response to the rise in inflation and also responded to investors’ shift from pesos into U.S. dollars. In recent months, the BCU had accommodated the reversal in the demand for pesos. The authorities saw the evolution of the exchange rate as the main driver of inflation, and noted that the moderate real wages increases embedded in the new wage agreements, combined with the partial abandon of wage indexation on past inflation, was expected to support the decline in inflation over the coming years.

Promoting Financial Development and Maintaining Stability </P><P MCID="2">30.      The ongoing steadfast implementation of the 2014 Financial Inclusion Law promises to help increase peso deposits and competition in the peso market. In particular, the law requires employees to choose and designate a bank account on which their wage is paid, whereas that choice was previously made by the employer. Private banks can take advantage of the generalization of those payroll deposit accounts and financial incentives (lower VAT) for using electronic means of payment to increase their funding in peso. The development of the peso credit market—supported by such peso funding—could offer new income opportunities for banks, while the increased competition with the dominant public bank would lead to greater efficiency. </P><P MCID="3">31.      Market deepening and prudential policies to discourage foreign currency deposits and loans could support de-dollarization. The financing of public infrastructure projects could be designed to foster the development of new capital market instruments in peso, for example by marketing part of the securities issues by dedicated investments funds or trusts to retail investors. On the regulatory side, reinstating differentiated reserve requirements on peso and foreign-currency deposits and introducing asymmetric liquidity requirements between peso and foreign currency liabilities could encourage banks to favor peso deposits.13 </P><P MCID="4">32.      Supervision should remain alert to closely monitor banks’ exposures and contain stability risks. This monitoring will be facilitated by the implementation of the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2017, while the implementation of Basel III will strengthen the resilience of the system, through for instance the imposition of capital surcharges to the five domestic systemically important banks. The creation of new saving vehicles in peso would need to be accompanied by strong investor protection and efforts to improve financial education. </P><P MCID="5">33.      The authorities expressed satisfaction with the functioning of the financial system, advances in the supervisory framework, and the ongoing progress in financial inclusion.

Supporting Inclusive Growth </P><P MCID="1">34.      Social policies and transfers have played a significant role in reducing poverty and inequality. While income dispersion has decreased across Latin America over the last decade, Uruguay stands out as the country with the largest drop in the Gini coefficient between 2009 and 2014. This reflects both government guidelines to bolster low wages, and increased redistribution through income taxes and transfers. Recent IMF studies indicate that more equality can add to the long term growth potential.14 However, looking ahead, further redistributive policies may be constrained by their fiscal costs, and should also be designed with careful consideration for their potential impact on labor supply and incentives to seek training and enter the labor market. For example, the declining trend in the skill premium, especially between high and medium skilled workers, might reduce incentives toward human capital development––critical for productivity and innovation.  </P><P MCID="2">35.      Education reform is essential to sustain strong and inclusive growth. Despite a clearly higher teacher-to-student ratio, education outcomes are only marginally better than regional averages (Figure 6), leaving room for improving the efficiency of education spending. Education reform should aim at improving PISA scores and reducing the high dependence of student performance on socioeconomic conditions.  </P><P MCID="3">36.      Further increasing female labor force participation could help tackle the challenges </P><P MCID="4">from population aging. At around 55 percent, female labor force participation is fairly high in Uruguay compared to other Latin American countries. Nonetheless, it has remained about 17 percentage points below male participation. Women’s higher educational level would buttress the positive impact of raising female labor force participation. In addition to increasing the supply of affordable public child care, extending paternity leave could also help reduce the gender gap.  </P><P MCID="5">37.      New free trade agreements and progress in </P><P MCID="6">international integration can contribute to potential growth. As Uruguay’s export markets have diversified—reducing the share destined for Mercosur from 55 percent in 1998 to 21 percent by 2015—and given its focus on highly regulated and protected agricultural products, ensuring beneficial market access is critical. The recent trade agreement with Chile, which complements the 1996 agreement between Chile and Mercosur, and the conclusion of trade negotiations between Mercosur and the European Union should benefit Uruguay’s exports.

Uruguay is managing the deep recession in its large neighbors relatively well. After a marked slowdown, growth started to recover in the third quarter of 2016. Investment and consumption bottomed out through mid-2016, as inflation stabilized and the exchange rate stopped depreciating. The current account deficit has been cut in half since 2014, and international reserves have stabilized well above prudential norms. The real effective exchange rate appears aligned with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. </P><P MCID="5">40.      The external environment continues to present risks. Continued weakness in Argentina and Brazil, and a slowdown in global demand would adversely affect exports, while higher interest rates would raise funding costs and capital flow volatility would complicate the conduct of monetary policy. Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate and strong liquidity buffers would, however, support an orderly adjustment to shocks.  </P><P MCID="6">41.      The authorities have demonstrated a clear commitment to putting the public finances on a sustainable track. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2016 was a helpful response to moderate the sharper-than-expected slowdown. At the same time, the government has locked in tax increases for 2017, sustaining its commitment to bring the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2019 which is projected to put debt on a downward trajectory. The fiscal consolidation effort is essential to safeguard Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors and face the long-term fiscal challenges of population aging. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate along the structural consolidation path. The long-term credibility and countercyclicality of fiscal policy could also be enhanced through a well-designed and stronger fiscal anchor. </P><P MCID="7">42.      Future policies should protect the announced infrastructure investment increase. Public investment significantly decreased in 2015, and public-private partnerships are taking off slowly, whereas there is a clear need for infrastructure upgrades, in particular in transportation. Further improvements in the profitability of public enterprises and efforts to contain current public spending can create room for capital spending. </P><P MCID="8">43.      Lower inflation is a prerequisite for reducing dollarization. The high dollarization of deposits constrains the provision of peso credit and the effectiveness of monetary policy, and calls for higher scrutiny of banks’ credit risk exposures. A commitment to low inflation, supported by regulatory incentives such as reserve requirements differentiated by currency and initiatives to deepen local currency capital markets, can encourage a gradual de-dollarization of the economy. </P><P MCID="9"></P></page>

A tight monetary policy will be needed to help guide inflation toward the target range.

Uruguay—External Stability Assessment </P><P MCID="1">Uruguay’s current account deficit (CAD) has narrowed in 2015–16 on the back of slowing domestic demand and low oil prices, which overshadowed lower export receipts on account of the ongoing difficult external environment. The current account deficit improved by 2 percentage points of GDP, to 2.3 percent, in 2015 as the economy cooled down after several years of high growth, low fuel prices reduced the oil import bill, and the Montes del Plata pulp mill launched its first full year of production, supporting exports amidst the regional slowdown. The external services balance picked up slightly in 2015, albeit remaining far from the 3 percent of GDP average surpluses of 2009–12, as the surge of Uruguayan tourist spending in Argentina abated in the face of the economic slowdown and significant nominal depreciation of the Uruguayan peso against the U.S. dollar, while the latter prompted an uptick in Argentine visitors to Uruguay. In 2016, the CAD is estimated to have remained at about 2.2 percent of GDP, as the persistence of low international oil prices and further slowdown in domestic demand have lowered the import bill more than enough to offset the fall in exports from low commodity export prices and the recession in Argentina and Brazil. Furthermore, a record summer tourist season from Argentinians visiting Uruguay, and a further reduction in Uruguayan cross-border travelers, drew in net tourism receipts of ¾ percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2016—almost equivalent to total net receipts in 2015. Staff projects the CAD will remain at about 2.3 percent of GDP in 2017, as favorable terms of trade and a projected recovery in regional trade partners counteracts an expected pickup in domestic activity and oil prices.  </P><P MCID="2">FDI inflows have slowed since 2014, but continue to fully finance Uruguay’s current account deficit, while portfolio and other financial flows turned negative in 2015 and through mid-2106. Despite a late downward revision to inward FDI in 2015 (matched by a commensurate decrease in current account income payments), inflows of 2.4 percent of GDP were sufficient to fully finance the CAD. In the first half of 2016, despite slowing relative to 2015, FDI inflows were eight times the amount of the CAD. On the other hand, portfolio investment flows recorded a fifth consecutive quarter of net outflows in the second quarter of 2016, with non-resident sales of Uruguayan assets and resident purchases of foreign assets yielding net outflows of US$ 2.9 billion in </P><P MCID="3">20122013201420152016 1/Trade balance-4.6-2.4-1.6-0.50.5Exports19.317.818.117.016.8Imports23.920.219.717.516.3Fuel7.23.52.61.61.2Non-fuel16.816.717.115.815.1Capital3.03.43.73.43.1Consumption5.24.95.15.05.0Intermediary8.68.48.27.47.0Sources: Banco Central del Uruguay and Fund staff calculations.1/ 4 quarters through 2016Q2(in percent of GDP)Uruguay: Merchandise Trade Balance</P><P MCID="4">0.00.51.01.52.02.5020040060080010001200140020092010201120122013201420152016Q1Balance (percent of GDP, RHS)Argentina spending in UruguayUruguayan spending in ArgentinaUruguay: TourismBalance with Argentina(US$ millions)Sources: Banco Central del Uruguay</P><P MCID="5">-10-8-6-4-20246-10-8-6-4-202462008Q22010Q22012Q22014Q22016Q2Current Account(Rolling 4 quarters, in percent of GDP)GoodsIncomeTransfers and ServicesCurrent AccountSources:Haver Analytics, Central Bank data, and Fund staff calculations.</P></page>

This trend has reversed in the second half of 2016, with the Uruguayan Treasury’s issuance of a US$ 1.2 billion global bond, and significant portfolio capital inflows putting upward pressure on the peso. Other capital flows have been more volatile, with asset and liability outflows in the first quarter of 2016 followed by inflows of the same in the second, as the peso stabilized and reversed course.   </P><P MCID="1">After depreciating by 23 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2015, the peso fell another 8 percent in the first three months of 2016 in conjunction with the portfolio and other capital outflows mentioned above, and in line with the trend among emerging markets (EMs). From April onwards, however, the currency stabilized and has reversed course, wiping out the depreciation of early 2016, and recording a year-to-date appreciation of 6 percent as of end October. The central bank of Uruguay intervened in the foreign exchange market to buy pesos in early 2016, and thereafter to buy U.S. dollars, with the aim of curbing excessive volatility and disorderly market conditions in the relatively small domestic foreign exchange market. </P><P MCID="2">Staff estimates that the real effective exchange rate remains in line with fundamentals. The REER appreciated by 6 percent during January–September, 2016 (masking a real appreciation of 12 percent against Argentina, and a real depreciation of 11 percent against Brazil). The exchange rate is close to its estimated norm. The EBA current account model (based on results from October 2016) indicated a cyclically-adjusted current account norm of -3.6 percent of GDP, larger than the -2.1 percent of GDP cyclically-adjusted current account deficit (CAD) estimated for 2016, suggesting a 3½ percent undervaluation. The contribution of policy variables to the gap between the projected cyclically adjusted CAD and the norm was minimal, with the bulk owing to an unexplained residual.1 This large residual may partly be due to an underestimation by the model of the cyclical impact on Uruguay of a recession in its two large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil, causing an overestimation of the cyclically adjusted current account deficit norm. Calculations based on the EBA external stability approach, on the other hand, suggest a 2.8 percent overvaluation, as a CAD of -1.3 percent of GDP would be required to stabilize Uruguay’s net foreign assets to GDP ratio in the medium term, while staff’s medium-term CAD projection currently stands at -2½ percent of GDP.  </P><P MCID="3">External stability risks for Uruguay remain contained. As of end-October, gross reserves had declined by US$ 1.6 billion since the start of 2016 to US$ 13.97 billion. Despite this, reserves remain well above the upper bound of the IMF reserve adequacy metric range, and various other prudential benchmarks.

Furthermore, gross reserves excluding commercial banks’ reserves held at the BCU amount to US$ 7.5 billion, still within the adequacy range for total gross reserves. Given the solid level of reserves, and the financing of the CAD through relatively stable FDI inflows, external stability risks remain contained.

Uruguay—Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) </P><P MCID="1">Uruguay is one of very few countries to report debt figures on a consolidated basis for the whole public sector, excluding public commercial banks but including the central bank. This broad institutional coverage yields public gross financing needs and debt ratios that are higher than the DSA benchmarks for higher scrutiny countries.1 Under the baseline scenario, gross debt of Uruguay’s public sector is projected to stabilize around 64 percent of GDP in 2021. The long average maturity and favorable currency composition of the debt, as well as the high level of liquid financial assets of the public sector—24.8 percent of GDP at end-2015—mitigate short-term financing risks. </P><P MCID="2">The gross debt of the public sector has a wide coverage.

The stock of liquid assets of the public sector is computed as total gross public sector assets minus the reserves held by banks at the BCU against foreign currency deposits. This stock stood at 24.8 percent of GDP at end-2015. </P><P MCID="1">Baseline scenario </P><P MCID="2">Despite the slowdown, the low level of real interest rates implies a negative interest rate/growth differential in 2016, contributing to a decrease in the gross debt of the public sector. The appreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the second-half of 2016 is also expected to reduce gross debt. Net debt is however projected to increase in 2016, as the central bank’s reserves decrease and banks’ reserves at the BCU remain stable. Both gross and net debts increase again in 2017 and 2018, before stabilizing since the primary balance improves , as a result of the fiscal adjustment. Public gross financing needs decrease in 2017 before temporarily rising again over the medium term, as global interest rates increase and gross debt rises. </P><P MCID="3">Assuming that real GDP growth, real interest rates, and other identified debt-creating flows remain at the level projected for 2021, the debt-stabilizing primary balance is estimated at about ½ percent of GDP, below the projected medium term level of the primary balance. </P><P MCID="4">The baseline assumptions are broadly plausible. Staff forecast track record is not systematically biased, as reflected in projection errors generally not being consistently on one side. Although inflation forecasts have recently tended to underestimate actual inflation and growth forecasts have been slightly optimistic in the past two years, the median forecast errors over the period 2007–15 are broadly in line with those observed in other countries. The projected fiscal adjustment is consistent with experiences across surveillance countries. </P><P MCID="5">The fan charts show limited uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the symmetric fan chart, estimated at around 15 percent of GDP, illustrates a certain degree of confidence for equal-probability upside and downside shocks. </P><P MCID="6">Alternative scenario </P><P MCID="7">A “historical” scenario, assuming that the key macroeconomic variables behave as in the last decade, yields a downward-sloping debt path, since Uruguay experienced high growth rates and exchange rate appreciation as it recovered from the 2002 financial crisis. </P><P MCID="8">Vulnerability of the financing profile </P><P MCID="9">Public sector’s financing needs do not imply near-term vulnerabilities, although they exceeded the benchmark level of 15 percent of GDP in 2015. The elevated gross public financing needs reflect primarily the mostly short-term maturity of the central bank’s debt, which has declined sharply since then. The share of public sector debt held by non-residents and total external financing needs are slightly above their respective benchmarks, but refinancing risks are limited by the presence of high liquidity buffers, including the sizable liquid financial assets of the public sector and the access to </P></page>

These considerations also apply to the assessment of external debt sustainability (Annex IV). The share of short-term debt in total public debt increased by 2.1 percent in 2015, in part as the result of valuation effects, but the level of short term remains very low at 5.5 percent of GDP. </P><P MCID="1">Stress tests </P><P MCID="2">Debt dynamics are moderately sensitive to shocks. In a stylized downside scenario that combines a permanent 20 percent exchange rate depreciation (relative to the baseline) with a temporary drop in growth and primary balances, and a permanent increase in real interest rates, the gross debt ratio rises by about 18 percentage points over the five-year forecast horizon. Net debt rises by 13 percentage points in the same scenario. The sensitivity of net debt to exchange rate shocks is lower than that of gross debt, as the valuation effects on assets from exchange rate changes partially offset the valuation effects on foreign-currency denominated debt. Fan charts of the projected debt distribution confirm that debt dynamics are generally manageable under statistical distributions of combined shocks. Gross public debt would remain below 72 percent of GDP in 90 percent of the cases, while net public debt would remain below 56 percent of GDP under the combined shock scenario previously described.  </P><P MCID="3">  </P><P MCID="4">01020304050607080900102030405060708090201620172018201920202021Dynamics of Net Public DebtBaselineCombined Shock(in percent of GDP)Source: Fundstaff calculations.Note: Combined shock as described in the text.</P></page>

Initial State 2. Fiscal Space under the Baseline and Stress TestsBaselineStress testsDesk AssessmentGDP growth has slowed significantly since 2014. The output gap has turned negative and is expected to reach -0.6 percent of GDP.  The government avoided an overly pro-cyclical fiscal stance in 2016 by allowing the fiscal deficit to deepen, while locking in the required adjustment for 2017. Financing risk indicators exceed the standard benchmarks. The debt would exceed 70 percent of GDP under the combined stress scenario (see Annex II). Nonetheless, risks are mitigated by the presence of high liquidity buffers, including sizable liquid financial assets of the public sector and the access to contingent credit lines.Note: The inclusion of the central bank in the public accounts implies a higher level of public debt and higher financing needs.

Uruguay—External Debt Sustainability Analysis </P><P MCID="1">After averaging 46 percent of GDP during 2011–14, Uruguay’s gross external debt rose to 58 percent of GDP in 2015, mostly due to significant depreciation of the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. In 2016, gross external debt is projected to have decreased to 54 percent of GDP, aided by some nominal appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar. Under staff’s baseline scenario, gross external debt is projected to hold steady over the medium term, rising very slightly to 54¾ percent of GDP in 2021, largely due to exchange rate and price dynamics. Gross external financing needs (which averaged 14 percent of GDP from 2011–15) decreased to 9 percent of GDP in 2016, and are expected to moderate further, to 8¼ percent of GDP, in the medium term. </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Stress tests indicate that the standard growth and interest rate shocks would have a minimal impact on external debt. Shocks to the non-interest current account and a combined shock (to the real interest rate, growth and current account) would weigh more on external debt, albeit still moderately. Exchange rate shocks would pose the biggest risk to Uruguay’s external debt sustainability, as shown in the charts. Nonetheless, given Uruguay’s sizeable gross international reserves and liquidity buffers, risk to external debt sustainability remain limited.    </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5"> </P></page>

Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the program is expected to reach approximately US$1.8 billion, which is considered to be consistent with Uruguay’s five year budget. The program includes additional non reimbursable financing for technical assistance and analytical work. Approved lending under the previous Country Strategy (2010-2015) reached approximately US$1.9 billion in sovereign guaranteed loans2 and US$1 billion in non-sovereign guaranteed loans. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The objectives of the country strategy for 2016–2020 are to: (i) boost productivity and competitiveness by promoting innovation, improving productive infrastructure, and supporting an integrated and coordinated policy for international positioning; (ii) promote equity and social inclusion by strengthening the human capital and employability of the population, supporting health care reform, improving habitat, and supporting the early childhood and youth segments of the most vulnerable population groups; and (iii) strengthen public sector management by supporting greater efficiency in public institutions and strengthening urban and departmental management. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">As of October 31st 2016, the Bank’s portfolio in execution in Uruguay includes 37 sovereign guaranteed loans for US$2.1 billion. Of this total, 33 are investment loan operations totaling US$1.3 billion, and 4 are policy-based loans for US$800.8 million with a deferred drawdown option. The main sectors comprising the active public sector portfolio are: export and investment promotion (27%); public management and finance (16%); water, sanitation, and solid waste (14%); energy (14%); urban development and security (8%); transportation (7%); science and technology (2%); agribusiness (3%); education and job training (5%); and social protection (4%). The active private sector portfolio is composed of 22 loans totaling US$449.1 million, primarily concentrated in the energy (48%) and agribusiness sectors (46%). </P><P MCID="13">Financial Relations With the Inter-American Development Bank1 </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16">(In millions of U.S. dollars) </P><P MCID="17">Total outstanding loans: US$1,728 (As of November 30, 2016) </P><P MCID="18"> </P><P MCID="19"></P><P MCID="20">Loan Transactions </P><P MCID="21"> </P><P MCID="22"></P><P MCID="23"> </P><P MCID="24">2005 </P><P MCID="25">2006 </P><P MCID="26">2007 </P><P MCID="27">2008 </P><P MCID="28">2009 </P><P MCID="29">2010 </P><P MCID="30">2011 </P><P MCID="31">2012 </P><P MCID="32">2013 </P><P MCID="33">2014 </P><P MCID="34">2015 </P><P MCID="35"></P><P MCID="36">Disbursement </P><P MCID="37">242.3 </P><P MCID="38">114.8 </P><P MCID="39">112.9 </P><P MCID="40">337.2 </P><P MCID="41">477.3 </P><P MCID="42">54.3 </P><P MCID="43">138.2 </P><P MCID="44">121.6 </P><P MCID="45">195.9 </P><P MCID="46">166.3 </P><P MCID="47">182.6 </P><P MCID="48"></P><P MCID="49">Amortization </P><P MCID="50">220.0 </P><P MCID="51">519.6 </P><P MCID="52">133.8 </P><P MCID="53">140.0 </P><P MCID="54">162.0 </P><P MCID="55">465.1 </P><P MCID="56">115.4 </P><P MCID="57">120.7 </P><P MCID="58">591.7 </P><P MCID="59">99.2 </P><P MCID="60">110.1 </P><P MCID="61"></P><P MCID="62">Net Loan Flows </P><P MCID="63">22.3 </P><P MCID="64">-404.8 </P><P MCID="65">-21.0 </P><P MCID="66">197.2 </P><P MCID="67">315.2 </P><P MCID="68">-410.8 </P><P MCID="69">22.8 </P><P MCID="70">0.8 </P><P MCID="71">-395.8 </P><P MCID="72">67.1 </P><P MCID="73">72.4 </P><P MCID="74"></P><P MCID="75">Source: Inter-American Development Bank. </P><P MCID="76">1/ Only loans with sovereign guarantee are considered. </P><P MCID="77"> </P><P MCID="78"></P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="79">2 This includes US$366 million approved under the Reallocation Program and US$50 million from the China Cofinancing Fund. </P><P MCID="80"></P></page>

Most affected area is national accounts. </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10">National accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005) and adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993. However, national accounts statistics still have some shortcomings: limited coverage of the enterprise survey, partial update of business register, poor quality source data for some components of GDP, inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts.  Long-time series are not available on the BCU website. There is no regular schedule for updating the base year of the national accounts. The causes of the current revisions to the quarterly national accounts are not explained to users. For the national accounts there is a need to plan adoption of the 2008 SNA and updating of the base year.  </P><P MCID="11"></P><P MCID="12">Prices: The new base period for the consumer price index is December 2010 = 100. The CPI has national coverage and includes more than forty thousand price quotations. It does not cover either the implicit rent or the net acquisitions of owner-occupied dwellings. For the CPI, reselection of the sample of detailed products has not been done for an extended period. The base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Producer price indices (March 2010 =100) for national products have been recently disseminated. The PPI does not cover utilities, construction, business and other services and exported output. For both the CPI and </P><P MCID="13">PPI, statistical outputs/intermediate results are not validated with available information from alternative sources. The CPI and PPI would benefit from a more regular and frequent schedule of weight updates. </P><P MCID="14"></P><P MCID="15">Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems with the timeliness of the data for local governments. Information on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector, but no information is reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The information reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on revenue and expense for the consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for local governments have not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt). </P><P MCID="16"></P><P MCID="17">Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance with the IMF's </P><Span MCID="18">Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).</Span><P MCID="19"> The authorities report monetary data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations (OFCs) using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs).
