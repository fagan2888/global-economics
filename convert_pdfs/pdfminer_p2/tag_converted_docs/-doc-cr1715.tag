Nonhydrocarbon growth slowed from 5 percent to an estimated 3½ percent in 2015, as higher uncertainty weighed on consumption. Notwithstanding an improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan (DP), available indicators point to a further modest softening in nonoil growth this year. Inflation, which has been hovering at around 3 percent, is set for an uptick to about 3½ this year, reflecting the recent gasoline price increases. </P><P MCID="9">Notwithstanding efforts to contain government spending, the fiscal and external accounts have deteriorated markedly and budget financing needs have emerged. The authorities’ principal measure of the fiscal balance—which excludes mandatory transfers to the Future Generations Fund (FGF) and investment income and better reflects the government’s gross financing challenge—has swung into a large deficit (17½ percent of GDP in 2016/17). Even when including investment income and before transfers to the FGF, fiscal surpluses have vanished. </P><P MCID="10">The financial sector has remained sound and credit conditions favorable. As of June 2016, banks featured high capitalization (capital adequacy ratio of 17.9 percent), robust profitability (return on assets of 1 percent), low nonperforming loans (ratio of 2.4 percent), and high loan-loss provisioning (206 percent coverage). Bank liquidity has been comfortable. Credit to the private sector has been increasing at a solid pace, driven mainly by installment loans.  </P><P MCID="11"></P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination"></Artifact><P MCID="12">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

The fiscal and external positions have deteriorated significantly and nonhydrocarbon growth has moderated—from 5 percent in 2014 to about 3¼ percent this year—as a result of the drop in oil prices. However, large financial buffers and low debt provide policy space to implement the necessary fiscal consolidation gradually while increasing public investment to support growth. Against this backdrop, the fiscal and external positions are projected to improve as adjustment proceeds and oil prices recover somewhat, and nonoil growth is projected to regain momentum to about 4 percent over the medium term supported by a continued improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan. The main risk to the outlook stems from a further sustained decline in oil prices. Slow project implementation, more volatile global financial conditions and spillovers from heightened regional security risks could also affect economic prospects.  </P><P MCID="3">Nonetheless, “lower-for-longer” oil prices call for steadfast implementation of reforms. The government’s six-pillar reform strategy is rightly focused on reforming public finances and promoting a greater role for the private sector in generating growth and jobs for nationals. Efforts to streamline current spending, including the recent gasoline and utility price reforms, and measures to facilitate business licensing are steps in the right direction. Maintaining consensus in favor of economic transformation and sustaining the reform momentum is paramount for the success of the strategy.  </P><P MCID="4">Fiscal reforms should focus on addressing underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and be designed so as to minimize any dampening impact on growth. Gradual removal of fuel and electricity subsidies and control of the wage bill through a well-designed reform that avoids significant upfront costs would help reduce budget rigidities, while the introduction of the VAT and business profit tax and the repricing of government services would go a long way in diversifying revenue away from oil. These fiscal reforms should be designed and sequenced with a view to striking a balance between generating fiscal savings in line with intergenerational equity levels and mitigating the drawbacks of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. A comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework based on a top-down approach and articulated around clearly-specified medium-term fiscal objectives would help guide the consolidation plans and reduce implementation risks.   </P><P MCID="5">Fiscal financing options should be assessed within a comprehensive asset/liability management framework with due consideration to macro-financial linkages. Consistent with the government’s current approach, a balanced financing mix that combines continued drawdown of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance and some external borrowing would mitigate potential crowding out of private sector credit while maintaining a high level of liquid buffers. </P></page>

In light of the potential risks from a sustained further decline in oil prices and given the financial sector risks inherent to a largely undiversified economy, the CBK initiatives to enhance financial sector surveillance are welcome. A formal framework for operationalizing macro-prudential measures, reforms to facilitate debt recovery, developing a liquidity forecasting framework, and strengthening the crisis management framework, including by introducing a special resolution regime for banks and a deposit insurance mechanism, would help further enhance financial sector resilience and ensure orderly resolution of banks in the event of stress.   </P><P MCID="2">The peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies is appropriate and can be further underpinned by fiscal adjustment. The peg has provided an effective nominal anchor. A moderate current account gap can be largely closed by increasing fiscal savings as recommended over the medium term.  </P><P MCID="3">Labor market reforms and efforts to promote the role of the private sector are important to foster diversification and boost job creation for nationals. Better aligning labor market incentives is necessary to encourage nationals to take on private sector jobs and private firms to create opportunities for them. Greater use of privatization and partnerships with the private sector will help boost productivity, private sector investment and job creation for nationals. Relying on stronger legal and institutional frameworks that foster competition and reduce hidden costs and contingent liabilities for the government is important for the success of this strategy. This should be combined with further steps to improve the business environment, including reforms to facilitate access to land and finance, reduce the burden of administrative procedures and excessive regulations, foster competition, and facilitate SMEs’ access to finance </P><P MCID="4"> </P></page>

With large financial buffers, low debt, and a well-capitalized financial sector, the country is well positioned to face “lower-for-longer” oil prices. Nonetheless, fiscal and external balances have weakened and nonoil growth has softened somewhat. The main policy priorities are to sustain reforms to gradually raise fiscal savings, reduce susceptibility to oil price cycles, and boost private sector growth and job creation.  </P><P MCID="5">Outlook and risks. Nonoil growth is expected to gain momentum over the medium term, supported by continued improvement in project implementation under the Kuwait Development Plan. The fiscal position is projected to improve modestly, but financing needs after transfers to the Future Generation Fund will remain large. The main risk to the outlook is a further sustained drop in oil prices. Setbacks on fiscal consolidation measures would lead to higher financing needs. Slower project implementation under the development plan could weaken growth. </P><P MCID="6">Macroeconomic policies. Building on recent increases in energy prices and spending restraint, the authorities should advance reforms to underpin gradual fiscal consolidation. These could include measures to raise nonoil revenues, further energy price reforms, and continued spending restraint, while allowing for higher growth-enhancing capital outlays. Strengthening the fiscal framework would underpin consolidation and limit implementation risks. Developing a comprehensive asset-liability management framework would help guide investment and borrowing decisions.  </P><P MCID="7">Financial sector. Banks are in a strong position to weather the challenges of lower oil prices. The Central Bank of Kuwait’s enhanced surveillance is geared toward early identification of financial stability risks. Possible steps to further strengthen financial sector resilience include establishing a formal framework for macro-prudential measures, developing a liquidity forecasting framework, and strengthening the resolution and crisis management framework.  </P><P MCID="8">Private-sector led growth and economic diversification. Advancing labor market, business climate, and other reforms to foster private sector development and diversification will be key to boost job creation for nationals.  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">December 16, 2016 </P></page>

The government has announced a comprehensive agenda—the six-pillar reform strategy (Box 1)—to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment, encourage private sector development and diversification, and create jobs for the growing national labor force. Initial steps have been taken, most recently to advance energy pricing reforms and to ease registration and licensing procedures (Annex I), and several other measures are under preparation. In the wake of the recent parliamentary elections—which led to a significant turnover of National Assembly members—the outgoing Prime Minister was reappointed to form a cabinet. The new government has reaffirmed the authorities’ commitment to reforms. Steady implementation—a must to deliver concrete results over the next few years—will require building consensus in favor of economic transformation.  </P><P MCID="7">RECENT MACRO</P><P MCID="8">-</P><P MCID="9">FINANCI</P><P MCID="10">AL DEVELOPMENTS</P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">3.      Economic activity in the nonoil sector has continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace, reflecting the impact of lower oil prices. Nonhydrocarbon growth slowed from 5 percent to an estimated 3½ percent in 2015, as higher uncertainty weighed on consumption. Notwithstanding an improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan (DP), available indicators point to a further modest softening in nonoil growth this year. However, with oil production recovering after three consecutive years of decline,1 overall growth is on track to reach about 3½ in 2016 (Figure 1). Inflation, which has been hovering at around 3 percent, is set for an uptick to about 3½ this year, reflecting the recent gasoline price increases. </P><P MCID="13">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="14">1 The drop in hydrocarbon production was mainly due to the temporary closure of a neutral zone oil field and technical factors.  </P><P MCID="15">KuwaitBahrainOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUAE020406080100102030405060Oil Exports in percent of total exportsOil GDP in percent of total GDPDependence on Oil: Kuwait and GCC(2015)Size of the bubble indicatesthe financial buffers (SWF assets and reserves) in percent of total GDPSource: IMFstaff calculations.</P><P MCID="16"></P><P MCID="17"></P></page>

Kuwait’s Six-Pillar Reform Strategy </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">In early 2016, the government announced a comprehensive reform strategy to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment, encourage private sector development and diversification, and create jobs for the growing national labor force. The strategy is organized around six-pillars:   </P><P MCID="3"> Rationalizing government expenditure and increasing nonoil revenue to reduce the budget deficit over the medium term. The authorities plan to raise nonhydrocarbon revenue (by introducing a VAT and a business profit tax and raising the price of some government services) and curtail expenditure through rationalization of government agencies’ spending, further advancing subsidy reforms and reforming the pay structures.  </P><P MCID="4"> Modernizing the role of the state. The government is to refocus on ensuring a conducive regulatory and business environment and encouraging market forces.  </P><P MCID="5"> Promoting private sector development, through privatization of public enterprises, enhanced use of partnerships with the private sector, and support for small- and medium-sized enterprises. </P><P MCID="6"> Encouraging citizens’ participation in privatized enterprises and PPP projects.  </P><P MCID="7"> Making the labor market and civil service more efficient. Initiatives in these areas will include reforms of public sector wages and performance evaluation systems and steps to improve labor force planning and upgrade skills through educational reforms (including enhanced vocational training). </P><P MCID="8"> Promoting supporting legislative and institutional reforms to enhance public financial management, strengthen tax administration capacity, develop financial markets, and improve the business climate. </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">4.      Notwithstanding efforts to contain government spending, the fiscal and external accounts have deteriorated markedly. As a result of dwindling oil revenues, the authorities’ principal measure of the fiscal balance—which excludes mandatory transfers to the Future Generations Fund (FGF) and investment income and better reflects the government’s gross financing challenge—2 has swung into a large deficit (17½ percent of GDP in 2015/16). Even when including investment income and before transfers to the FGF, fiscal surpluses have vanished (text table). The underlying (nonoil) fiscal position has nevertheless improved over the past two years, reflecting a decline in the subsidy bill (Figure 2), non-recurrence of one-off spending, and efforts to curtail current expenditure.

Overall, real GDP growth would reach about 3 percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to increase to 4½ percent in 2017, reflecting energy prices increases in 2016–17, before easing gradually. Higher hydrocarbon exports will lift the current account surplus above 10 percent of GDP by 2021. The authorities were broadly in agreement with staff’s assessment of the macroeconomic outlook, but noted inflation could be lower next year based on the experience of other GCC countries.  </P><P MCID="1">9.      Kuwait’s fiscal position is projected to improve modestly, but financing needs after transfers to the FGF will remain large. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes oil prices will gradually recover to some $60 by 2021. It takes into account the fiscal impact of the measures recently enacted but does not factor in the government’s planned fiscal reforms that have yet to be implemented. Under this scenario, the fiscal balance (government definition) is projected to decline from about 17½ percent of GDP this year to 13 percent of GDP over the medium term, and cumulative gross financing needs would amount to about KD 35 billion over the next 6 years. These are assumed to be covered by a continued drawdown of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance to avoid crowding out private sector investment, and some external borrowing. The overall fiscal balance (before transfers to the FGF and including investment income) would post surpluses. </P><P MCID="2">10.      This macro-fiscal environment is expected to remain broadly supportive of financial stability and credit growth. Growth-enhancing capital expenditures will support bank profitability and internal capital generation. Although there are downside risks to asset quality, loss absorption buffers are high.

The main risk to the outlook is a further sustained drop in oil prices, which would lead to higher financing needs and could set in motion unfavorable macro-financial dynamics. Large fiscal deficits (Figure 6) would raise the gross financing requirement over the medium term (text table). Although the government’s strong credit rating (AA) would enable it to tap international markets, investors’ appetite for GCC bonds could decline in case of large regional financing needs.

Staff and the authorities’ banking stress tests indicate that the financial system is resilient to severe credit and liquidity shocks.5 Nonetheless, a protracted period of lower oil prices—should it affect deposit growth, nonoil activity, stock market performance or real estate prices—could also heighten liquidity and credit risks (Box 3) and, in turn, credit and economic activity.  </P><P MCID="1">12.      Kuwait is also exposed to a number of other domestic and external risks (Annex III). Setbacks on fiscal consolidation measures would lead to higher financing needs. Slower project implementation under the development plan could weaken growth. While the country is only moderately exposed to regional spillovers, heightened security risks could affect investor confidence. More volatile global financial conditions could raise funding and market risks. In addition to the impact they could have through oil prices and financial markets conditions, significant changes to the post-election U.S. economic outlook could affect Kuwait through the exchange rate and interest rates. For example, a stronger U.S. dollar and a more rapid normalization of policy rates, may entail tighter monetary conditions given the Kuwaiti dinar peg. Outward spillovers, mainly through Kuwait’s contribution to global oil supply, investments abroad and remittances, are expected to be limited.  </P><P MCID="2">Financing Needs Under Different Scenarios, 2015–22 </P><P MCID="3">(In percent of GDP) </P><P MCID="4"></P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="9">5 See also “The resilience of the banking system to macroeconomic shocks in Kuwait” in IMF Country Report No. 15/328; “Macro-financial linkages and resilience of the financial sector” in accompanying Selected Issues Paper; and </P><Span MCID="10">2015 Financial Stability Report</Span><P MCID="11">. </P><P MCID="12">2015/162016/172017/182018/192019/202020/212021/22Cumulative 2016/17-21/22Percent of GDPOverall balance0.00.75.05.24.53.82.5Actual balance (excluding inv. income and 10 percent of revenue)-17.5-17.3-12.6-11.7-12.0-12.1-12.8Non-oil balance (% of non-oil GDP)-88.3-85.7-84.3-82.0-80.4-78.8-77.2Gross financing in KD billion6.06.04.94.95.45.86.533.5Domestic-0.32.41.01.01.11.21.48.2External 0.01.81.51.01.01.01.07.3Drawdown of GRF6.31.92.42.93.23.64.218.1Public debt 1/4.712.018.223.026.329.131.8Stock of the GRF assets 1/ 2/144.3144.9125.1112.4100.688.676.8Current Account balance 1/ 2/5.24.59.39.89.810.310.2Overall balance0.0-2.2-6.3-6.3-7.1-7.9-9.3Actual balance (excluding inv income and 10 percent of revenue)-17.5-20.3-24.2-23.1-23.2-23.1-23.5Non-oil balance (% of non-oil GDP)-88.3-85.1-82.1-80.0-78.5-77.0-75.5Gross financing in KD billion6.06.98.48.69.39.910.853.9Domestic-0.32.41.01.01.11.21.48.2External 0.01.81.51.01.01.01.07.3Drawdown of GRF6.32.75.96.67.17.78.538.5Public debt 1/4.712.622.229.033.938.142.0Stock of the GRF assets 1/2/144.3142.5127.6103.881.359.338.2Current Account balance 1/2/5.24.5-1.6-1.3-1.3-0.9-0.9Sources: IMF staff estimates.1/ It is referring to calendar years.2/ The stock of General Reserve Fund  (GRF) assets are staff estimates and projections.Scenario I: Baseline Scenario II: Lower oil price (25 percent  less than baseline)</P></page>

Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to further contain the wage bill as part of the medium-term fiscal effort. The authorities’ proposed wage reform is intended to simplify and harmonize the wage structure and centralize wage policy decisions. In view of the already high total </P><P MCID="1">government wage bill—including in comparison with peers—they acknowledged the need to design the reform so as to ensure that the overall wage bill does not rise further.10 In this context, staff stressed the need to minimize initial costs of moving to the new wage grid, including through offsetting savings in allowances and bonuses. The authorities also concurred with staff’s recommendation to design the reform so as to allow for flexibility in setting wage increases and better control future wage growth. Over time, this would help reduce </P><P MCID="2">the wage gap with the private sector and nationals’ reservation wages, enhance private sector competitiveness, and facilitate economic diversification. While the authorities generally agreed with staff’s recommendation to limit employment growth going forward and communicate early on about its objectives to help reset expectations, they stressed this would need to be done while promoting private sector job creation for nationals.  </P><P MCID="3">19.      Further streamlining other current spending would create space for higher growth-enhancing investment. Staff highlighted that containing transfers to enterprises and households and goods and services would contribute to the adjustment effort, while allowing for higher capital outlays to mitigate the contractionary impact of fiscal adjustment. The authorities concurred and noted their ongoing efforts to streamline nonessential current expenditure. Indeed, spending on goods and services and transfers declined by 2 percent in 2015/16, compared to annual growth of about 13 percent on average in the preceding 5 years. Since public investment management reforms are key to improve implementation capacity and efficiency, staff welcomed the efforts underway to better prioritize projects through strengthened appraisal processes, with emphasis on encouraging diversification and employment opportunities for nationals. Systematic ex-post evaluation and effective implementation of the anti-corruption framework will also be important.  </P><P MCID="4">20.      A medium-term fiscal framework is needed to guide fiscal consolidation and reduce implementation risks. Staff welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen budget planning, including the move from annual incremental budgets to medium-term budgets starting in FY2017/18 and the planned introduction of three-year expenditure ceilings. It stressed that these reforms should take place within the context of a comprehensive medium-term framework, guided by an overarching long-term fiscal policy objective (for example based on intergenerational equity considerations) and setting a consistent path for an intermediary target (a nonoil fiscal balance </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">10 The authorities envisage a standardization of the wage structure that could entail upfront costs of up to 1 percent of 2015 GDP. </P><P MCID="6">024681012141618 - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100KuwaitSaudi ArabiaOmanBahrainQatarAverage (exlUAE)In percent of GDPIn percent of total employmentGCC Nationals' Empolyment and Public Wages , 2015 1/Share employed in public sectorPublic sector wage bill (RHS)Sources: Country authorities.1/ Data is not available for UAE.</P></page>

The authorities agreed and noted that the Ministry of Finance’s macro-fiscal unit was well positioned to help in this regard. In this context, there was agreement about the importance of developing a top-down approach, strengthening budget processes—including by reducing the fragmentation of the investment budget—and expenditure control mechanisms, and developing reporting and accountability mechanisms.  </P><P MCID="1">21.      Borrowing and investment decisions should be guided by a comprehensive asset-liability management strategy that takes into account macro-financial implications. The authorities’ short-term plans entail a combination of (i) domestic and external borrowing; (ii) a drawdown of GRF assets; and (iii) transfers to the FGF to be invested in higher-yielding assets. At the moment, higher returns on FGF assets, low borrowing costs, and the need to develop debt markets provide support for this approach. Staff recommended that, over time, the appropriate mix between the various borrowing and investment options be guided by a systematic assessment of their relative costs and benefits, including that of maintaining liquid buffers as insurance against shocks. The macro-financial impact of these options should also be assessed carefully (Box 2 and accompanying Selected Issues Paper), taking into consideration the implications of building up debt and the impact of borrowing on domestic liquidity, credit, and central bank reserves. In this regard, coordination with the CBK will remain important. Staff encouraged the authorities to sustain their balanced approach to fiscal financing over the medium-term. The authorities agreed this would help mitigate potential negative macro-financial implications and support the development of domestic debt markets.  </P><P MCID="2">22.      Staff and the authorities concurred that the debt issuance program would benefit from a further strengthening of the institutional and legal frameworks and increased transparency. The establishment of a high-level Debt Management Committee (DMC), backed by the creation of new debt-management unit (DMU), provides a strong basis for coordination across relevant government bodies. Further efforts are ongoing to clarify responsibilities and fully operationalize the DMU. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to address legal hurdles that constrain the amounts and type of instruments that can be issued, including Sukuk, thereby helping broaden the investor base. It recommended putting in place a medium-term debt strategy and maintaining a debt ceiling to spur fiscal discipline. The authorities recognized that improved disclosure of the government’s assets and liabilities, more comprehensive fiscal accounts, and improved timeliness of intra-year budgetary execution data would help strengthen investor confidence and reduce borrowing costs. Promoting a deep and liquid government debt market that facilitates private debt issuance is important to foster capital market and private sector development. Introducing regular market-based auctions, communicating transparently, and developing secondary markets—an agenda the authorities intend to tackle over time—would help in this regard.  </P><P MCID="3">  </P></page>

Budget Financing Options and Potential Macro-Financial Implications1 </P><P MCID="2"></P><P MCID="3">With a few exceptions, Kuwait has not had to borrow for decades, and its domestic debt markets have therefore remained underdeveloped. The country has recorded budget surpluses since the early 1980s, with the exception of first half of the 1990s.  </P><P MCID="4">With the emergence of budget deficits and financing needs since 2015/16, the government has had to reassess its financing strategy. The current plans entail a combination of (i) domestic and external borrowing; (ii) a drawdown of GRF assets; and (iii) continued mandatory transfers to the FGF to be invested in higher-yielding assets. The government has also taken initial steps to develop its debt management capacity by establishing a high level debt management committee, supported by a newly-created debt management unit (DMU).  </P><P MCID="5">Choosing the financing mix in the context of a comprehensive asset and liability management (ALM) framework is important. This entails basing decisions not only on the cost of borrowing versus return on assets, but also the financial characteristics of sovereign’s assets and liabilities to limit potential mismatches and risks, including interest rate and exchange rate risks. The tradeoffs should also be viewed from a self-insurance perspective, where higher borrowing costs can be seen as an insurance premium against possible liquidity shocks. Increased formal coordination between the ministry of finance, the CBK, KIA, and other relevant agencies, and improvements in the timeliness of published fiscal accounts and the disclosure of government assets would help ensure effective asset and liability management. </P><P MCID="6">Financing mix decisions should also be guided by a broader set of institutional, financial and macroeconomic considerations. These include macroeconomic conditions, absorptive capacity and degree of domestic financial market development, and institutional capacity, including of managing debt. The potential macro-financial consequences of the various financing options, for example on banks’ liquidity, private sector credit, and central bank reserves should be carefully assessed. In this context, external borrowing would help mitigate pressures on domestic liquidity and support central bank reserves.2 Establishing risk-free government yield curves through domestic and external borrowing would also help develop the private debt market.  </P><P MCID="7">Effective debt management and development of the debt market require sound institutional and legal frameworks. To this end, a formal debt management strategy with clear objectives and division of responsibilities among concerned agencies, operationalizing the DMU, developing cash management capacity, and moving towards a market-based auction system that allows for price discovery would be important. Other key steps include broadening the investor base (to include Islamic banks, investment companies, the pension fund and insurance companies), addressing legal constraints to government borrowing and sukuk issuance, and developing the secondary markets to facilitate the development of financial markets for corporates. </P><P MCID="8">________________________________ </P><P MCID="9">1 See accompanying Selected Issues Paper “Budget Financing Options and Potential Macro-Financial Implications” </P><P MCID="10">2 Financing through drawing assets in the GRF or external borrowing would result in equivalent transfers of foreign exchange to the government’s account at the CBK. </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Staff shared the authorities’ view that the peg to a basket remains appropriate for the Kuwaiti economy, as it provides an effective nominal anchor. The authorities are fully committed to the current exchange rate regime. The modest depreciation against the dollar since mid-2014 (7 percent) on account of having a basket rather than dollar peg has been helpful during a period of dollar strength. Staff’s external sector assessment (Annex VI) suggests a moderate current account gap, the bulk of which would be closed by increasing fiscal savings as recommended over the medium term. Staff noted that over the longer term, as the economy diversifies, the benefits of greater exchange rate flexibility may increase.  </P><P MCID="1">B.   Safeguarding financial stability </P><P MCID="2">24.      The CBK has been proactive in strengthening regulatory oversight and mitigating financial stability risks. Banks are under Basel III regulations for capital, liquidity, and leverage. Macro-prudential measures—to prevent excessive debt build up by households and limit banks’ exposure to real estate and equities—are being enforced to minimize systemic risks. A new corporate governance framework has also recently been introduced. In light of the potential risks from a sustained further decline in oil prices, and given high loan concentrations, common exposures and interconnectedness of the financial system (Box 3), the CBK’s enhanced surveillance is well positioned for early identification of financial stability risks. In particular, staff welcomed the ongoing initiatives to strengthen stress testing techniques, develop early warning indicators, step up efforts to monitor deposit trends, and identify emerging pressures in corporate and household balance sheets. </P><P MCID="3">25.      A number of steps would help further strengthen financial sector resilience. The authorities agreed that a formal framework for operationalizing macro-prudential measures would help maintain appropriate coverage of risks over time and the balance between preempting the buildup of excessive risks and alleviating possible liquidity shocks and pro-cyclicality in credit and asset markets. Reforms to strengthen the insolvency regime are ongoing in collaboration with the World Bank. Progress on this front, combined with judicial reforms to introduce commercial courts and expedite enforcement, would help minimize losses-given-default. While the CBK is well-equipped to deal with possible liquidity shortages,11 there was recognition that developing a liquidity forecasting framework could also help anticipate potential system-wide pressures. The CBK offers a Shari’ah compliant Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) facility to Islamic banks. The development of a sovereign Sukuk market would nonetheless help increase the availability of high-quality liquid assets for banks. There was also agreement that sustaining efforts to streamline noncore bank activities where corporate structures are complex would facilitate risk identification and effective supervision.  </P><P MCID="4">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">11 Banks are required to comply with five liquidity indicators: the liquidity coverage ratio, a loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD), limits on maturity mismatches, a regulatory liquidity ratio and a net stable funding ratio. </P></page>

Low Oil Prices, Macro-Financial Linkages and Banking System Resilience1  </P><P MCID="1"></P><P MCID="2">Kuwait’s financial sector performance has traditionally been interwoven with the oil price cycle. Given the country’s high dependence on hydrocarbons and a business model for banks that revolves around the domestic economy—as they obtain over 90 percent of their funding, and hold 80 percent of assets, domestically—deposit and asset growth, as well as asset quality, have been highly correlated with oil prices. The key channel of transmission has been government expenditure, which has been a main driver of nonoil activity, and has in the past moved in tandem with oil price fluctuations. Price fluctuations can also impact banks through asset prices—particularly equities and real estate—and regional spillovers.  </P><P MCID="3">In recent years, prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies have reduced the vulnerability of the banking system to oil price shocks. Large accumulated financial buffers have provided the policy space to avoid abrupt spending cuts and increase growth-enhancing capital expenditures. An increase in public sector entities deposits has supported liquidity in the banking system, and the authorities have been careful in ensuring that domestic financing of the government deficit does not crowd out the private sector. As a result, the lower oil prices have had a limited impact on nonoil GDP growth and bank asset quality, and banks have remained profitable and liquid. Strong supervision has also contributed to banks maintaining large capital buffers and provisions.  </P><P MCID="4">Kuwait is, nevertheless, not immune to a protracted period of low oil prices. Reform set-backs, a slow DP implementation or a further sustained drop in oil prices, if they result in lower growth, can set in motion adverse macro-financial dynamics. Previous staff analysis found that nonoil GDP, real estate prices and equity prices drive nonperforming loans.2 Staff’s sensitivity analyses show that the banking system is on aggregate resilient, but under severe stress scenarios, a few banks may require additional capital. Loan concentrations to single borrowers present the biggest risk for banks while sectoral concentrations, particularly to real estate are a risk for selected banks. The banking system also exhibits significant deposit concentrations, although liquidity risk is mitigated by the large public ownership of the deposits and the demonstrated willingness to support banking system liquidity.  </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Continued enhanced surveillance and ongoing efforts to close regulatory gaps are therefore key to safeguarding financial stability. Enhanced surveillance is critical for the timely identification of risks and timely policy response. Ongoing efforts to close regulatory gaps related to the insolvency regime and crisis management will help minimize losses in the event that defaults materialize. </P><P MCID="7">________________________________ </P><P MCID="8">1 See accompanying Selected Issues Paper “Macro-financial linkages and resilience of the financial sector”. </P><P MCID="9">2 See “The resilience of the banking system to macroeconomic shocks in Kuwait” in IMF Country Report No. 15/328”. </P><P MCID="10"></P><P MCID="11">  </P><P MCID="12">Kuwait banks exhibit significant concentrations in loan Deposits exhibit even greater concentration, largely toportfolios to single borrowersgovernment related entitiesSource: CBK, Bloomberg, IEA0102030405060ABCDEFGHIJKPercentBanksDeposit Concentrations(Share in total deposits) 1 largest depositor2 largest depositors0102030405060ABCDEFGHIJKABCDEFGHIJKRatio to regulatory capitalRatio to Gross AdvancesLoan ConcentrationsTop 1Top 2</P></page>

Strengthening the crisis management framework would promote orderly resolution of banks in the event of stress and safeguard fiscal resources. A special resolution regime for banks has not yet been put in place. A blanket guarantee covers all banking system deposits. Staff recommended that consideration be given to establishing frameworks that allow for least-cost and effective resolution in the event of stress in the banking system. Formalizing arrangements between key regulatory institutions would also help improve crisis preparedness. The authorities have started preparatory work on a bank resolution framework, and IMF technical assistance in these areas is planned in the next few months. </P><P MCID="1">27.      Kuwaiti banks have not faced withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships. However, to avoid the perception of risk that could prompt global banks to cut relations with them, several domestic banks have preemptively severed links with some domestic charities and foreign exchange houses. The CBK has been actively participating in international forums aimed at clarifying home supervisor requirements and maintaining open channels of communication between domestic and foreign banks and regulators.  </P><P MCID="2">28.      Efforts to implement and further strengthen the AML/CFT and anticorruption frameworks are ongoing. Consistent with the revised FATF standard, regulators are placing greater emphasis on risk-based AML/CFT inspections. The results of the ongoing ML/TF national risk assessment (NRA), conducted with assistance from the World Bank, will inform the development of a strategic plan for Kuwait. Following revocation of the 2012 decree setting up the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) for procedural reasons, a new law was adopted in January 2016, keeping the mandate, powers and organizational structure of the ACA broadly unchanged.

Under current trends, less than one fourth of new nationals entering the labor market over the next 5 years would find jobs in the private sector, which would imply a continued trade-off between absorbing the remaining in the public sector—and allowing the wage bill to rise—or letting unemployment increase. Breaking this trend requires switching the engines of growth from the public to the private sector, encouraging investment away from capital-intensive extractive industries, and fostering private sector hiring of nationals.  </P><P MCID="6">46810121416182001020304050607080Scenario IScenario IIScenario IIIKuwait: Labor Market absorption of nationals under different scenarios(in percent of total new entrants) 1/Public employmentPrivate employmentWage bill/GDP (RHS)Unemployment rate (RHS)Source:IMF staff estimates1/ The chart illustrates the challenge of employing 123 thousand expected new Kuwaiti entrants to the labor force by 2020.

Addressing labor market inefficiencies is critical to bolster private sector employment of nationals. Labor market and civil service reforms should aim at improving incentives for nationals to take up jobs in the private sector, including by managing expectations about the limited future availability of public sector jobs. Sustaining the recent efforts to streamline public sector wages and benefits would also contribute to making the private sector more attractive and encourage the hiring of nationals by private-sector firms. The authorities agreed that boosting the private sector demand for nationals’ labor would also require further progress toward fostering an education system that reduces skill mismatches.  </P><P MCID="1">31.      Staff welcomed the focus of the government’s six-pillar reform plan on privatization and public and private partnerships. Building on stronger legal and institutional frameworks, the government aims at greater use of these options to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy and upgrade infrastructure. While the privatization program is still in its early stages, several Build-Operate-Transfer projects are in the pipeline. Continued progress toward establishing clear timetables, advancing preparatory work to strengthen underlying assets, and promoting a transparent environment that fosters competition and reduces hidden costs and contingent liabilities for the government will help stimulate private sector investment and boost productivity.  </P><P MCID="2">32.      Further improving the business environment is important to foster diversification. Recent efforts include the opening of the Kuwait Business Center, a one-stop window that will help streamline registration and licensing procedures, and steps toward digitalizing administrative procedures.

Staff emphasized the need to sustain reforms to facilitate access to land and finance, reduce the burden of administrative procedures and excessive regulations, and foster competition.12 It welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the functioning of the National Fund for SMEs development to free up resources for small businesses and suggested consideration be given to reviewing the hurdles to SMEs’ access to finance, including the potential impact of the cap on banks’ lending interest rate spreads. </P><P MCID="3">D.

Against this backdrop, the fiscal and external positions are projected to improve as adjustment proceeds and oil prices recover somewhat, and nonoil growth is projected to regain momentum to about 4 percent over the medium term supported by a continued improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan. The main risk to the outlook stems from a further sustained decline in oil prices. Slow project implementation, more volatile global financial conditions and spillovers from heightened regional security risks could also affect economic prospects.  </P><P MCID="1">35.      Nonetheless, “lower-for-longer” oil prices call for steadfast implementation of reforms. The government’s six-pillar reform strategy is rightly focused on reforming public finances and promoting a greater role for the private sector in generating growth and jobs for nationals. Efforts to streamline current spending, including the recent gasoline and utility price reforms, and measures to facilitate business licensing are steps in the right direction. Maintaining consensus in favor of economic transformation and sustaining the reform momentum is paramount for the success of the strategy.  </P><P MCID="2">36.      Fiscal reforms should focus on addressing underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and be designed so as to minimize any dampening impact on growth. Gradual removal of fuel and electricity subsidies and control of the wage bill through a well-designed reform that avoids significant upfront costs would help reduce budget rigidities, while the introduction of the VAT and business profit tax and the repricing of government services would go a long way in diversifying revenue away from oil. These fiscal reforms should be designed and sequenced with a view to striking a balance between generating fiscal savings in line with intergenerational equity levels and mitigating the drawbacks of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. A comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework based on a top-down approach and articulated around clearly-specified medium-term fiscal objectives would help guide the consolidation plans and reduce implementation risks.   </P><P MCID="3">37.      Fiscal financing options should be assessed within a comprehensive asset/liability management framework with due consideration to macro-financial linkages. Consistent with the government’s current approach, a balanced financing mix that combines continued drawdown of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance and some external borrowing would mitigate potential crowding out of private sector credit while maintaining a high level of liquid buffers. Continued progress toward strengthening the institutional and legal frameworks, including to support a more comprehensive and longer-term view on asset and liability management, improving debt issuance processes, and fostering increased transparency would ensure effective debt management and support the development of domestic fixed income markets. </P><P MCID="4">38.

Partial information from a different sample of firms, available for the first half of 2016, points to a further profit slowdown in 2016, with real estate firms showing a marked decline in net profits in 1H2016 (36 percent decline y-o-y within a sample of 35 real estate firms).3 </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Operating Profit /Loss </P><P MCID="4">(Millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted) </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="10">3 Economic Update, National Bank of Kuwait, August 2016. </P><P MCID="11">Sectors2006200720082009201020112012201320142015Changes 14-15Consumer Goods199           409           311           266           210           229           284           343           305           293           Consumer Services253           250           183           137           (3)             115           89            125           51            223           Energy80            162           158           125           231           17            41            83            18            60            Health Care111           134           146           24            37            45            45            43            36            19            Industrials1,127        1,181        1,053        867           435           391           375           511           561           629           Real Estate589           560           714           404           182           384           492           531           462           446           Technology31            26            39            28            27            9              17            4              13            24            Telecommunications1,891        1,985        1,758        2,054        1,864        3,016        1,878        1,647        1,379        1,118        Total4,282        4,707        4,362        3,904        2,982        4,206        3,221        3,287        2,824        2,813        Sources: Orbis, and IMF staff calculations.</P><P MCID="12">-20.0-10.00.010.020.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.02012201320142015Turnover Growth Rate(In percent)Consumer GoodsConsumer ServicesEnergyIndustrialsTelecommunicationsTotalReal Estate (rhs)</P></page>

Kuwait—Baseline and Adjustment Scenario </P><P MCID="1">I. Assumptions </P><P MCID="2"></P><P MCID="3">Baseline scenario </P><P MCID="4">The baseline scenario assumes expenditure restraint and is based on the 2016 budget and enacted policies or reforms. </P><P MCID="5"> Oil revenues are projected using the WEO oil price assumptions and forecast oil export volumes. Kuwait’s oil production is assumed to increase by 2 percent annually over the medium-term.    </P><P MCID="6"> Non-oil revenues, except investment income from the KIA, are assumed to increase broadly in line with nonoil GDP.  </P><P MCID="7"> Savings from the recent increase in fuel prices (about 0.3 percent of GDP by 2021) and the electricity and water tariff adjustment (1.1 percent of GDP) that have been approved and will come into effect early next fiscal year have been included in the baseline. Estimates were provided by the authorities. </P><P MCID="8"> The baseline assumes some spending restraint: wages are assumed to grow with inflation, while public employment expands at a rate of 2 percent annually; transfers are assumed to grow with inflation; goods and services expand in line with nonoil GDP.  </P><P MCID="9"> Consistent with recent developments, capital expenditure is assumed to grow at a slightly higher rate than nonoil GDP. </P><P MCID="10">Adjustment scenario </P><P MCID="11">Staff’s adjustment scenario assumes a gradual reduction of expenditure as a share of non-oil GDP to 80 percent by 2021. The target is derived from a historical normal level and would result in a gradual reduction of the gap from intergenerational equity level of the non-oil primary balance. The expenditure target is consistent with the government objectives in Kuwait’s vision of “reduction of the budget deficit and movement toward sustainable public finance, and redefining of the government’s role in the national economy:” </P><P MCID="12"> Further to the baseline, fuel prices are assumed to gradually increase starting from fiscal year 2017/18 to reach international or cost recovery levels by 2021 (elimination of fuel subsidy).  </P><P MCID="13"> Water and electricity tariffs are assumed increase gradually to reduce subsidy by half in 2021.  </P><P MCID="14"> Compensation for fuel prices changes is assumed to be paid to households. Recent discussions between parliamentarians and the government indicate that Kuwaiti nationals may be compensated by a capped amount of 75 liters per month.  </P><P MCID="15"> The wage bill is driven by stable public employment and wages increasing by slightly less than inflation. The wage reform under consideration is assumed to take effect starting 2017. Staff has assumed that it will lead in the first year to an increase in the wage bill by KD 350 million due to standardization of the salary structure, and annual wage increases in line with inflation. Staff has  assumed wage increases below inflation under the adjustment scenario, in which inflation will be higher because of subsidy and VAT reforms—consistent with staff advice to allow flexibility to increase wage by less than inflation if macroeconomic conditions warrant.  </P><P MCID="16"> Goods and services, transfers, and other current spending items are projected to increase by a slower rate than in the baseline (non-oil GDP growth) by 1-2 percent to help achieve the expenditure target and reflect the authorities’ objectives in the Vision to rationalize spending. </P><P MCID="17"> The adjustment scenario makes room for additional allocations for capital spending (2-2.5 percent above nominal non-oil GDP growth). </P><P MCID="18"> Non-oil revenue will increase as a result of increasing excise tax on tobacco and sugary drinks starting in second half of 2017 with full effect in 2018 by KD 200 million, introducing the corporate profit tax on domestic corporates starting 2020 (estimated additional of 1.6 percent of GDP based on IMF TA estimates), and the VAT at 5 percent (estimated to generate 1.5 percent of additional revenue) starting 2019. </P><P MCID="19"></P></page>

External Sector Assessment for Kuwait  </P><P MCID="1">Staff considers the peg to a basket of currencies appropriate for Kuwait. While the external position in 2015 was weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable medium-term policies, the recommended substantial fiscal adjustment over the medium-term would bring the current account broadly in line with the level implied by fundamentals.  </P><P MCID="2">Kuwait’s current account surplus has declined significantly in 2015, reflecting mainly the oil price shock. Kuwait’s large current account surplus (over 33 percent of GDP in 2014) declined to about 5¼ percent in 2015 due to lower oil prices and, to a lesser extent, declining oil export volumes. While it is set to deteriorate further this year (to a projected 4½ percent of GDP), as the further decline in oil prices more than offsets a recovery in export volumes, staff projects a gradual improvement in the current account balance over the medium term (to a surplus of above 10 percent of GDP by 2021), as oil prices pick up and hydrocarbon export volumes expand.  </P><P MCID="3">Financial outflows also eased substantially last year. The reduction in oil export receipts and related government revenue has slowed the pace of foreign assets accumulation on the part of the government. At the same time, non-government sector foreign assets continued to accumulate. Overall, portfolio outflows declined from US$62 billion to US$33 billion. On the other hand, other investments turned positive US$28 billion, as the government drew down foreign deposits to finance the budget deficit. Overall, financial outflows were somewhat larger than the current account surplus, leading to a decline in CBK foreign exchange reserves (by US$4 billion to US$28.3 billion).   </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8">-60.00-40.00-20.000.0020.0040.0060.00200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016Financial account including net errors and omissionsCurrent accountChange in ReservesCurrent and Financial Account Balances(Percent of GDP)</P></page>

Foreign reserves of the CBK stood at $28.3 billion (25 percent of GDP, 6.5 months of imports, 25 percent of broad money and 99 percent of the Fund’s reserve metric) at end-2015, 1 percentage points below the minimum adequacy level.1 Traditionally, exports of goods and services and broad money contributed the most to the ARA metric, but in 2015 the share of exports dropped due to substantial decline in oil exports receipts. Consequently, the three components of the ARA metric (exports, short term external debt, and other liabilities) had similar contributions. The reserve level is on track to increase to about $31.5 billion in 2016 and reach 106 percent of the ARA metric.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">In addition, the Kuwait Investment Authority also holds a large stock of financial buffers (which staff estimates at about 460 percent of GDP, with about 317 percent in FGF and 144 percent in GRF) on behalf of the government. The bulk of these financial resources, which are mainly invested in foreign assets, are held as savings for future generations, but some can also be used for precautionary motives. </P><P MCID="3">Staff considers the peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies appropriate. This arrangement, which has been in place since May 2007, has provided an effective nominal anchor. The modest depreciation against the dollar since mid-2014 (7 percent) on account of having a basket rather than dollar peg has been helpful during a period of dollar strength. The NEER has remained largely unchanged since oil prices started falling in mid-2014. The REER has appreciated, but to a lesser extent than in other GCC countries. </P><P MCID="4">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">1 The Fund’s composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves (developed for emerging markets) calculates the relative risk weights for each source of foreign exchange drain based on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from Emerging Markets (EMs) during exchange market pressure episodes.

The implied current account norm based on a constant real per-capita annuity is 13 percent of GDP in 2016, compared to the baseline current account surplus of 4 percent of GDP, resulting in an estimated current account gap of about 9 percent of GDP that is projected to remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon. Since external imbalances in Kuwait are largely driven by the public sector, the current account gap could be closed through fiscal consolidation. Indeed, closing the large PIH fiscal gap (estimated to reach about 12 percent of GDP by 2021) would largely eliminate the current account gap. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">2 The approach calculates the current account required for the net present value (NPV) of hydrocarbon and investment income to equal the NPV of imports net of non-hydrocarbon exports. To support intergenerational equity, the economy would need to choose a path for imports —and hence a current account norm—by accumulating net foreign assets at an appropriate pace.

The Kuwait program emphasizes implementation of reforms. Hence all activities are grounded in the Government’s five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line ministry/agency as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role and the Bank’s central counterpart. The current Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) program is structured around the following four strategic themes under the latest 2016-20 Country Partnership Strategy:  </P><P MCID="6">(i) Public sector performance and citizen accountability– Bank support in this area aims at ensuring that public services are delivered transparently, efficiently and effectively and that citizen accountability is enhanced. Key activities under this pillar include Bank support in a mix of areas including technical assistance on a multi-year tax modernization project; strengthening public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) and developing a guidebook for public private partnerships. Other pipeline engagements focus on providing capacity-building assistance to the Kuwait National Assembly and the State Audit Bureau, as well as Public Financial Management (PFM). The latter is designed as a programmatic multi-year engagement to improve the quality of fiscal policies and the system of procedures governing public financial management in the country. </P><P MCID="7">(ii) Private sector development - Aiming to support reform efforts geared towards transforming Kuwait into a commercial and financial hub with diversified economic activities and the creation of a more conducive business environment for private sector development and foreign direct investment. Bank activities under this theme include: supporting the design and implementation of an insolvency and creditors rights framework, support in establishing the new Competition Protection Authority and the National Fund for SME Development. The last is a flagship engagement. </P><P MCID="8">(iii) Human development - major program to support the quality of education. Bank support in this area also includes social protection, labor and potentially health policy reforms.   </P><P MCID="9">(iv)  Infrastructure Development and Urban Management - aiming to make significant improvements in its infrastructure and urban management sectors including land management and the environment. Current engagements include a multi-year land management modernization project with the Ministry of Finance and the State Property Sector and a solid waste management project with the Kuwait Municipality. Pipeline activities include support to the new Transport Authority, Tourism Development, and e-government services at the Kuwait Municipality.   </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Despite further improvements in the current year, there is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness, particularly for the national and fiscal accounts, is an area of concern. </P><P MCID="11"></P><P MCID="12">National Accounts and Production:   </P><P MCID="13">Kuwait’s national accounts are compiled by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) and require development to maintain consistency with international best practice. Annual GDP estimates are derived from a benchmark year of 2010 and considered broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities are encouraged to select and implement a contemporary benchmark to rebase the GDP time series to ensure structural changes in Kuwait’s economy are reflected in published estimates. The sources and methods used to estimate individual components of GDP should be publicly disclosed to identify areas where further improvement is required. Known examples are the inadequate methodology used to construct volume movements for subsidies on products; and outdated methodology used to aggregate financial services indirectly measured (FISIM) into GDP, areas for which ongoing discussions are taking place between the CSB and IMF staff. These are likely to impact the oil and non-oil industry shares of value added until revised estimates are published towards the end of 2017. A quarterly GDP time series for 2010–17 will be disseminated during 2018. A technical assistance mission conducted in March 2015 provided other recommendations to: enhance source data by improving coordination between government agencies; compile comprehensive estimates of informal activity; and implement methods to consistent with international standards. </P><P MCID="14">Price statistics </P><P MCID="15">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published on a monthly basis (last observation for October 2016). The weights are based on the 2007 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and are therefore unlikely to be representative of current expenditure patterns. Changes to the CPI weights are underway and are expected to be completed by February 2017. The new weights will be updated using the results of the 2013 HIES. The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers selected Mining and Quarrying and Manufacturing industries as well as Utilities. The PPI should be further developed by updating the weights from the 2010 base year, by extending coverage to include services and construction and by compiling separate indexes for the domestic and export markets. Improvements in these dimensions are under consideration in coordination with other GCC countries. </P><P MCID="16"></P><P MCID="17"></P></page>

The major components of extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign debt and treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on interest on foreign debt and treasury paper are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions, but the regular provision of data on investment income is lacking. </P><P MCID="1">The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal developments during the year. Progress is being made toward improving compliance with the GFSM 2001 guidance, particularly in terms of creating a new chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual basis. </P><P MCID="2">Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing of information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform activities for public policy purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An additional extension of coverage would be to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated central government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices recommended in the Code. </P><P MCID="3"></P><P MCID="4">Monetary and financial statistics: The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular basis based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). However, the data submission could be improved as it is not always reported on a timely basis. CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits) are classified as other financial corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not significant. The Capital Markets Authority needs to collate and disseminate information related to investment companies. </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6">Financial Surveillance: Kuwait is not reporting financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to STA for public dissemination. The authorities are encouraged to report FSIs for the deposit-taking sectors and other financial corporations. </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8">Balance of Payments Statistics:  From 2009 data, the CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual balance of payments and international investment position data, and from 2015 – quarterly balance of payments data in accordance with the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are disseminated quarterly by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB). However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment enterprises. The CSB, working with the CBK, implemented the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in 2010-12. This initiative should improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements are needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and private transfers. </P><P MCID="9">The information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it excludes the external assets held by the general government (with the exception of loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and general government trade credits).  This data is expected to be reported to the Fund by the Executive Director for Kuwait at the time of the upcoming Article IV board meeting. </P><P MCID="10"></P></page>

It has also made progress in the estimation of remittances data. Yet, delays and data gaps remain. In particular, coordination among major government entities is needed to provide quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely quarterly statistics.
