Growth was estimated to come to a halt in 2016, with the non-oil sector contracting by ½ percent dragged down by the industrial, construction, and services sectors; industrial production, despite the potential for import substitution, was constrained by shortages of imported inputs due to limited availability of foreign exchange. Annual inflation was estimated to reach 45 percent by end 2016—the highest rate in over a decade—reflecting higher domestic fuel prices, a weaker kwanza, and the lagged effects of loose monetary conditions until the first half of the year. Non-oil primary balance in 2015-16 showed an improvement of 18 percent of GDP mainly through spending rationalization. The current account deficit, which peaked at 10 percent of GDP in 2015, is projected to be halved in 2016-17, as imports continue adjusting to limited availability of foreign exchange. International reserves are declining but remain relatively comfortable. Meanwhile, a wide spread between the parallel and primary market exchange rates remains, pointing to a significant imbalance in the foreign exchange market. </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">Executive Board Assessment2 </P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15">Executive Directors noted that the oil price shock that started in 2014 has substantially reduced fiscal revenue and exports, while growth has stopped and inflation has accelerated. Directors commended the authorities for taking steps to mitigate the impact of the shock, but urged further measures to stabilize macroeconomic conditions and address more forcefully the dependence on oil and diversify the economy.  </P><P MCID="16"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="17">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Directors urged concerted efforts to contain the growth of the wage bill, improve the quality of public investment, continue streamlining subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor, and strengthen nonoil revenue, including by implementing a VAT in due course. They also emphasized the need to clear domestic payments arrears and welcomed plans to restructure state-owned enterprises. Directors noted that adopting a medium-term fiscal framework would help reduce the pro-cyclicality of public spending and improve investment planning.  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Directors underscored that monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in rebalancing the foreign exchange market. They welcomed the recent measures taken by the central bank to tighten liquidity conditions, but saw a need to enhance the monetary policy framework to better anchor inflation expectations and facilitate a transition to greater exchange rate flexibility. Directors underscored that a more flexible exchange rate coupled with supportive monetary and fiscal policies will be crucial in addressing foreign exchange market imbalances while containing inflation. Directors urged the phased elimination of the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Directors emphasized the need to preserve the health of the banking sector. They supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the bank supervision and resolution frameworks. Directors recommended conducting rigorous asset quality reviews, and welcomed the authorities’ actions to ensure that weaker banks are recapitalized. They noted that the plan to restructure and recapitalize the systemically-important state-owned BPC bank is an important step. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Directors stressed the need to address the effects of the loss of U.S. dollar correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). They welcomed the high-level dialogue the authorities have been pursuing with the home authorities of global correspondent banks to better understand regulatory expectations around CBRs. At the same time, Directors noted that the central bank should step up its data collection and analysis; develop contingency plans to mitigate the risks from, and address the drivers of, the loss of CBRs; and further strengthen the prudential and AML/CFT frameworks. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Directors welcomed the authorities’ reform agenda to tackle the constraints to economic diversification including through infrastructure and human capital development. They emphasized that these measures should be complemented by enhancing the business environment and strengthening governance, including efforts to address corruption-related risks, to foster private investment and inclusive growth. </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Directors encouraged the authorities to address remaining gaps in the production of economic data. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12"> </P></page>

This has brought to the forefront the need to address more forcefully vulnerabilities and dependence on oil, and to diversify the economy. The authorities have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the external shock: an 18 percent of GDP improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16, mainly through spending cuts including the removal of fuel subsidies, has been implemented; and the kwanza has been devalued against the U.S. dollar by over 40 percent since September 2014, with international reserves being used to smooth the depreciation. However, the exchange rate has been re-pegged since April 2016 leading to an appreciation of the kwanza in real terms, and further policy actions are needed to continue adjusting the economy to the ‘new normal’ in the oil market and to return growth to a level consistent with poverty reduction. </P><P MCID="4">Focus of consultation: Discussions focused on policies to tackle macroeconomic imbalances while promoting financial stability, economic diversification, and growth. </P><P MCID="5">Key policy recommendations:  </P><P MCID="6"> Target an overall fiscal deficit for 2017 of less than 2¼ percent of GDP, consistent with an improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance by 1 percent of GDP. </P><P MCID="7"> Over the medium term, target an improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance by 1 percent of GDP annually consistent with placing debt on a clearly declining path. This could be achieved by mobilizing additional non-oil taxes, and reducing current spending and increasing public investment while improving its efficiency. </P><P MCID="8"> Adopt an improved medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), focusing on spending rules and a well-designed fiscal stabilization fund to reduce spending pro-cyclicality. </P><P MCID="9"> Move to a flexible but managed exchange rate regime to urgently address significant imbalances in the foreign exchange market, and develop a clear timetable for removal of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. </P><P MCID="10"> Adopt a reserve money target consistent with the inflation objective. </P><P MCID="11"> Increase financial sector resilience by strengthening bank supervision, resolution and AML/CFT frameworks, and closing or recapitalizing weaker banks. </P><P MCID="12"> Promote economic diversification by improving the business environment, and by strengthening the role of the private sector in rebuilding infrastructure.  </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14"> </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16">December 23, 2016 </P></page>

Angola is a post-conflict country—decades of hostilities ended in 2002—with significant infrastructure and human capital deficits. Oil receipts underpinned strong growth in the last decade, but have also made the country vulnerable to oil revenue volatility. Progress was made in reducing poverty rates from 54 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2008. However, inequality has increased. Following elections in 2012, the government has embarked on a National Development Plan (NDP) that puts priority on a large expansion of infrastructure spending to support economic diversification and inclusive growth. However, spending is well below that stipulated in the NDP. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for August 2017, and the top name of the winning party’s list of candidates will become the next President of the Republic. </P><P MCID="3">RECENT ECONOMIC DEVE</P><P MCID="4">L</P><P MCID="5">OPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND</P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">RISKS</P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">2. The economy has been severely affected by lower international oil prices: </P><P MCID="10"> Growth slowed to 3 percent in 2015, driven by a very sharp slowdown in non-oil activity to 1½ percent as the industrial, construction, and services sectors adjusted to cuts in private consumption and public investment amid more limited availability of foreign exchange, and agriculture underperformed its potential due to supply shocks. High frequency economic activity indicators point to a deeper slowdown in 2016, with the business confidence reaching all-time lows in the second and third quarters of 2016. </P><P MCID="11"> Inflation reached 41 percent in November 2016, year-on-year, reflecting a weaker kwanza, higher domestic fuel prices, and loose monetary conditions until the first half of the year. </P><P MCID="12"> Fiscal policy was tightened. The overall fiscal deficit narrowed to 3¼ percent of GDP in 2015, with the non-oil primary fiscal balance improving by 12¼ percent of GDP given large reductions in spending on subsidies,1 goods and services, and investment. Budget under-execution in the first nine months of 2016 led to an additional improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance, but an estimated 3 percent of GDP in domestic payments arrears have accumulated. </P><P MCID="13"> The BNA tightened monetary policy recently. Base money contracted by 3 percent in October 2016, year-on-year, from an expansion of 25 percent in May 2016, and banking </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="14">1 The Government has been implementing a well-designed fuel subsidy reform. On December 31, 2015, domestic fuel prices were increased for the fourth time since September 2014. With this latest increase, subsidies on diesel were fully eliminated and the price of diesel liberalized, adding this product to already liberalized gasoline, asphalt, and light and heavy fuel oil prices. LPG and kerosene domestic prices were also increased on the occasion, but remain subsidized at about 40 percent and 10 percent, respectively. </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16"></P></page>

Short-term interest rates, however, remain negative in real terms.  </P><P MCID="1"> The health of the banking system deteriorated driven by slower growth. The banking system’s capital adequacy ratio declined to 18¾ percent in September 2016 compared to 19¾ percent in December 2015, while NPLs increased to 15¼ percent from 11½ percent during the same period, reflecting lower ability of corporates to meet obligations as growth slowed. Commercial banks have managed to contain a more significant deterioration of financial stability indicators (FSIs) through increased provisioning and stricter underwriting to mitigate credit risk, and some corporate loan restructuring. In September 2016, five banks, including the systemically-important state-owned BPC, were undercapitalized and needed to meet prudential requirements. </P><P MCID="2"> The external current account deficit widened, but net international reserves (NIR) remained relatively comfortable at US$24¼ billion at end-2015. The external current account deficit reached 10 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to 3 percent of GDP in 2014, as lower exports were only partially offset by lower imports. The trade balance improved in the first ten months of 2016, as lower exports were offset by a sharper import contraction. NIR declined to US$20⅓ billion in November 2016, as the BNA increased its sales of foreign exchange (forex) amid shortages in the market, financed in part by US$2 billion (with 2-5 year terms) in Repo transactions, using some of its reserve assets (U.S. Treasury bonds) as collateral.2 </P><P MCID="3"> Significant imbalances in the forex market remain. Despite a devaluation of the official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar of more than 40 percent between September 2014 and April 2016,3 and BNA’s increased provision of forex to the market in recent months, the parallel-official exchange rate spread has remained high and volatile (190 percent in November 2016),4 and the backlog of forex purchase orders in the banking system is estimated conservatively at about US$3 billion.  </P><P MCID="4">3. The outlook for 2016 is adverse. Growth is projected to have come to a halt, with the non-oil sector contracting by ½ percent dragged down by the industrial, construction, and services sectors; industrial production, despite the potential for import substitution, is constrained by shortages of imported inputs due to limited forex availability. Annual inflation is expected to reach 45 percent by end-2016—the highest rate in over a decade—reflecting higher domestic fuel prices, a weaker kwanza, and the lagged effects of loose monetary conditions until the first half of 2016, despite an improvement of 5¾ percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance in 2016. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">2 These transactions have no effect on the NIR level as the BNA’s loss of liquid assets—since securities used as collateral are not liquid during the contract period—is offset by its cash borrowing. Consistent with STA recommended methodology, however, gross reserves increase as a result of such transactions. </P><P MCID="6">3 The kwanza has been re-pegged to the U.S. dollar since April 2016. </P><P MCID="7">4 The parallel market rate should not be interpreted as the equilibrium rate as this is a very thin market with a narrow subset of transactions in banknotes. </P></page>

Linkages from the real sector to the financial sector are limited. As noted above, commercial banks have been affected by the economic slowdown, leading to higher NPLs. The private credit linkages from the financial sector to the real sector have become less significant recently due in part to increased credit risk with banks in particular reducing consumer and mortgage lending as well as reducing loans to mining and construction. Historically, the level of credit to the private sector has been relatively low, with banks channeling to the private sector less than a half of their domestic assets. As economic growth slows, banks are further tightening lending standards and this may delay, at the margin, a recovery.  </P><P MCID="1">5. Under the baseline scenario, the outlook for 2017 is slightly better, but subject to downside risks. Growth would pick up to 1¼ percent in 2017, with the non-oil sector expanding by the same magnitude due to higher public spending and better terms-of-trade. Inflation would decline to 20 percent by end-2017, assuming tight monetary conditions, no further domestic fuel price increases, and a stable kwanza. NIR is projected to decline further to US$17½ billion. </P><P MCID="2">6. Under the staff’s proposed adjustment scenario discussed below, growth is projected to accelerate at a faster pace and inflation to decline to single digits over the medium term. While slower in the near term, non-oil growth would increase over time reflecting, in addition to improved terms-of-trade and the completion of several important projects, a more competitive real effective exchange rate (REER)5 and a faster pace of implementation of structural reforms, including a more forceful improvement in the business environment leading to increased private investment. Inflation is projected to decline as monetary policy is tightened upfront more aggressively, returning to the BNA’s annual inflation objective of 7-9 percent at the end of the projection period. Delaying the needed policy adjustment measures until 2018—after a new government is formed following the elections—is likely to increase the cost of adjustment and delay its future benefits. </P><P MCID="3">7. This medium-term outlook under the baseline scenario is not without risks and is not the desirable outcome. Growth is projected to remain barely positive and below population growth, inflation is expected to decline only gradually, fiscal space would be limited, and imbalances in the forex market would remain. Angola faces the challenge of balancing the pressures from lower oil revenue compared to 2010-13 levels and high demand for much needed improvements in the country’s physical infrastructure and human capital and poverty alleviation. This will require a better balance between current and capital spending rationalization, making fiscal consolidation more sustainable over the medium term. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Angola’s public debt remains sustainable but is highly sensitive to shocks, including to the international price of oil, real GDP growth, financial contingent liability, and the exchange rate. </P><P MCID="4">8. Risks are tilted to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix). They include lower oil prices, difficulties to control spending in the run-up to next year’s elections, continued imbalances in the forex market, a sustained period of low growth with limited opportunities to address social needs, </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="5">5 This scenario assumes a depreciation of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar of 30 percent in 2016 and 45 percent in 2017. </P></page>

Spillovers: Outward spillovers to the region are generally limited given Angola’s marginal trade and financial flows with countries in the region, although a few countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia, which border Angola, are being more affected by the economic difficulties in Angola through cross-border trade. Although Angola is Portugal’s largest export market outside the EU and several Portuguese banks are present in the Angolan banking system through joint-ventures with local investors, the magnitude of these interests remain relatively small if compared with the size of the Portuguese economy. On the other hand, inward spillovers from China and Europe could be tangible if their economic growth significantly slows down, putting further downward pressure on oil prices. </P><P MCID="2">Authorities’ views  </P><P MCID="3">10. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s overall assessment of the outlook and risks. But they expect growth to be stronger and headline inflation lower than staff’s baseline scenario. </P><P MCID="4">POLICY DISCUSSIONS</P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">11. The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has brought to the forefront the need to address dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and reduce vulnerabilities. As a result of the decline in oil prices, fiscal revenue and exports fell substantially, output growth came to a halt, and inflation accelerated sharply. The policy steps taken to mitigate the impact of the external shock have been significant, including an improvement of 18 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16; and devaluation of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar by over 40 percent since September 2014. However, further policy actions are needed to continue adjusting the economy to the 'new normal' in the international oil market, including additional but gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term; greater exchange rate flexibility and tight monetary conditions to address lingering imbalances in the forex market while restoring price stability; and supporting greater diversification of the economy to strengthen resilience to future oil price shocks. Vulnerabilities in the banking system also need to be addressed.  </P><P MCID="7">A.   Fiscal Policy under the ‘New Normal’ </P><P MCID="8">12. An overall fiscal deficit of the magnitude envisaged in the draft budget for 2017 would leave the economy vulnerable to lower-than-projected oil prices and heightened concerns about public debt sustainability.6 For 2017, targeting an overall fiscal deficit of no more than 2¼ percent of GDP that is consistent with an improvement of at least 1 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance—in line with the gradual adjustment that would be needed over the </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="9">6 External financing of the 2017 budget is envisaged to come from bilateral credit lines/loans.

The following measures could be considered to achieve this objective: (i) granting no wage increase (⅔ percent of GDP vis-à-vis the baseline scenario); (ii) using for deficit reduction the wage bill savings from the ongoing biometric census of civil servants (up to ½ percent of GDP); (iii) further rationalizing spending on goods and services (up to 1 percent of GDP); and (iv) maintaining the execution of public investment in line with recent (lower) execution rates (¾ percent of GDP).  </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">13. Over the medium term, permanently lower oil revenue needs to be offset by expenditure rationalization and higher non-oil revenue; and fiscal institutions need to be strengthened to properly manage oil revenue volatility. Important steps have been already taken in this direction, including the comprehensive program to gradually eliminate fuel subsidies and reforms to strengthen non-oil revenue, including by enlarging the tax base; creating a single revenue administration agency; strengthening tax inspections; and better enforcing real estate taxation. The following additional policies and structural fiscal reforms would be needed to cement medium-term fiscal sustainability: </P><P MCID="3"> Targeting a non-oil primary fiscal consolidation path of 1 percent of GDP annually over the medium term which, under current assumptions regarding international oil prices, would be consistent with eliminating the overall fiscal deficit by 2018 and placing debt on a clearly declining path. </P><P MCID="4"> Strengthening the credibility of the Law on Public Debt by introducing an escape clause to the 60 percent of GDP debt ceiling when the economy is subject to a large exogenous shock, while introducing a transparent mechanism to ensure convergence over time to the 60 percent of GDP debt ceiling. </P><P MCID="5"> Strengthening the ongoing efforts to enlarge the tax base, improve tax inspections, and better enforce real estate taxation; and introducing a VAT on January 1, 2019 (Box 1).

The authorities did not dispute the need for fiscal consolidation over the medium term, but stressed the urgent need in the near term to support growth after two years of fiscal retrenchment. Consequently, a mildly expansionary budget for 2017 has been approved by the National Assembly. They noted that public debt remains manageable and the needed increase in infrastructure investment can be financed. At the same time, they are committed to scaling back public spending from budgeted levels, if external funding is not forthcoming as projected. The authorities remain interested in working closely with the Fund on fiscal structural reform, including a VAT, although they believe a VAT may take up to four years to be introduced in Angola. The authorities mentioned that they are in the process of closing 48 SOEs that are nonoperational and privatizing 53 others. In addition, a restructuring plan for Sonangol was launched in June 2016 to be implemented over 24 months. The newly appointed Board plans to refocus Sonangol on its core oil and gas businesses while making the company more transparent and efficient. </P><P MCID="43">B.

Greater exchange rate flexibility supported by tight monetary conditions remains critical to orderly address forex market imbalances and provide a nominal anchor to the economy. The large imbalances in the forex market, if unaddressed, could lead to a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate, a sharp acceleration in inflation, and bank losses given the still somewhat high level of dollarization in the economy.

Strengthening Financial Stability </P><P MCID="2">18. Angola has also been adversely affected by the loss of U.S. dollar Correspondent Banking Relationships (CBRs). Since December 2015, global banks discontinued the supply of U.S. dollar banknotes and withdrew U.S. dollar CBRs with Angolan banks. The last remaining U.S. correspondent bank which supplied access to two Angolan respondent banks are no longer able to service their Angolan customers’ U.S. dollar cross-border payment needs. However, Angolan respondent banks are still able to conduct their own portfolio, treasury, trade finance and some credit card operations with their U.S. correspondent bank. Angolan subsidiaries of remaining global U.S. banks are also able to service their Angolan corporate customer needs. These customers are mainly Angolan operators of global oil, gas, and construction entities. Alternative payment channels through greater use of nested U.S. dollar and euro CBRs has mitigated the adverse impacts so far, but risk of losing these payment channels is high. </P><P MCID="3">19. There is an urgent need to fine-tune policy solutions to address the effects of a sizable loss of U.S. dollar CBRs (Box 2). The impact on direct access to cross-border finance and payments for both exports and imports in U.S. dollars could be significant, especially if nested CBRs were also lost. Several measures could help address this issue: </P><P MCID="4"> Mitigating the drivers and risks arising from the loss of CBRs by the BNA stepping up its data collection and analysis efforts (SWIFT data and BNA Questionnaire), enhancing dialogue with the private sector and home authorities of global correspondent banks, strengthening the prudential and AML/CFT framework particularly with regard to corruption-related risks, and developing contingency plans in coordination with all stakeholders. </P><P MCID="5"> Continue to fine-tune policy solutions which may include as a last resort the BNA providing temporary access to low-risk U.S. dollar transfers but also take into account the legal constraints and risks to BNA's other key functions.

The banking system needs to be strengthened. While the banking system's solvency indicators have been deteriorating only gradually they may not be fully reflecting the underlying deterioration in part due to loan restructuring that is being extended also to some non-viable companies (ever-greening).

The authorities have made steady progress on implementing the 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations especially on governance, supervision, and resolution mechanism. Supervisory functions have been restructured with dedicated departments for banking supervision, regulation, foreign exchange supervision, and consumer protection. Regulations have been issued on consolidated supervision and on banks’ internal controls and corporate governance requirements. A financial stability committee under the BNA has been established with the publication of a Financial Stability Report.8 A risk oversight unit is being established with further enhancements being made for on-site supervision and developments of a new supervision and licensing manuals in line with a risk-based supervisory approach. The BNA has also progressed work on aligning banks’ accounting and reporting practices with latest International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Additional work will need to continue to build supervisory effectiveness with regard to implementation on consolidated supervision, systemic stability analysis, and operationalization of prompt corrective action procedures and regulations on emergency liquidity assistance and crisis preparedness. </P><P MCID="3">22. The authorities are making progress in strengthening the Anti Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. Angola was removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) list of countries with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in February 2016, as a result of the progress made in addressing technical items of the action plan agreed with the FATF.9 The authorities are continuing to work with the regional FATF body (ESSAMLG) to address the full range of issues identified in its mutual evaluation report. They should continue efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework in line with the FATF 2012 standard, including with regard to preventive measures on politically exposed persons and risk-based supervision of financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions, ahead of the next AML/CFT evaluation, tentatively scheduled in 2020.  </P><P MCID="4">23.

Additionally, the lack of a mechanism to ensure that the effective exchange rates for transactions that take place at the reference rate in place and the rate at which transactions take place in the foreign exchange auction on that day do not deviate by more than 2 percent gives rise to a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3. Staff encouraged the authorities to remove these, as well as the existing, exchange measures as soon as possible.  </P><P MCID="1">24. A first-time safeguards assessment of the BNA was completed in 2010. The assessment found that the BNA is subject to annual external audits by a reputable firm and has taken steps to address the audit qualifications. Recommendations focused on strengthening governance and transparency practices, internal audit, and the control framework in the reserves management area. Since then some progress has been made in addressing safeguards recommendations. In particular, the BNA has strengthened its internal audit function, and reconstituted its Audit Board. The BNA published its annual financial statements of 2011 through 2014, but the 2015 audited financial statements have yet to be published. </P><P MCID="2">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="3">25. The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis and recommendations. They are taking steps to strengthen the banking sector. For example, they have named a new board of directors of BPC bank and set aside up to 1½ percent of GDP to recapitalize it and clean its bad loan portfolio. They also agreed with the need to enhance Angola’s AML/CFT framework to help address the concerns that have contributed to the loss of all direct U.S. dollar CBRs. The authorities have requested additional Fund technical assistance in this area. </P><P MCID="4">D.   Promoting Economic Diversification </P><P MCID="5">26. The main economic challenge for Angola remains the need to diversify its economy and export base.

The authorities have launched a program targeting sectors considered as having high import-substitution and/or export-promotion potential. These programs are expected to be financed through external credit lines contracted by the government that would then be channeled (on-lent) to the private sector through the state-owned BDA bank. In its initial phase, this program is facilitating the access of private companies, with the above-mentioned potential, to forex needed to import intermediate and capital goods. It will be important to define well how project selection is being conducted and take proper upfront account of risks of non-repayment of the resources that will be on-lent. This program raises concerns given the potential fiscal cost that it could entail; it should be temporary; and its progress and implementation should be more transparent, with its cost disclosed in the annual budget. </P><P MCID="2">28. In addition, the authorities are implementing reforms to enhance the social protection system. With the assistance of the EU and UNICEF, the authorities launched in 2015 the APROSOC Social Protection Program, which aims to improve social assistance for the most vulnerable population. It intends to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of the national social assistance interventions in Angola and to strengthen the capacity of the leading sector Ministry (MINARS) to design and implement a social assistance agenda based on a new sectoral policy framework. The government also aims to create a Single Social Registry to help identify and target the poor. </P><P MCID="3">Authorities’ views </P><P MCID="4">29. The authorities are confident that the measures being implemented to upgrade the country’s infrastructure, improve its human capital, and strengthen the business climate will allow the economy to diversify, making growth more inclusive. They have been investing heavily on infrastructure. They expect two large dams to start producing energy in 2017 and have started construction of the deep-water port of Cabinda. With the assistance of the World Bank, they also plan to expand access to water supply and promote agriculture. They expected that the reforms recently undertaken to facilitate opening a business—such as reducing its cost and timing—should have been reflected in Angola’s rating in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey. The World Bank continues to work closely with the authorities to help improve their doing business indicators. The authorities also emphasized the need to accelerate and deepen reforms to promote diversification. In this context, they have approved 23 targeted programs in the agriculture, industry, fishing, geology, and telecommunications sectors but argued that their implementation has been slow and so far only access to forex has been provided to companies. </P><P MCID="5">E.

The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has substantially reduced fiscal revenue and exports, with growth coming to a halt and inflation accelerating sharply. This has brought to the forefront the need to address more forcefully vulnerabilities and dependence on oil and to diversify the economy. </P><P MCID="4">32. Risks to the near term outlook are on the downside. They include lower oil prices beyond those included in the baseline, difficulties to control spending in the run-up to next year’s elections, continued imbalances in the forex market, a sustained period of low growth with limited opportunities to address social needs, global banks’ withdrawal of CBRs, delays in the recapitalization of weaker banks, and slippages in the implementation of structural reforms. </P><P MCID="5">33. The authorities have taken policy steps to mitigate the impact of the external shock. An 18 percent of GDP improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16, mainly through spending cuts including the removal of fuel subsidies were implemented. Public debt, however, is projected to increase significantly to around 71½ percent of GDP, of which 19 percent of GDP corresponds to Sonangol, by end-2016, and domestic payments arrears have re-emerged. Clearing arrears and, over time, reversing this sharp debt increase will be critical. For 2017, targeting an overall fiscal deficit of no more than 2¼ percent of GDP that is consistent with an improvement of at least 1 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance—in line with the gradual adjustment that would be needed over the medium term to put public debt on a clear downward path—should be achieved through additional spending rationalization. </P><P MCID="6">34. In the context of more limited oil revenue, expenditure rationalization and improved non-oil revenue will be essential. Fiscal deficits should be gradually reduced and over time a non-oil primary fiscal consolidation path of 1 percent of GDP per year should be targeted to restore policy buffers and ensure that part of Angola’s oil wealth is saved for future generations. This can be achieved if concerted efforts are deployed in containing the growth of the wage bill, strengthening non-oil revenue collections, including implementing a VAT, improving the quality of public investment, eliminating electricity and water subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor. </P><P MCID="7">35. Monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in rebalancing the forex market. In recent months, the BNA has appropriately tightened liquidity conditions by increasing its policy rate, banks’ mandatory reserve requirements, and contracting annual base money by 3 percent. The BNA has effectively fixed the official exchange rate since April 2016 but its forex provision has not been sufficient to address needs. As a result, imbalances exist in the forex </P><P MCID="8"></P></page>

If unaddressed, this will likely undermine the official exchange rate as the basis for price formation and inflation expectations, and lead to misallocation of resources in the economy. Addressing this imbalance calls for greater exchange rate flexibility, moderate use of international reserves to smooth out the depreciation of the kwanza, and tighter monetary policy supported by fiscal adjustment to contain the effects of the weaker currency on inflation. </P><P MCID="1">36. The effects of the loss of U.S. dollar CBRs need to be addressed. The authorities have been rightly and actively pursuing high-level dialogue with home authorities of global correspondent banks to better understand regulatory expectations around CBRs. Mitigating the drivers and risks arising from the loss of CBRs by the BNA stepping up its data collection and analysis efforts, enhancing dialogue with the private sector and home regulators of foreign correspondent banks, strengthening the prudential and AML/CFT framework, and developing contingency plans in coordination with all stakeholders will be key to address this risk. </P><P MCID="2">37. Preserving the health of the banking sector is essential to allow the economy to recover over time from the current slowdown. The BNA appropriately focused its efforts to strengthen bank supervision. However, efforts should not be spared in further strengthening bank supervision, resolution frameworks, and closing or recapitalizing weaker banks. In this connection, the conclusion of ongoing asset quality reviews of the major banks and the recapitalization of the systematically-important, state-owned bank, BPC, needs to be accelerated. </P><P MCID="3">38. Economic diversification is crucial to help Angola adjust to the ‘new normal’ in the international oil market. After enjoying the benefits of high international oil prices for almost four consecutive years, it will take time for the economy to adjust to lower prices. The authorities’ reform agenda tackles a number of critical constraints to economic diversification by improving infrastructure, in particular, in transport, energy, and water. Implementation of these initiatives will be critical to improve competitiveness while making growth more inclusive. However, these efforts should be complemented by investing also on human capital and more forcefully addressing Angola's severe impediments to doing businesses. For example, simplifying the procedures for and expediting the issuance of work visas is a priority for private sector development and attracting FDI. </P><P MCID="4">39. Angola’s macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Progress has been made in improving the compilation and dissemination of statistics, but gaps need to be addressed, particularly in national accounts, including publication of quarterly data, fiscal data, balance of payments, producer price indices, monetary statistics, and FSIs. </P><P MCID="5">40.

The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Also, large imbalances have emerged in the foreign exchange (forex) market amid lower export revenues. While Angola’s still comfortable level of international reserves will help contain near-term balance sheet risks, continued policy adjustment will be needed to strengthen the external position further. Gradual fiscal tightening should be implemented, and greater exchange rate flexibility supported by monetary policy tightening will be critical to orderly address forex imbalances, while structural reforms will be needed to enhance external competitiveness.  </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">A.   External Balance Sheets </P><P MCID="6">Angola’s net international investment position (NIIP) was positive at about 4 percent of GDP at  end-2015, primarily due to large level of official reserve assets. The negative contribution from debt has been on the rise, reflecting increasing public sector external borrowing. Projected current account deficits through the medium term in the context of low international oil prices means that the NIIP will continue to fall although near-term balance sheet risks will remain contained due to comfortable level of international reserves.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">  </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">-100-80-60-40-20020406080100120Portfolio equity assetsPortfolio equity liabilitiesFDI assetsFDI liabilitiesDebt assetsDebt liabilitiesFX Reserves minus goldNet IIPAngola: IIP Composition, by Instrument(In percent of GDP)Source: Angolan authorities and Fund staff calculations.</P><P MCID="13">-80-60-40-2002040Portfolio equityFDIDebtFX Reserves minus goldTotalAngola: Net IIP Composition, by Instrument(In percent of GDP)Source: Angolan authorities and Fund staff calculations.</P></page>

Current Account </P><P MCID="1">Angola’s current account (CA) balance has deteriorated to a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting the prolonged fall in international oil prices and limited non-oil exports. In particular, the trade surplus shrank from 33½ percent of GDP in 2013, before the oil price decline, to 12 percent of GDP in 2015 as the value of oil exports halved during the same period. The CA deficit is estimated to have improved to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2016 due to import compression as a result of the ongoing fiscal tightening and forex rationing by the BNA. In the baseline scenario, further improvements in the CA deficit over the medium term will be limited by an overvalued exchange rate. Consequently, the CA deficit is projected to narrow only to 3¾ percent of GDP by 2021 despite the expected modest recovery in international oil prices and improvements in the fiscal balance.  </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Staff assesses that Angola’s 2015 CA was substantially weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The External Balance Assessment Lite (EBA-lite) estimates a cyclically adjusted CA norm of about 0.2 percent of GDP and a CA gap of about -8¾ percent of GDP.11 The adjusted EBA-lite (Oil EBA-lite), estimated based on a sample of oil dependent economies,12 shows a relatively lower CA gap (about -7½ percent of GDP) with a CA norm of about  -0.3 percent of GDP. The gap could narrow this year, to about -3 percent of GDP, due to the expected improvement in the CA balance. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">C.   Exchange Rate and Competitiveness </P><P MCID="6">Despite a sizable (22 percent) depreciation in the average nominal official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, the average real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated only 3 percent in 2015, due to high inflation in Angola relative to its trading partners and depreciation of the currencies of other trading partners against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, the average nominal exchange rate in the parallel market depreciated 70 percent, reflecting much reduced sales of forex by the BNA as a result of the sharp drop in oil exports and restrictions imposed by the BNA, leading to the widening </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="7">11 The results should be interpreted with caution since a large portion of the gap reflects regression residuals. </P><P MCID="8">12 Behar, Alberto and Armand Fouejieu (2016).

The Oil EBA-lite CA regression result shows a higher REER overvaluation (54 percent) due to a lower elasticity of CA to changes in the REER.13 The fact that all of the estimates point to overvaluation, albeit variations in the estimated size of the overvaluation reflecting uncertainties in estimation methods, is consistent with a positive spread between the parallel and official and market exchange rates, although the very large and volatile spread probably reflects the fact that the parallel market is still thin. Despite a 39 percent, y-o-y, depreciation in the official nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the REER depreciated only about 4¾ percent, y-o-y, during January-October 2016 due to high inflation in Angola. While this might have corrected some of the REER gaps observed in 2015, the dynamics of the REER in the second half of the year indicates that these gains could have likely been erased by the end of 2016.14  </P><P MCID="10">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="11">13 The Oil EBA-lite method assumes a CA elasticity to REER of 0.14 compared to the 0.21 used in the standard EBA-lite method.  </P><P MCID="12">14 The REER appreciated 20 percent between April and October 2016 as the nominal official exchange rate has been fixed in the context of high inflation.

Capital Flows and Policy Measures </P><P MCID="1">Angola’s CA deficit is financed largely by long-term borrowing, primarily by the public sector, and foreign direct investment (FDI). A large share of the FDI flows to (from) Angola reflect liquidity managements by oil companies in the context of lack of local capital markets. As a result, net FDI inflows tend to move counter-cyclically with the price of oil. When the price of oil falls, residents (predominantly Sonangol) reduce their investment abroad and non-resident oil companies draw funding from their deposits abroad, leading to an increase in FDI inflows (as in 2009, 2014, and 2015). On the other hand, FDI outflows increase when the oil price increases (e.g., during 2010-13) as residents’ foreign asset holdings increase and non-resident oil companies increase their deposits abroad.  </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">Other financial flows, such as portfolio investment, trade credits, and currency and deposits mostly reflect investments of public sector funds abroad and banking sector activities for facilitating international trade. Non-residents’ investment in Angola is limited to FDI and, most recently, purchases of long-term government securities issued abroad as the country has virtually closed capital account for other flows and due to limited investment opportunities. As a result of these, the risk of reversal of capital flows in Angola is very limited. </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">E.   Foreign Exchange Intervention and Reserve Levels </P><P MCID="6">Angola’s forex market is a one-sided market, where the BNA is the only supplier. Notwithstanding recent upticks, supply from the BNA has fallen significantly from about US$1.8 billion per month, on average, during January-November 2015 to about US$0.9 billion per month during the same period in 2016, reflecting declines in oil export revenues and the BNA’s decision to protect, to some extent, its international reserves. Consequently, losses in net international reserves (NIR) have been moderate, while imbalances in the forex market have grown substantially.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">-20-15-10-505101520253020052006200720082009201020112012201320142015FDIPortfolioMLT loansOther 1/Financial flows, totalCurrent account balance1/ Includes trade credits, currency and deposits, and short term flows.Sources: Angolan authorities and Fund staff calculations.Angola: Net financial inflows and current account balance(In percent of GDP)</P><P MCID="9">0500100015002000250030003500Feb-14Apr-14Jun-14Aug-14Oct-14Dec-14Feb-15Apr-15Jun-15Aug-15Oct-15Dec-15Feb-16Apr-16Jun-16Aug-16Oct-16Angola: FX Purchase by Commercial Banks(4-weeks moving average)From their clientsFrom the BNALinear (From the BNA)Source: BNA.In US$ mns</P></page>

The assessment confirmed weak governance and transparency practices at the BNA, including lack of timely publication of annual financial statements. The assessment made recommendations to strengthen the control framework in the reserves management and internal audit areas, and to enhance the legal framework and independence of the central bank. Some progress has been made in addressing recommendations. Outstanding key recommendations include: (i) amending the BNA Law to align it with best international practices; (ii) implementing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); and  (iii) resolving remaining audit qualifications. The audited 2015 financial statements have yet to be published, as stipulated under the Safeguards Policy. </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">Exchange Arrangements: The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as ‘other managed’ since June 2015. However, the kwanza has been re-pegged to the U.S. dollar since mid-April 2016. The BNA closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations to maintain price stability in the economy and frequently intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions and direct sales. The BNA receives foreign currency from taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and also buys foreign exchange from oil companies who make payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. The BNA then sells the foreign currency to the market, with special focus on the oil and other priority sectors. The official exchange rate of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has declined by more than 40 percent since September 2014. International reserves have been used to smooth the depreciation, declining by US$6⅔ billion since September 2014, to US$20⅓ billion in November 2016 on a net basis. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates. </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Angola continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. The measures maintained pursuant to Article XIV are: (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for invisible transactions, such as travel, medical or educational allowances; and (ii) limits on unrequited transfers to foreign-based individuals and institutions. In addition, Angola maintains three exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(a) resulting from (i) the discriminatory application of the 0.015 percent stamp tax on foreign exchange operations; (ii) the operation of the priority list for access to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate; and (iii) a special tax of 10% on transfers to non-residents under contracts for foreign technical assistance or management services.2 Angola also maintains three multiple currency practices that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 3 arising from the lack of a mechanism to prevent potential spreads in excess of 2 percent emerging (i) between successful bids within the BNA’s foreign exchange auction; and (ii) for transactions that take place at the reference rate in place and the rate at which transactions take place in the foreign exchange auction on that day, and (iii) the discriminatory application of the 0.015 stamp tax on foreign exchange operations. </P><P MCID="5"> </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="6">1 For a description of the IMF Safeguards Assessment framework, see </P><Span MCID="7">http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/safe.htm</Span><P MCID="8">. </P><P MCID="9">2 See IMF Country Report No. 15/301. </P></page>

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance </P><P MCID="6"></P><P MCID="7">General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are concerns about data quality and timeliness and efforts are underway to strengthen the statistical base, including through technical assistance from the Fund and World Bank.  </P><P MCID="8">Angola now has several regular and informative statistical publications, reflecting significant progress in the provision of data and transparency in statistical reporting. Progress has been the strongest in the BNA and recently in the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Both now provide and publish much more extensive data on a timely basis. Data delivery and publication from the Ministry of Finance could be significantly improved. Data postings on the Ministry of Finance website include detailed revenues from the oil sector and diamond and reports on public finances with a certain lag. </P><P MCID="9"></P><P MCID="10">National Accounts: INE has released the national accounts for Angola for 2002-13. This is the first issuance of national accounts for Angola and includes annual data on output, expenditures, and income. The national accounts include annual GDP in current prices and volumes using chained-linking based on 2002 benchmarks. The Ministry of Planning is expected to continue issuing preliminary estimates and projections of annual GDP (output). A quarterly GDP series is in production and is expected to be finalized and published in 2017. Other important data bulletins are published by INE, including quarterly bulletins on business confidence, industrial production, and on merchandize trade. INE completed a national census count for 2014. This was the first census in the four decades since independence. The census questionnaire covered a substantial collection of information, mostly of a demographic and social nature. </P><P MCID="11"></P><P MCID="12">Price Statistics: INE publishes monthly reports on consumer and wholesale price indices. The CPI index was expanded to include consumer prices in all 18 provinces of the country. INE has started to develop import and export price indices. </P><P MCID="13"></P><P MCID="14">Government Finance Statistics: The timeliness and quality of government finance statistics needs to be substantially improved. Revenue and expenditures are correctly recorded on accrual basis but some issues persist when operations above- and below-the-line are reconciled. Of the utmost importance is that consolidated and detailed fiscal data are published regularly (at least quarterly) in electronic format at the Ministry of Finance web page. It would also be important to publish the data in excel—currently published in PDF, rendering it difficult for analysis—and in nominal values (rather than percentage changes) and updating the numbers as they are revised. Information on oil revenues is published monthly with great detail but it would be more useful for analysts and stakeholders if it is published as a spreadsheet instead of PDF images. A detailed report on the evolution of oil revenues is published on a quarterly basis but with some lag. It would be important to start publishing data on non-oil revenue on a monthly basis. Thus far, the Ministry of Finance reports on a “modified” GFSM 1986 by using an adjustor to reconcile numbers above </P><P MCID="15"></P><P MCID="16"></P></page>

The data are now based on the new standardized report forms. The BNA delivers data to the IMF on a timely basis. It also publishes comprehensive data on its webpage on a monthly basis. The BNA also publishes other reports. These include a quarterly inflation report as well as its annual report (summarizing monetary and macroeconomic as well as inflation developments), and a six-monthly financial stability report (assessing the stability of the financial system) but those publications are published with a long lag.  </P><P MCID="3"></P><P MCID="4">Financial Sector Surveillance: BNA data on financial soundness indicators are published on a monthly basis. The quality of financial soundness indicators should be improved along with the recommendations from STA technical assistance. The usefulness of the BNA’s Financial Stability Report could be enhanced by being more up to date, as the last report was published in early 2015. </P><P MCID="5"></P><P MCID="6">External Sector Statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position are compiled in line with the recommendations of the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. These statistics are compiled and disseminated annually, with a lag of about nine months after the reference period. A technical assistance mission from STA on external sector statistics was conducted in November 2015. It reviewed the implementation of the recommendations of previous TA missions and found that progress has been made, especially regarding the automatization of the compilation process. The mission made recommendations on the compilation procedures and the coverage and quality of the series to improve the consistency between flows and stocks. The mission also confirmed the availability of quarterly information already collected by the BNA for the great majority of the elements of the balance of payments. Data coverage and timeliness remain major shortcomings. Also, coordination among statistical agencies and source data suppliers needs to be addressed.   </P><P MCID="7"></P><P MCID="8">II.

The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 24¾ percentage points during 2015, to 65½ percent at end-year, due to the fiscal deficit and effect of the exchange rate depreciation on foreign currency denominated and indexed debt. This ratio is expected to increase to 71½ percent at end-2016 given the projected fiscal deficit of 4 percent of GDP for the year and a more depreciated exchange rate. Despite projected subdued real GDP growth, the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline in 2017 mainly due to the projected real exchange rate appreciation, and then stabilize at around 64 percent mainly due to projected improvements in the fiscal balances.

Angola’s gross public debt is estimated at 65½ percent of GDP at end-2015. Public debt statistics comprise the central government and (the external debt of) the state-owned oil and airline companies (Sonangol and TAAG, respectively).1 There was a 24¾ percentage point of GDP increase in gross public debt in 2015 relative to 2014, due to a fiscal deficit of about 3⅓ percent of GDP, the effect of the exchange rate depreciation on foreign currency denominated and indexed debt stocks—which accounted for 9½ percentage point of GDP increase in public debt. Net public debt (gross debt excluding deposits of the central government at the BNA) stood at 54¼ percent of GDP at end-2015.2 </P><P MCID="4">2.      In 2016, Angola’s gross public debt is projected to have continued to increase, by 6¼ percentage points, to 71½ percent of GDP. This is driven by the projected fiscal deficit of  4 percent of GDP for the year and the effect of a more depreciated exchange rate on foreign currency denominated and indexed debt stocks. </P><P MCID="5">3.      The main assumptions underlying the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are fully in line with the baseline macroeconomic scenario outlined in the Article IV Staff Report. After negative growth in 2016, staff projects a very gradual increase in non-oil GDP growth until 2019 and stable but subdued growth thereafter, reflecting improved terms-of-trade, a moderately improved business climate, and the completion of several projects in agriculture and infrastructure. Inflation is projected to remain high in 2016 and then decline gradually. The non-oil primary fiscal balance is projected to improve only starting in 2018—due to projected higher public spending in 2017—to preserve debt sustainability given that international oil prices are expected to improve but remain significantly lower than in 2011–13. The external current account deficit would be reduced over the medium term due to fiscal retrenchment and higher oil prices. </P><P MCID="6">4.      Staff estimates public debt as a share of GDP to decline in 2017 due to the projected appreciation of the real exchange rate,3 and to stabilize thereafter reflecting improvements in fiscal balances, and despite projected subdued real GDP growth. As the government continues its fiscal consolidation efforts, the debt ratio would stabilize at about 64 percent.4 This fiscal consolidation would be achieved mainly through additional nonoil taxation and expenditure savings. </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="7">1 Sonangol’s external debt (14¼ percent of GDP at end-2015) is included in public debt given that Sonangol is fully state-owned. Most of its debt does not carry an explicit government guarantee, but disbursements in 2016 amounting to US$6.9 billion from the China Development Bank (CDB), which were on-lent by the central government to Sonangol, are explicitly guaranteed. In net terms, this was equivalent to about US$3.8 billion given that part of this loan was used to refinance existing debt. </P><P MCID="8">2 Part of central government deposits at the BNA, which include the oil funds, could be used to reduce financing needs but under very strict conditions and with the approval of the President of the Republic. </P><P MCID="9">3 The projected decline in the public debt ratio in 2017 is due to the still high expected inflation and the authorities’ commitment to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate. </P><P MCID="10">4 The residuals from the contribution to changes in both public and external debt are mainly due to further projected exchange rate depreciation of the kwanza in 2018-21 but at a slower pace than in 2015-16. </P><P MCID="11"></P></page>

Angola’s moderate debt burden and gross financing needs can pose risks to debt sustainability and leave debt dynamics highly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. Angola’s debt ratio is projected to exceed in 2016 (but not in subsequent years) the debt burden benchmark for emerging economies of 70 percent of GDP. Angola’s public gross financing needs are expected to be slightly above the relevant benchmark of 15 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2019–20.  </P><P MCID="1">6.      Angola’s key macroeconomic variables forecast track record shows a relatively large median error compared with advanced and emerging market surveillance countries in some years. This is partly due to unforeseen developments, including volatility in either oil production or oil prices and swings in agricultural production due to weather conditions. This also reflects the low level of diversification of the economy and still weak fiscal institutions. </P><P MCID="2">7.      The baseline debt path is vulnerable to various shocks, including on real GDP growth, exchange rate, financial contingent liability, and oil price.5 </P><P MCID="3"> Growth shock: If projected real GDP rates are lowered by half standard deviation (implying lower real growth by about 4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018), the debt ratio would reach  72¾ percent of GDP in 2018 and stabilize thereafter at around 73 percent:6  </P><P MCID="4"> Real exchange rate shock: A one-off real depreciation of 30 percent (45 percent nominal depreciation) would alter the debt-to-GDP path significantly, with this ratio reaching 74¾ percent of GDP in 2017 before declining slightly to 74½ percent in 2021. </P><P MCID="5"> Combined shock: A combination of various (standard and non-standard) macro-fiscal shocks would increase debt to 101½ percent of GDP by 2021.  </P><P MCID="6"> Financial sector contingent liability shock: A one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio to  73½ percent by 2018 and stabilize thereafter around 74 percent. </P><P MCID="7"> Oil price shock: Given Angola’s high dependence on oil, an oil price shock representing a  30 percent drop in the projected price of the Angolan oil basket in 2017 was also considered. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase in 2017 compared to the baseline and stabilize at 66½ percent.7 </P><P MCID="8">  </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                   </Artifact><P MCID="9">5 The interest rate shock applied for Angola increases by 200 basis points rather than by the maximum real interest rate over the last 10 years to exclude the outlier resulting from the 2008-09 global crisis, which distorts the impact of the shock on public debt. </P><P MCID="10">6 The real GDP growth is reduced by one-half standard deviation (rather than 1 standard deviation) for 2 consecutive years to tailor this shock better to the new reality of the Angolan economy, which has been growing for more than a decade and has seen the share of the less volatile non-oil (services dominated) sector increase. </P><P MCID="11">7 The oil price shock shows only the direct impact of a decline in oil price on revenues in 2017.

Introduction </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Angola has made commendable progress in addressing its post-conflict development challenges, including gaps in basic infrastructure and limited human capital development, needed to spur long-term growth. The implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, over the past several years, yielded steady growth, improved socio-economic indicators, and paved the way for continued improvements in institutions. Reaping the benefits from the oil sector to upgrade the productive capacity required to diversify the sources of economic growth is essential to reduce risks from commodity price swings. More recently, the authorities have made significant adjustments in the macroeconomic policy mix to withstand the adverse impact of the oil price shock, coupled with the sluggish growth in emerging markets and tightening financial conditions. Going forward, they are committed to advance the reform agenda to build strong macroeconomic fundamentals, accelerate economic diversification, and strengthen policy institutions. They broadly concur with the staff assessment and policy recommendations, appreciate the Fund’s continued engagement and policy advice as well as the candid policy discussions during the 2016 Article IV Consultation. </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">2. Recent Economic Developments  </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The Angolan economy is adapting to a “new normal” characterized by the lower commodity price cycle since mid-2014.  Given the country’s dependence on oil, economic performance is intrinsically determined by oil price developments. </P><P MCID="11"> </P><P MCID="12">Economic activity stagnated in 2016, after growing at 3.0 percent in 2015, primarily driven by the slowdown in the oil sector to 0.8 percent in 2016, from 6.4 percent in 2015. In addition, the shortage of foreign exchange to finance imports of intermediate and capital goods needed for production of nontradables, a weakening in private sector activity, and the scaling back of public infrastructure investment weighted negatively on growth. </P><P MCID="13"> </P><P MCID="14">Inflation reached 41.2 percent in December 2016, year-on-year (y-o-y), largely driven by the pass-through effect of depreciation of the local currency during the period of rebalancing of the foreign exchange market. The heightened inflationary pressures in 2016 were also induced by the lagged effects of the phasing out of fuel subsidies in 2015 and 2016. The kwanza depreciated by roughly 60 percent against the U.S. dollar during the period 2015–2016. To contain inflation pressures and gradually address imbalances in the foreign exchange market, the Central Bank of Angola (BNA) raised its policy rate by 200 basis points to 14 percent in June 2016, relative to January 2016. Likewise, the standing lending facility rate was raised from 14 to 20 percent, and the standing deposit facility rate was increased from 2.25 to 7.25 percent, over the same period. These measures contributed to reducing the excess liquidity and preserving reserve buffers.  </P></page>

The supplementary budget for 2016 scaled back public expenditures and concurrently protected the fiscal space for social programs. Further, deficit-reducing measures were implemented, particularly, the phasing out of fuel subsidies and rationalization of recurrent expenditures, mostly wages and goods and services. To insulate the economy against oil price volatility and prevent the risk of debt distress, the authorities agreed to take further actions aimed at achieving over the medium term a non-oil primary fiscal consolidation path needed to rebuild fiscal buffers. </P><P MCID="2"> </P><P MCID="3">The external current account deficit is projected to narrow to 4 percent of GDP in 2016, from 10 percent of GDP in 2015, on account of weaker economic activity, while gross international reserves are projected to remain at comfortable levels in 2016, at US$ 22.7 billion (roughly 8 months of prospective imports), against US$ 24.4 billion in 2015 (11 months of prospective imports). </P><P MCID="4"> </P><P MCID="5">3. Medium Term Economic Outlook and Policy Priorities </P><P MCID="6"> </P><P MCID="7">The medium term economic outlook for Angola remains favorable although the balance of risks is tilted to the downside. The key risks include the lingering low oil prices, slower growth in emerging markets, and tightening financial conditions. These risks will be mitigated through swift implementation of the recently launched program of action (Programas Dirigidos) targeted at sectors with high import-substitution and export potential, specifically agriculture, food processing, fisheries, and light manufacturing.  </P><P MCID="8"> </P><P MCID="9">Economic growth is projected to pick up to 2.1 percent in 2017, driven by the recovery of the oil sector and expected rebound in the non-oil sector, with growth rates estimated at 1.8 and 2.3 percent, respectively. The performance of the non-oil sector will be driven by accelerated growth in sectors of agriculture (7.3 percent), manufacturing (4.0 percent), construction (2.3 percent), and electricity (40.2 percent), which account for a substantial share of GDP. The authorities’ growth projections for 2017 are slightly higher than those of staff on account of different assumptions regarding the availability of financing for public infrastructure investments to increase the capacity for power generation, particularly: (i) construction of phases 1 and 2 of the Cambambe hydropower plant, with capacity to generate 960 megawatts; and (ii) construction of the Lauca hydropower plant, with a planned capacity of 1,320 megawatts.  </P><P MCID="10"> </P><P MCID="11">Like most resource-rich nations, Angola’s main challenges over the next few years are accelerating the pace of economic transformation and diversification, improving human capital development, and strengthening institutions. To achieve this, the authorities approved in January 2016, a Program of Action for Economic Diversification to withstand the oil price shock and invigorate the implementation of the National Development Plan (2013–017), which seeks to unlock the country’s growth potential and propel broad-based growth. </P><P MCID="12"> </P><P MCID="13">  </P></page>
<page id="68" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"><Artifact Attached="[/Top]" Subtype="/Header" Type="/Pagination">3 </Artifact><P MCID="0">Fiscal Policy </P><P MCID="1"> </P><P MCID="2">The authorities’ medium term fiscal strategy seeks to foster fiscal consolidation and step up the implementation of structural reforms to improve domestic revenue mobilization and strengthen public financial management. The draft budget for 2017 approved by the National Assembly on December 16, 2016 envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP, and is consistent with the medium term objective of promoting growth, while preserving debt sustainability. More specifically, over the short to medium term, the authorities will continue the implementation of fiscal reforms aimed at diversifying the sources of non-oil revenues, through measures aimed at widening the tax base, improving tax inspections, and better enforcing real estate taxation. In addition, they will accelerate ongoing preparatory steps to create an adequate institutional capacity and put in place appropriate IT infrastructure for the introduction of VAT. Similarly, upgrading the institutional capacity for investment planning and implementation, while improving the medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) will be given primacy going forward. Further, the authorities will enhance the institutional capacity for oversight of fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and accelerate the program of their restructuring and privatization, which includes closing 48 and privatizing 53 SOEs.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">The BNA policy priorities remain geared towards achieving price stability and rebalancing the foreign exchange market. The authorities are conscious that further tightening in the monetary policy stance while allowing greater exchange rate flexibility are essential to safeguard macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, given the economy’s structural rigidities and its heavy reliance on imports, a gradual approach to achieve exchange rate flexibility is desirable to prevent escalation of inflationary pressures. The BNA will continue to fine tune its monetary policy framework to strengthen credibility, and step up the implementation of measures aimed at improving the capacity for liquidity forecasting and management, and upgrading macro-prudential regulations. As the economy improves, the authorities are committed to take decisive steps to remove the restrictions on forex transactions. In addition, further steps to improve effectiveness of monetary policy will be taken, in particular narrowing the policy interest corridor to 500 bps to better signal the monetary policy decisions and shifting to base money targeting to achieve the inflation objective.  </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">Financial Sector Policy </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">Building a sound financial system and fostering financial deepening and inclusion are vital to support the ongoing efforts to propel inclusive-growth and foster economic diversification. To prevent the systemic risks arising from the deterioration in asset quality and lack of compliance with the minimum capital requirements by systemic-important banks, the BNA will continue to enhance the regulatory and supervisory frameworks and strengthen its crisis management tools. In relation to this, the authorities have made significant efforts in addressing the recommendations from the 2012 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA). Specifically, they have: (i) completed the restructuring of BNA’s supervisory functions with specific departments for banking supervision, regulation, foreign exchange supervision, and consumer protection; (ii) created a financial stability committee within the </P></page>

Specifically, over the past months, the BNA intensified its data collection and analysis efforts to ensure compliance with data provision on CBRs by the banking sector, and has been actively engaged in high-level policy dialogue with global correspondent banks in order to better understand the expectations and regulatory environment around CBRs. In this regard, actions are currently underway to enhance the supervisory and regulatory prudential frameworks and enforce mechanisms in line with international best practices. Further, the BNA has been engaged in open policy dialogue with private institutions on measures needed to address the withdrawal of CBRs and enhance the country’s AML/CFT framework as well as increase awareness.  </P><P MCID="3"> </P><P MCID="4">Structural Policies </P><P MCID="5"> </P><P MCID="6">Addressing the longstanding structural impediments to economic competitiveness and accelerating economic diversification and transformation remain critical policy challenges facing Angola over the medium and long term. Policy priorities in the structural front will be centered on augmenting the fiscal space for growth-inducing expenditures, while enhancing human capital development. In this vein, the authorities will step up efforts to quickly bolster the non-oil sector through invigoration of structural measures to ease the binding constraints to broad-based growth. They will also improve the business environment, including accelerating the implementation of the new Business Law, the new Labor Law, and approved decrees to facilitate startups, eliminate red tape, and unlock opportunities for small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). </P><P MCID="7"> </P><P MCID="8">4. Conclusion </P><P MCID="9"> </P><P MCID="10">The Angolan authorities have made notable efforts to advance their reform agenda aimed at withstanding the short-term vulnerabilities brought about by the protracted oil price shock and improving economic resilience and competiveness. The policy adjustment efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability and promote economic growth will continue, particularly through increased fiscal space for growth-friendly public investments needed to reduce the country’s dependence on the oil sector. To this end, continued Fund engagement and policy advice remain critical in supporting the authorities’ development agenda going forward. </P></page>
