In 2016, growth slowed due to a sharp contraction in agricultural output and subdued non-agricultural activity. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.6 percent in Q3 2016 while youth unemployment remains high at 21.8 percent. Headline inflation (year-on-year) reached 1.6 percent, reflecting higher food and energy prices.   External imbalances have fallen substantially since 2012, even though the current account deficit increased to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016, against 2.2 percent in 2015. Strong manufacturing and agriculture exports, and a rebound in tourism and remittances, have more than offset the impact of increased equipment and food imports and low phosphate prices. As a result, and with continued robust foreign direct investment (FDI), international reserves strengthened to about seven months of imports.  Fiscal consolidation has continued with a deficit down from 4.4 percent in 2015 to about 4 percent of GDP against the objective of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2016. This reflects resilient tax                                                    1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. International Monetary Fund 700 19th Street, NW Washington, D.

Banks are well capitalized and have stable funding, but nonperforming loans are rising and credit concentration risks, while declining, are still elevated. The expansion of Moroccan banks into Sub-Saharan Africa opens new channels of risk transmission, but cooperation with host country supervisors is intensifying and supervisory requirements for cross-border activities are being upgraded.   Morocco’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with growth expected to rebound to 4.4 percent in 2017 and reach 4.5 percent by 2021. However, risks remain substantial, and relate mainly to growth in advanced and emerging countries, geopolitical tensions in the region, world energy prices, and global financial market volatility. Stronger medium-term growth will hinge on continued implementation of comprehensive reforms with regard to labor participation and labor market efficiency, access to finance, quality education, public spending efficiency, and further improvements to the business environment. Continued poverty reduction, and lower regional and gender disparities, will also be crucial to achieve higher, sustainable and more inclusive growth.  Executive Board Assessment2  Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic policies and reforms, which have helped reduce domestic and external vulnerabilities, enhance the fiscal and financial policy frameworks, and increase economic diversification. Directors noted that, while the medium-term outlook is favorable, risks remain elevated. Against this backdrop, they welcomed the authorities’ continued strong commitment to sound policies, and encouraged them to sustain their reform efforts to further reduce vulnerabilities and promote stronger job creation and more inclusive growth.                                                      2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

<page id="3" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"> 3  Directors commended the continued progress made in fiscal consolidation, particularly the recent containment of current spending, the energy subsidy reform, and the reform of the public pension system. Going forward, they encouraged the authorities to gradually reduce the level of public debt over the medium term while preserving pro-growth and social spending. Directors agreed that efforts should focus on accelerating tax reforms to broaden the tax base and on careful and well-planned implementation of the fiscal decentralization to mitigate any related fiscal risks. Directors also encouraged the authorities to reform the civil service to help contain the public wage bill.  Directors endorsed the currently accommodative monetary policy stance in the context of moderate inflation and the nascent credit growth recovery. They supported the authorities’ intention to move gradually to a more flexible exchange rate regime and a new monetary policy framework, which will help preserve competitiveness and better insulate the economy against shocks. In this regard, Directors concurred that the conditions for a successful transition in 2017 are in place. Directors also encouraged the authorities to submit to parliament the draft central bank law, which will strengthen Bank Al-Maghrib’s (BAM) independence and expand its roles in the promotion of financial stability and inclusion.   Directors welcomed that the banking sector remains sound and well capitalized, and stressed that rising non-performing loans, credit concentration risks, and the expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa require continued monitoring. They also welcomed BAM’s continued efforts to strengthen the financial regulatory and supervisory framework in line with 2015 Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations, including ongoing advances on cross-border bank oversight, more risk-based and forward looking supervision, a stronger macroprudential policy framework, and efforts to strengthen supervisory resources in view of expanding responsibilities.   Directors emphasized the importance of sustained implementation of structural reforms to promote higher and more inclusive growth. They recommended continued efforts to improve the business climate, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by enhancing their access to financing. Directors also called for improved labor market regulations as well as increased efficiency of public spending on education and vocational training that better </page>

Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to reinforce the governance and oversight of public enterprises, and looked forward to further progress in implementing the national strategy to fight corruption.     </page>

Macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2012 despite sluggish growth. In 2016, growth slowed due to a sharp contraction in agricultural output and subdued non-agricultural activity; the fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined to 3.5 percent of GDP; the current account deficit widened slightly to 2.9 percent of GDP; and international reserves strengthened to about seven months of imports. Reforms are advancing, including of the public pension system and the transition to a new exchange rate and monetary regime. Banks are adequately capitalized, but non-performing loans (NPLs) are increasing and credit concentration risks need to be reduced.    Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to rebound to 4.4 percent in 2017 and reach 4.5 percent over the medium term. Headline inflation is projected to be 1.2 percent in 2017 and stabilize at about 2 percent thereafter, while the external position would continue to improve. Medium-term prospects are favorable, but risks remain substantial, and relate mainly to growth in advanced and emerging countries, geopolitical tensions in the region, world energy prices, and global financial market volatility.  Policy discussions. Prudent macroeconomic policies and continued reforms, as well as declining international oil prices, have helped to reduce domestic and external vulnerabilities in recent years. However, the reform momentum needs to be maintained in order to reach higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth so as to reduce youth unemployment. The 2016 Article IV discussions focused on: (i) strengthening domestic stability, including fiscal and macro-financial sustainability; (ii) safeguarding external resilience with the transition to a new exchange rate and monetary regime; and (iii) raising growth potential and job creation while promoting inclusion.

Decisive policies and reforms have helped improve macroeconomic conditions in recent years, but important challenges remain in raising growth and employment. The authorities have successfully reduced domestic and external vulnerabilities, enhanced the fiscal and financial policy frameworks, and supported economic diversification (see Annex I). As a result, fiscal and current account deficits have declined, and the medium-term outlook is favorable. Yet, external risks remain elevated, and continued efforts are needed to further reduce vulnerabilities and promote stronger and more inclusive growth. The IMF supports the authorities’ program through the successor two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement approved in July 2016. This arrangement provides insurance against external risks and supports efforts to strengthen fiscal sustainability, transition toward greater exchange rate flexibility, and promote higher growth so as to reduce unemployment.  A.   Recent Developments 2. Following the parliamentary elections held on October 7, 2016, policy continuity is expected. The incumbent Justice and Development Party (PJD) won the highest number of seats. Therefore, the current Head of Government will lead the future government. Discussions on a new coalition government are still underway, but it is likely to involve the same political parties as in the current government, and staff believes that current policy and reform commitments will be maintained.   3. Growth has slowed in 2016, while youth unemployment remains high. Growth has been sluggish since the global financial crisis, as non-agricultural activity remained subdued. In 2016, a sharp contraction in agricultural output and lower non-agricultural activity than projected at the time of the PLL request should reduce growth to 1.5 percent. However, economic indicators point to stronger non-agricultural activity in the second half of 2016. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.6 percent in Q3-2016 from 10.1 percent in the same period of last year, while youth unemployment increased to 21.8 percent from 21.4 percent in the same period of last year.  4. The fiscal deficit is expected to be further reduced in 2016, to 3.5 percent of GDP, and public debt is sustainable. After culminating at 7.3 percent of GDP in 2012, the deficit was reduced to 4.5 percent in 2015 through strong policies, including energy subsidy reforms, resilient public revenues, and well contained public expenditures. In 2016, tax revenues performed better than projected, but grant revenues (mostly from Gulf countries) were lower than anticipated (39 percent of expected amount at end-October).

Public debt is sustainable and expected to peak at 64.3 percent of GDP in 2016.  5. Monetary policy remains accommodative. After declining to 0.3 percent in January 2016 (y-o-y), headline inflation reached 1.6 percent in October due to increasing food and energy prices, while core inflation increased to 1.1 percent. Average inflation is projected to remain at around 1.6 percent in 2016. Bank-Al-Maghrib (BAM) lowered its policy rate to 2.25 percent in March 2016, the first reduction since end-2014.  6. Credit growth has recently started to recover as economic activity is picking up. Following a credit boom in the mid-2000s, the credit to GDP ratio grew below trend, particularly after 2012 (Box 1).1 Credit growth picked up only recently, reaching 4 percent in September (y-o-y). These trends have reflected a combination of corporate deleveraging and increasing household indebtedness in recent years, the latter becoming relatively large by emerging market (EM) standards (based on ratios to GDP and household income). With stronger economic activity in the second half of the year, investment lending has been a key driver of credit growth more recently. Mortgage lending remains moderate (about 5 percent y-o-y) and there is no indication of a housing price bubble.  7. Banks are well capitalized, but rising non-performing loans, credit concentration risks, and expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are sources of concern (see flow chart). Banks’ regulatory capital ratio stood at 13.7 percent in 2015. Profitability declined during 2010–15 but recovered in 2016. While provisioning levels are high, NPLs have been rising since 2012, reaching 8 percent in September 2016 (against 7.4 percent in 2015), driven by weak economic activity and strains in parts of the corporate sector, including in construction. The banking system also remains vulnerable to credit concentration risks: despite strict regulatory limits and declining aggregate exposure (302 percent of T1 capital against 341 in 2014), stress test results suggest that the failure of the top three largest corporate exposures (mostly SOEs) may lead to the under-capitalization of several banks. Finally, the expansion of Moroccan banks into SSA provides diversification and profit opportunities, but also opens new channels of risk transmission, as such riskier cross-border exposures now account for about 20 percent of their assets, and some banks are systemically important in certain host countries.  8. The current account deficit has widened in 2016, but reserves continue to strengthen. The current account deficit is expected to reach 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016 against 2.2 percent in 2015. This reflects increased machinery and food imports, and weaker export growth, as the impact                                                    1 See also Selected Issues Paper on “Morocco—Credit Growth: Demand or Supply Driven?” 951001051101151202003Q42004Q32005Q22006Q12006Q42007Q32008Q22009Q12009Q42010Q32011Q22012Q12012Q42013Q32014Q22015Q12015Q42016Q3Real Estate Index, 2003Q4-2016Q3(2006Q1 = 100)Sources: Bank Al-Maghrib; and IMF staff estimates.</page>

Tourism and remittances revenues have rebounded in 2016, offsetting lower-than-expected official grants from GCC countries, while FDI inflows remain sizeable. Reserves strengthened further and should reach 100 percent of the Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric by the end of 2016 (or 131 percent the adjusted ARA metric). The net international investment position (NIIP) is expected to decline slightly to -62½ percent of GDP, while external debt, amounting to 32.4 percent of GDP, should remain moderate and sustainable. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated marginally since  mid-2015, increasing 3.7 percent (y-o-y) at end-November 2016 due to the strengthening of the US dollar. The IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) indicates that the external position is broadly aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals and policies (Annex II).2  Morocco. Key Macro-Financial Linkages                                                    2 The IMF’s EBA methodology includes three approaches to evaluating the external position relative to fundamentals and desirable policies: (i) the current account approach suggests a current account gap of -0.9 percent of GDP relative to the norm, equivalent to an REER overvaluation of 3.1 percent (compared to 7 percent in Spring 2016); (ii) the external sustainability approach suggests an REER undervaluation of 9.7 percent; however this estimate tends to be very sensitive to the underlying benchmark on net foreign assets; (iii) the REER approach suggests an undervaluation of 6.4 percent, but data limitations affect the robustness of this estimate. Given measurement issues in the latter two approaches, staff’s preferred approach is the current account approach, which suggests that on balance, the dirham is broadly aligned with fundamentals.  </page>

Growth is expected to increase gradually and the external position to remain strong in the medium term:   In 2017, growth should rebound to 4.4 percent due mainly to the base effect on agricultural activity. In the medium term, it is expected to reach 4.5 percent, with potential output increasing by an estimated one percentage point relative to 2016, driven by higher capital accumulation and a pickup in productivity (Annex III). This latter trend assumes that the current government’s reform commitments are implemented, including improvements to the business environment, agricultural modernization and industrial diversification, and further integration into global value chains. Inflation is expected to remain low at 1.2 percent in 2017 and to increase to about 2 percent over the medium term. Consistent with the envisaged investment and GDP growth path, credit growth should pick-up over the medium-term to an average of 5 percent.   In 2017, the current account deficit is expected to decline to 2.3 percent of GDP. In the medium term, it is projected to remain in the range of 1.5–2 percent of GDP. Export growth would be driven by emerging sectors and stronger external demand, and a gradual recovery of phosphate prices. Imports would grow steadily, with low (but rising) oil prices. Tourism receipts would accelerate while remittances would remain robust. Sustained FDI inflows, in line with the dynamism of new industrial sectors, would also contribute to bring reserves over 115 percent of the ARA metric (151 percent of the adjusted metric) by 2021.  10. Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside (see Table 1). Despite increased economic diversification, growth will remain susceptible to agricultural output volatility. Weaker growth in the euro area, or in other emerging and frontier economies, could affect external demand. Adverse geopolitical developments in the Middle East and Europe, and their impact on tourism, also remain significant risks. Finally, more volatile financial conditions, together with protracted uncertainty about global trade policies, could affect investor confidence and banks’ correspondent relationships, with potential impact on financial intermediation, notably for trade credit and remittances. In terms of outward spillovers, the subsidiaries of Moroccan banks in SSA are systemically important in some host countries. On the domestic front, the new coalition government may make changes to some policies. 11. The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks in the RAM and the external sector assessment (Annex II), but viewed the impact of some of these risks as less severe, including risks of rising nationalism in large economies, fragmentation and security dislocation, and slower than expected pace of reforms. They also noted that there is upside growth potential as economic activity in Europe strengthens and current structural reforms bear fruit and help increasing diversification and moving up the value chain. They agreed that a higher growth path would require significant gains in productivity.   </page>

Building on recent fiscal and external improvements, the reform momentum needs to be maintained to secure longer-term stability and raise growth and employment (Appendix I). This will require:  Strengthening domestic stability;  Safeguarding external resilience; and,  Raising potential growth and job creation while promoting inclusion. A.   Strengthening Domestic Stability 13. The authorities continue to implement gradual fiscal consolidation despite recent shortfalls in grant revenues. The fiscal deficit objective of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2016 is estimated to have been met, including due to spending cuts (such as in wages and subsidies) to offset the grants shortfall observed again in 2016 (about 0.4 percent of GDP). In 2017, the deficit is expected to decline further to 3 percent of GDP, in line with projections at the time of PLL request. This would reflect: (i) reduced spending (in percent of GDP), primarily through contained spending on public wages and goods and services; and (ii) stable tax revenues, due mostly to weaker growth in 2016 and increased VAT refunds.3 Staff supported these objectives, which will allow to reduce public debt while preserving growth-friendly expenditures, and encouraged the authorities to identify short-term measures for 2017 to compensate for any grants shortfall.  14. While sustainable, public debt should be placed firmly on a downward path. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that public debt, which rose from 47 percent in 2009 to 64.3 percent in 2016, remains sustainable and resilient to various shocks (Annex IV), and below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets. Still, there are significant fiscal risks, including potential delays in reforms to raise potential growth in the years ahead. Staff and the authorities agreed to maintain the objective of reducing public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020, in order to increase fiscal space gradually, without affecting growth.  15. Reducing public debt will require fiscal reforms to bring the fiscal deficit to about 2.4 percent of GDP by 2020. Following important reforms to rein in public spending in recent years, including through energy subsidy reforms (and associated stronger social safety nets), the new organic budget law, and public pension reform, fiscal consolidation efforts going forward should focus on a few key reform areas:   Taxation. The authorities are implementing tax reforms in line with recommendations from the 2013 national tax conference (Box 2). Staff welcomed recent efforts, such as regarding the                                                    3 Projections of taxes on income, profits, and capital gains are based on last year’s revenues. The authorities project an increased VAT refund from 5.2 billion dirhams in 2016 to 7 billion dirhams in 2017. </page>
<page id="20" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 taxation of self-employed and liberal professions. Staff recommended that tax reforms, which could yield about 1.5–2 percent of additional public revenues over the medium term, be accelerated. A key priority is to broaden the tax base, including through fight against fiscal fraud, and reduced VAT and other tax exemptions (especially for large agricultural firms). In general, better communication on tax reforms, providing context for specific changes to the taxation regime, would also help make such reforms better accepted and more impactful. The authorities agreed that there is room to broaden the tax base and are committed to this reform.    Fiscal decentralization. The authorities are shifting increasing amounts of public resources to the regional level as part of their regionalization initiative. They are aware that there are important fiscal risks associated with fiscal decentralization, and that proper administrative capacity and checks and balances have to be in place to ensure sound public financial management at all levels. Indeed, they have taken action to strengthen local operational structures for regional development planning and project management, and to reinforce budgetary and financial procedures and controls for regions (Box 3). Staff supported these efforts, and welcomed the authorities’ interest in receiving Fund TA support on local taxation, capacity development, and fiscal management.     Civil service. The authorities intend to keep the public payroll below 10.5 percent of GDP over the medium term so as not to compromise priority spending. Several reforms have been pursued to achieve this objective, such as the recent introduction of contractual employment and increased personnel mobility across ministries. Staff welcomed these efforts and stressed the need for a comprehensive reform of the civil service in order to generate savings on public wage spending while increasing the efficiency of public services. Staff highlighted some options for this reform, including changes to civil service statutes aiming for more merit-based career progression, as well as changes to public wage structures. The authorities agreed that a comprehensive reform is needed.   Public enterprises. The authorities have taken steps to address potential state owned enterprise (SOE)-related fiscal risks for which specific provisions are missing from the Organic Budget Law. A draft law to reinforce the governance and oversight of public enterprises has been submitted to the cabinet for approval. The authorities also work on a consolidated SOEs balance sheet. Staff welcomed these plans while stressing the need to advance them expeditiously.  16. The accommodative monetary policy stance remains adequate. The policy rate cut in March 2016 was instrumental in supporting the nascent credit recovery, suggesting that monetary transmission is effective. Staff noted that in the baseline scenario, the current monetary policy stance would remain appropriate as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored. This is the case in particular for 2017, when inflation is expected to remain moderate reflecting a weather-related decline in food prices while economic activity is above potential. Since SME credit could be hampered by demand or supply constraints, staff supported continued initiatives by the authorities to provide SME credit guarantees and to address potential obstacles to SME credit access. The authorities noted that BAM’s main objective is inflation, and that credit growth has started to pick up while liquidity conditions are adequate.   </page>
<page id="21" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO 16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17. The financial system is resilient but key risk exposures require continued vigilance and reforms:  NPLs. The authorities intend to move forward in the first half of 2017 with several reforms consistent with FSAP recommendations, including: aligning loan classification and provisioning rules with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and formalizing and harmonizing the criteria for inclusion in supervisory “watch lists” (and implementing related tighter provisioning requirements). In addition, the future legal framework for collateral execution should help increase recovery rates.   Concentrated credit exposures. The authorities agree that large credit exposures continue to pose a risk and are taking action to reduce them. They issued a new directive in June 2016 requiring corporate groups to prepare consolidated financial statements including all existing debt, and specifying future borrowing plans. In addition, they are considering a further tightening of risk weights for large connected exposures.  18. More broadly, continued improvements to the financial sector policy framework are underway. Changes in the financial system, including its increasing complexity, the cross border expansion of Morocco’s banks, and the forthcoming exchange rate flexibility, require increased supervisory resources and a continuous shift to more risk-based and forward-looking supervision:   Supervisory capacity and resources. Efforts to increase supervisory resources and capacity are progressing, in line with FSAP recommendations. In addition to new recruitment, organizational changes were made in 2016, including the creation of specialized units dedicated to the oversight of systemic banks, cross-country exposures, and bank recovery plans. In preparation for the exchange rate transition, the authorities requested Fund TA support in assessing banks’ readiness to manage currency risks.   Macro prudential policy. This policy framework has been enhanced with the creation of a dedicated department at BAM, inter-agency discussions of financial stability issues at the level of the Systemic Risk Surveillance and Coordination Committee (CCSRS), and the introduction of the legal power to impose countercyclical capital buffers. Going forward, priorities include filling key data gaps for macro-prudential surveillance, such as sectoral data on loan-to-value ratios and debt-service-to-income ratios, and designing capital surcharges for systemic banks.   Crisis management and bank resolution. The authorities will start upgrading the legal framework for bank resolution, while ensuring its compatibility with broader Moroccan law. This effort will introduce key changes consistent with recent FSAP and Fund TA recommendations (including the “least-cost” principle, changes to the deposit guarantee scheme, and bail-in powers), but it is likely to take several months. As a result, BAM’s designation as the resolution authority will not be introduced in the central bank law to be approved in the next parliament session in 2017—but the new emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) framework will.  </page>
<page id="22" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17  Cooperation with host country supervisors. Such cooperation, aiming to supervise the cross border activities and exposures of Moroccan banks, has intensified. Formal arrangements have been established with bilateral and regional supervisory bodies (such as at the BCEAO and CEMAC) and supervisory colleges for all main banks are in place. The authorities also upgraded supervisory requirements for cross border activities, including in terms of country and sovereign risk management.   19. AML/CFT framework. The authorities are preparing for the evaluation of AML/CFT-related risks by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) in 2017. They are currently reviewing the potential need to adjust current legal frameworks in various parts of the financial system, in line with the latest changes introduced by the FATF. In particular, the authorities should continue to strengthen risk-based AML/CFT supervision, improve the availability of beneficial ownership information and enhance monitoring tools to mitigate cross-border AML/CFT risks, especially in the context of the banking sector’s expansion to the SSA region.  B.   Safeguarding External Resilience  20. The authorities have entered the final preparatory phase for the introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility in 2017. Greater exchange rate flexibility will increase the shock absorption capacity of the economy, particularly given current constraints on fiscal space. It will also help preserve competitiveness and better incentivize the reallocation of productive resources between the tradable and non-tradable sectors within the economy (Box 4).  21. The authorities and staff agreed that the current conditions in Morocco offer a unique window of opportunity for such a transition. While not without risks in a global context of volatile financial conditions, key pre-conditions are in place to ensure that Morocco can move from a position of strength, including: strong macroeconomic buffers and comfortable reserves; recently enhanced fiscal, monetary and financial policy frameworks; alignment of the exchange rate with fundamentals, which reduces the risk of large exchange rate adjustments; limited currency risk exposures in the economy, including low level of foreign currency-denominated public debt; relatively low estimated pass-through of exchange rate movements to consumer prices; and a pre-existing exchange rate market that already helps operators to manage the dirham’s volatility vis-a-vis individual currencies.   22. In preparation for the transition, the authorities have benefited from extensive Fund technical assistance, and they are now ready operationally. Technical assistance has helped the authorities prepare for the implementation of key technical and operational aspects of the transition, including: macro-economic modelling; forecasting and policy analysis; communication strategy; legal, institutional and regulatory structures; and foreign exchange market development.  23. Staff supports the authorities’ gradual approach, consisting in introducing an adjustable horizontal band, which will progressively dis-anchor the dirham from the current currency basket, foster the deepening of the foreign exchange market, and allow for monetary policy decisions to be increasingly based on inflation forecasts. Staff highlighted the importance of timely communication </page>
<page id="23" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO 18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND to manage economic agents’ expectations regarding the sequence and modalities of the transition. The authorities noted that their roadmap incorporates these aspects, including through regular meetings and outreach to banks, corporations and the general public.   24. Staff agreed with the authorities that the adoption of fully-fledged inflation targeting should be envisaged in the later stage of the exchange rate transition. In the meantime, maintaining the current monetary policy regime will help avoid any major conflict between the adoption of a formal inflation target and the existence of a still narrow exchange rate band. There was also agreement that restrictions on capital outflows by residents should not be eliminated in the short run, in order to minimize risks during at least the initial phases of the transition. C.   Raising Potential Growth and Job Creation while Promoting Inclusion 25. Addressing key constraints to growth can significantly raise Morocco’s growth potential (see Annex III). Staff’s analysis shows that the main obstacles to higher growth in Morocco are the quality of education, skills mismatches, governance and the business environment, and the functioning of the labor market. Their impact has been reflected in Morocco’s declining productivity and lower human capital levels, employment and labor force growth, compared to emerging market peers. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes that the ongoing reforms to improve the business environment and access to finance would increase potential output by about 1 percentage point in the medium term. However, it is estimated that more ambitious structural reforms to address all of the above constraints could increase potential growth by about 2 percentage points.  26. The business environment has improved but further progress is needed. Efforts have been made recently to simplify administrative procedures (such as for customs transactions, property rights, and enterprise creation), and to reduce payment delays from the public to the private sector. Morocco’s 2017 Doing Business ranking improved to 68 (against 75 in 2016). However, key reforms are still needed. Staff highlighted the importance of making the Competition Council operational by appointing all its members and of fighting corruption through a determined implementation of the recently-adopted national strategy. The authorities reiterated their commitment to business climate improvements and pointed to plans to further simplify administrative procedures, including by developing an e-regulation platform.  27. High youth unemployment, inadequate education outcomes and gender gaps are barriers to higher and more inclusive growth. Unemployment is high, especially among the youth (Box 5). Female labor force participation is very low, at 24.8 percent, and has declined in the past decade. These outcomes partly reflect poor education and skills mismatches, highlighting the importance of speeding up education and labor market reforms. In this context, staff reiterated the need to increase the efficiency of public spending on education and to enhance teachers’ training, recruitment, and evaluation, and also noted the need to foster public–private partnerships for curriculum design and apprenticeships, which could help align worker skills with private sector needs. The authorities shared staff’s assessment and highlighted their recent efforts to facilitate the deployment of teachers, as well as the recently-adopted strategy on vocational training, which is </page>

In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to consider relaxing restrictions on fixed-term contracts and layoffs in order to better integrate young workers in the labor market. Finally, staff stressed the need to strengthen policies to reduce gender gaps in education and labor force participation, including by investing in women’s education, child care facilities, safe transportation and removing gender discriminatory tax practices.5 28. SME access to finance is improving but challenges remain. The latest World Bank Enterprise Survey shows that firms with a line of credit have increased to 52 percent in 2013. Large enterprises have better access (72 percent) than SMEs (50 percent), but both ratios in Morocco are higher than the world and Middle East averages. Nonetheless, collateral requirements continue to be a constraint particularly for small enterprises. In addition to public mechanisms to support SME credit, staff welcomed the launch of a second credit bureau expected in January 2017. The authorities indicated that the draft law on collateral is ready for discussion and would play a key role in facilitating collateral enforcement through extra-judiciary procedures and thus further improving credit access for SMEs. Staff also encouraged the authorities to continue with efforts to bring Morocco’s insolvency regime in line with international best practices. STAFF APPRAISAL 29. Morocco’s sound macroeconomic policies and ongoing reforms have helped reduce vulnerabilities and increase the economy’s resilience. External and fiscal imbalances have decreased significantly in recent years, and international reserves are now comfortable. Key reforms have been implemented in the areas of public subsidies, fiscal management, financial oversight, and economic diversification. Most recently, the preparations for the transition to a new exchange rate and monetary regime have been finalized. Yet, growth remains sluggish and subject to agricultural volatility, but it is expected to rebound in 2017 and to strengthen gradually in the medium term.   30. In an environment still subject to elevated downside risks, and given domestic challenges, sustained reform implementation will be crucial. The economy remains vulnerable to global conditions, notably the risk of weaker growth in the euro area and emerging economies, adverse geopolitical developments in the Middle East and protectionist trade policies in large economies. In several areas, accelerating the pace of reforms will also be key to increase Morocco’s growth potential, achieving higher and more inclusive growth, and reducing persistent high unemployment levels, especially among the youth, while improving women’s participation in the labor force. Priority reform areas include further improvements to the business climate (particularly for SMEs), education, and labor market functioning. 31. The current macroeconomic policy mix consisting of fiscal consolidation and accommodative monetary policy continues to be appropriate. The fiscal deficit is expected to                                                    4 2015 Selected Issues Paper on “Efficiency of Public Spending on Education in Morocco.” 5 2016 Selected Issue Paper on “Morocco: Implications of Gender Inequality for Growth.” </page>

It will further consolidate in 2017 with stable tax revenues and contained current spending. Since inflation expectations remain well-anchored, the current monetary policy stance would remain adequate and support a gradual pick-up in credit growth.  32. Over the medium term, further fiscal consolidation will be required to put public debt firmly on a downward path. Even if sustainable, public debt is relatively high, and reducing it to 60 percent of GDP by 2020 will be key to create fiscal space for social and growth-enhancing expenditures. Building on progress in reining in public spending in recent years, including energy subsidy reforms, efforts should focus on accelerating tax reforms by broadening the tax base and promoting greater tax efficiency, equity, and simplicity; gradually implementing fiscal decentralization in order to introduce all needed safeguards; enhancing the governance and financial oversight of public enterprises; and pursuing civil service reforms aiming to generate savings on the public wage bill while increasing the efficiency of public spending.  33. The conditions for a successful transition to greater exchange rate flexibility in 2017 are in place. Such flexibility will increase the shock absorption capacity of the economy, particularly given current constraints on fiscal space, and help preserve competitiveness. Staff is of the view that Morocco’s current position of strength offers a unique window of opportunity for such a transition. Staff supports the authorities’ preference for a gradual approach to dis-anchor the dirham from the current currency basket and to allow for monetary policy decisions to be increasingly based on inflation forecasts.  34. Ongoing advances in financial oversight will further enhance the financial system’s resilience including in the context of the cross border expansion of Moroccan banks and the forthcoming introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility. Increased supervisory resources, the shift toward more proactive, risk-based and forward looking supervision, and the authorities’ continued efforts to tighten provisioning requirements and to strengthen the macro-prudential policy framework, in line with 2015 FSAP recommendations, are welcome.   35. Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard  12-month cycle.        </page>

Credit growth has slowed since the end of the 2006-8 credit (boom and bust) cycle. Economic conditions were affected by the international financial crisis and ensuing macroeconomic uncertainties, while the credit downturn was driven by the legacy of a credit boom and overhang mainly in the real estate sector, like in many countries. Credit and business cycles have been aligned, but fluctuations in credit have been much larger than those of GDP suggesting that demand and supply factors have played a role (mostly related with increasing risks). On the demand side, corporate sector deleveraging, particularly in the real estate sector, could have reduced firms’ willingness to borrow. On the supply side, increasing NPLs and provisioning requirements may have led banks to reallocate credit away from most affected sectors.  Both credit demand and supply diminished rapidly after the 2008 financial crisis. The results of the estimations of a generalized method of moments with separate sets of exogenous variables indicate that both have been significant drivers of credit (with expected signs). The supply curve is estimated from the loan-deposit spread and NPLs, and the demand curve from GDP and real estate prices. In particular, the estimations show that banks supply more loans when systemic liquidity increases and demand increases with lower interest rates and higher real estate prices. Empirical evidence suggests that credit demand has been affected by slow growth in real estate prices in the post-financial crisis period, while supply has been affected by lower profitability for banks via interest rates and also a moderate rise in NPLs. More recently, since 2013, the supply curve has remained low and predicted demand has been somewhat higher, but supply cannot be identified as a major constraint for credit growth.  Going forward, credit is expected to grow around 5 percent annually over the medium term. Based on projected inflation and GDP growth, credit growth should be between 2.5 and 7 percent. A cross-country comparison of credit growth for emerging market countries with similar macro-indicators shows this projection is around the median expectation of 4.5 percent. Appropriate policies to boost credit activity, such as continuing with an accommodative monetary policy, government guarantee programs for boosting credit supply to SMEs, unlocking payment delays to revert liquidity constraints, and restructuring corporate debt that are negatively affecting bank balance sheets could play an important role to support this development.      -10-505101520199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016eDeviation from Trend in Credit-to-GDP Growth(Annual percent change, actual minus trend)GapHP TrendActual credit to GDP growthCredit boomSource: IMF WEO.

Morocco: Advancing Tax Reforms Morocco has undertaken a number of reforms to implement the consensus from the National Conference on Taxation in 2013. Key measures implemented since then include: the introduction of corporate tax brackets in the 2016 budget (departing from a unique 30 percent corporate income tax rate), the introduction of VAT deductions in some agro-industrial inputs, and improvements to the VAT refund system. The core VAT regime remains unchanged with a regular rate of 20 percent, and several reduced rates. Revisions were also introduced on excise tax rates, and the social contribution for the public sector increased on September 2016 with the implementation of the new pension law. Measures to better enforce tax payments by self-employed and liberal professions have also been put in place, and the government has taken actions to simplify various administrative procedures related to compliance and settlement of tax disputes.   Cross country experience suggests that successful tax reforms generally require a comprehensive approach. While average VAT statutory tax rates are very close among developing and advanced economies (14.7 percent versus 16.2 percent), income tax rates can vary significantly, but they have declined in the past ten years, and some convergence of corporate tax rates has been observed. There is a large variation in the contribution of different taxes to government revenues, and cross country experience also shows that multiple VAT rates could introduce economic distortions, complicate administration, and cause revenue loss.1 In the absence of comprehensive strategy, the risk is that isolated reforms of specific taxes may either introduce inconsistencies or distortions, or be perceived as unfair, and in the end counter-productive from the perspective of improving the quality, efficiency and acceptance of the tax system. While achievements have been made, there is a need for greater clarity and communication on the overall reform strategy. There is agreement that the priority is to broaden the tax base and make the system more efficient and equitable (including in light of widespread exemptions and tax evasion). However, faster implementation of the agreed consensus reached in 2013 requires a more strategic and pedagogic approach, including the coordination, sequence, and timeframe of reforms, which could yield about  1.5–2 percent of additional public revenues over the medium term. These could include:   Short term measures to boost VAT revenues based on recommendations from previous TA, specifically the application of 7 percent rate to some exempted products, including inputs to agriculture, and a gradual convergence to a dual VAT rate system;  Consolidation of the corporate tax reform, including to prevent tax avoidance from recently introduced corporate tax brackets, which are expected to yield an additional 0.7 percent of GDP of corporate tax revenues in 2017. At some point, a full assessment of the benefits and risks from implementing this tiered system, which is atypical from a cross country perspective, would help guide about future corporate tax reforms;    Accelerated reduction of exemptions for large agricultural firms, and better enforcement of tax payments by the self-employed and liberal professions. _______________ 1 On average, OECD countries collected 33.7 percent of their tax revenues through taxes on income (personal and corporate) and profits, fast-growing consumption taxes generate 20 percent of total tax revenue.

Morocco: Fiscal Decentralization The process of regionalization in Morocco has been revitalized with the adoption of the 2011 constitution. It intends to promote sustainable development, modernize state’s structures, and strengthen the participation of citizens to economic development. Significant economic, social, cultural, and environmental competencies are gradually transferred to regions and local communities.  Decentralization is now also leading to an increased sharing of public resources between the central government and local entities. The organic budget law for the regions, adopted in June 2015, defines the contours of this process and transposes the principles of the OBL at the local level, including by modernizing the institutional framework and reinforcing governance at the local level.  On the revenue side, an increased share of revenues from personal income tax, corporate tax, housing tax, VAT, and various licenses and fees are assigned to regions. For instance, the 2016 budget increased the share of income tax revenues allocated to regions from 1 to 2 percent, and the authorities plan to increase this share gradually in the years ahead up to 5 percent by 2020. To ensure that all regions meet their assigned expenditure responsibilities, additional transfers from the central government are also possible.  International experience shows that fiscal decentralization entails significant risks that Morocco will need to manage. Successful fiscal decentralizations requires clear revenue and spending responsibilities, sound public financial management, adequate revenue sharing arrangements, mechanisms to limit borrowing (including based on market discipline), and administrative controls.1 Morocco’s regional system is still characterized by significant fragmentation and administrative structures and the devolution of certain responsibilities to the local level may be too partial and, combined with limited implementation capacity, may lead to inconsistent development strategies (e.g., with regions deciding to open schools but without control on infrastructures or teacher hiring). Furthermore, own resources of regions (less than 10 percent of central government resources) may be insufficient and render the system increasingly dependent on complex tax revenue sharing mechanisms, equalization of grants, central government subsidies, and potentially excessive borrowing, with little incentive to mobilize revenues locally.2  The authorities are putting in place key elements of a strategy for fiscal decentralization, including safeguards at the central and local levels. Building on the framework provided by the organic budget law for the regions, these elements provide greater clarity on the sequence of reforms and public resources transfers, and on mechanisms to ensure sound public financial management at local and regional levels. They include:   Strengthened operational structure for regions, including for project management, and under high-level administrative oversight;  Reinforced regional legal, budgetary, and financial frameworks, including controls and checks and balances that replicate those in place for central government (e.g., as regards public procurement, performance requirements, and strict limits on indebtedness);   Pre-approved regional development plans, established through broad consultation, and aiming to align the amounts of dedicated public resources with the quality of expected public services;   An ongoing reflection on how to streamline and harmonize tax regimes at the local levels (regions, municipalities).  —————————— 1 See “Macro Policy Lessons for a Sound Design of Fiscal Decentralization”, IMF 2009. 2 See « Rapport du CESE sur les Exigences de la Régionalisation et Défis de l’Intégration des Politiques Sectorielles », mars 2016.      </page>

Unit Labor Costs and External Competitiveness Low relative unit labor costs (ULCs) are an important source of competitive advantage for Morocco. Sectors with high relative ULCs, notably the textile and leather sector, have lost global market share, compared to emerging sectors, such as mechanical and metallurgic manufacturing, chemicals, and electronics, which have much lower relative ULCs. The gap between ULCs in some emerging sectors relative to competitors has somewhat narrowed more recently, despite gains in labor productivity (electronics, chemicals). Low relative ULCs should translate to a depreciation in the ULC-based real effective exchange rate (REER), a measure of external competitiveness; however, the extent of this depreciation has been limited by nominal exchange rate movements vis-à-vis competitors.

Note: Competitors include China, India, Poland, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey. Morocco’s exports remain sensitive to the real effective exchange rate (REER). Regression analysis suggests that a 1pp depreciation in the real exchange rate leads to a 0.2-0.4 pp increase in merchandise exports (see Selected Issues Paper). This elasticity has weakened slightly since the global financial crisis. Looking ahead, as exports move up global value chains, this elasticity is likely to weaken to some extent;1 Morocco’s exports are currently only moderately integrated in global value chains. Continued productivity growth and greater exchange rate flexibility will be key in maintaining external competitiveness. Whereas high relative nominal wages in competitor countries may give Morocco a competitive advantage at the current juncture, in the long run, productivity growth matching or exceeding nominal wage growth will be central to maintaining low ULCs. At the same time, greater exchange rate flexibility would allow REERs to adjust in response to nominal shocks, playing an important role in preserving competitiveness. —————————— 1 IMF 2015, “Global Value Chains and the Exchange Rate Elasticity of Exports.”   </page>

Employment Trends in Morocco Unemployment has hovered about 10 percent and labor force participation is low, especially among women. Unemployment is largely structural as 65 percent of unemployed have been without a job for at least one year. It is much higher than the national rate for first-time job seekers, educated, urban, and young. 27.9 percent of the youth is neither employed nor in education or training (NEET). Female labor participation is very low at 24.8 percent and declining.  Job creation has been weak in the past five years. Morocco has only created 55,000 jobs per year over the last five years, which is below the number of market entrants. Job creation is happening only in the construction and service sectors. Indeed, it has been negative in agriculture and in low value-added industries such as textiles, which employ a large share of the manufacturing workforce (higher value-added sectors only represent a small share of manufacturing employment). Finally, while unpaid work has declined to 22.5 percent in 2014 (against 33.9 percent in 2000), jobs are still precarious as only 20.5 percent of workers receive medical coverage and only 12 percent of employed youth had a formal job contract in 2015.  Skill mismatches, high labor costs and rigid regulations remain important constraints on job creation and formalization, especially for women and youth. Score of Moroccan students at international tests are low, dropout rates are high, and 72 percent of students leave the education system without qualification. Literacy rates in rural areas are particularly low, especially among women. The majority of Moroccan students follow studies in social sciences at the expense of technical careers, which leads to skills mismatches. Labor market regulations are inflexible for hiring and layoffs. Lastly, compared to neighboring countries, Morocco has one of the highest ratio of minimum to average wages,1  which has an adverse impact on employment and job formalization for women and youth.2  Labor Costs, Value-Added, and Employment in Manufacturing Sub-Sectors  Sources: Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment, and the Digital Economy; and IMF staff estimates.

High/ Medium  Medium Term High. Weak external demand for Morocco’s exports, particularly from the euro area, could weaken growth and the external position.  Diversify export composition and markets, implement structural reforms to boost competitiveness. Greater exchange rate flexibility can help absorb external shocks. Significant slowdown in other large EMs/frontier economies. Medium Short Term Low. Whereas direct links to large EMs are limited, low growth in EMs could spill back to Morocco’s advanced economy trading partners. Low growth in frontier markets where Moroccan banks are present could pose a risk, for instance through elevated NPLs. Rise in populism and nationalism in large economies—especially those with near-term elections—could slow down or even reverse policy coordination and collaboration; international trade liberalization; financial, and labor flows; and lead to unsustainable policies, weighing on global growth and exacerbating financial market volatility. High Medium to Short Term High. An increase in protectionism could impact FDI in emerging sectors, impacting exports; reduced activity could lower growth. Heightened risk of fragmentation/security dislocation in parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. High Short Term High. Negative sentiment could reduce Morocco’s tourism receipts, and impair investor confidence, reducing FDI inflows. Disruptions in oil supply could increase oil prices, raising oil import costs. Tighter, more volatile global financial conditions, including a sharp rise in risk premia with a flight to safety. Medium Short Term Low. External debt is only about 30 percent of GDP, with long maturities, and foreign portfolio investments are moderate. The effect of surges in the US dollar on the dirham could be countered with the expected decline in the Euro. Foreign exchange exposures in the corporate and banking sectors are limited.

The relative likelihood is staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Morocco: Implementation of Past Fund Advice Policy implementation has been broadly in line with past Fund advice, but there is a need to speed up the implementation of key structural reforms. 1. Fiscal policy. The authorities continued fiscal consolidation, met the 2015 fiscal deficit target (4.5 percent of GDP), and remain committed to reducing public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020. Most of the new organic budget law provisions entered into force in January 2016, and the authorities plan to gradually implement the remaining provisions (including triennial budget and programming, making ceiling on wage appropriations binding, limiting the carryover of investment appropriations) by 2020. The parliament approved in July 2016 the parametric reform of the main public pension plan, which has started to be implemented. The authorities plan to gradually reduce certain remaining food subsidies (for wheat and sugar). Tax reforms continued with the removal of some exemptions and the introduction of corporate tax brackets, and the authorities prefer to assess the impact of these latest changes before revisiting them.  2. Monetary policy. Inflation remains low and inflation expectations are well-anchored. BAM reduced its main policy interest rate to 2.25 percent in March 2016. The authorities have decided to introduce greater exchange rate flexibility and inflation targeting starting in 2017.  3. Financial policies. Solid progress has been made in upgrading the financial policy framework, including implementing Basel III and FSAP recommendations. Most regulations to implement the new banking law have been introduced, with the exception of the crisis management and bank resolution frameworks. The authorities plan to submit the new central bank law for parliament approval in 2017.  4. Structural reforms. Morocco has made continued progress in the Doing Business ranking and in improving access to finance, but much remains to be done on the structural front, including to improve the business environment, competition and governance. Reforms are also needed to strengthen further the functioning of the job market and the quality of education outcomes and vocational training.</page>
<page id="42" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37 Annex II. External Sector Assessment Morocco’s external position is assessed as broadly consistent with fundamentals and desired policies. It has strengthened markedly since 2012, as narrowing current account deficits (due mainly to positive terms of trade movements) together with continued fiscal reform implementation reduced imbalances and strengthened reserves. Looking ahead, continued policy action to resolve remaining fiscal imbalances, increased exchange rate flexibility, and structural reform to improve the business climate and boost competitiveness would further bolster buffers and support the economy’s resilience.  Current account and exchange rate 1. The trade deficit has improved markedly due to favorable oil prices and growth in emerging export sectors. Morocco’s current account has been characterized by large trade deficits, a tourism-driven surplus in services, and strong remittances. The trade deficit in turn is highly sensitive to external demand, particularly from the Eurozone (2/3 of export market), and the price of oil, of which Morocco is one of the largest net importers. Since 2012, the sharp decline in oil prices has helped shrink the share of oil imports from 28 percent in 2012 to 18 percent in 2015. At the same time, the composition of exports has shifted toward higher value-added sectors, with automobile exports overtaking the traditional export engines, phosphate and textiles, in 2015. Tourism receipts, at about 6½ percent–7 percent of GDP, have remained robust despite low euro area growth, as markets have become more diversified. In the medium term, further growth in emerging export sectors, a diversification of markets, and structural reform implementation should support a slight narrowing of the trade deficit and improvement in the current account. 2. The REER has been on an appreciating trend since mid-2012. The Moroccan dirham, which is pegged to the euro (60 percent of the basket) and US dollar (40 percent), depreciated since mid-2009, by nearly 5½ percent by late 2012. More recently, however, the REER has appreciated, driven primarily by inflation differentials with euro area trading partners. As of November 2016, the pace of appreciation had picked up at 3.7 percent y-o-y due to the strengthening of the US dollar and higher domestic food prices due to the year’s drought.

Morocco’s external position is broadly consistent with that implied by fundamentals and desired policies. Based on the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology, the current account (CA) method suggests a current account gap of -0.9 percent of GDP, down from 1.7 percent in April 2016, which corresponds to an over-valuation of the REER of 3.1 percent. This gap consists of a policy gap of 0.9 percent of GDP, comprising mainly a fiscal policy gap of  -0.5 percent of GDP, a health spending gap of -0.3 percent of GDP, a credit gap of 0.3 percent of GDP, and a reserves gap of 0.6 percent of GDP; there is a sizeable residual of -1.9 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, planned fiscal consolidation, a recovery in credit growth, and the move to exchange rate flexibility should help close the current account gap. The REER method suggests an under-valuation of 6.4 percent; however, the underlying series on the home bias variable is limited for Morocco, which affects the robustness of the estimate. Capital and financial accounts 4. FDI has been an integral part of the current account financing mix. At about 2.5 percent of GDP, FDI has been directed mainly toward the emerging industrial sectors (30 percent of all FDI in  2013–15) and real estate (25 percent). In the medium term, FDI is expected to further increase, due especially to expected investments in the aeronautics, chemicals, and automobile sectors. In terms of other financing, both the government and corporates have recently been able to issue bonds in international markets at favorable rates supported by an accommodative global financing environment. External debt is contained at about 30 percent of GDP and its structure poses limited risks at present (see Figure 6, External Debt Sustainability Assessment).  Reserves  5. Morocco’s reserves are assessed as adequate based on a range of metrics. Reserve coverage has improved significantly as current account deficits have narrowed, currently amounting to a comfortable seven months of imports.

External balance sheet  6. Declining current account deficits have lifted Morocco’s net international investment position (NIIP). The NIIP position weakened from -51 percent of GDP in 2011 to about -64 percent of GDP in 2013 (due mainly to increased portfolio and other investments); since then, the NIIP has strengthened to 62½ percent of GDP on the back of the strengthening reserves position (which has offset the continued increase in FDI). Looking ahead, Morocco’s NIIP position should strengthen over the medium term to about -55 percent of GDP, as trade deficits narrow notwithstanding FDI growth.  7. On balance, the dirham is broadly aligned with fundamentals. The EBA’s external sustainability approach suggests that the current account is stronger than the level required to stabilize the IIP, suggesting an REER undervaluation of 9.7 (from 11.7 percent in April 2016). A current account deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP, weaker than projected in the baseline, would stabilize the IIP at its 2015 level of -61.3 percent of GDP (Scenario 1 below). To maintain the IIP at its ten-year average of about -55 percent of GDP (Scenario 2), a CA deficit of 3.8 percent is required; to reach this level in ten years, the CA deficit would need to strengthen to 3.4 percent of GDP (Scenario 3). Each of these scenarios implies varying degrees of real undervaluation. However, these estimates remain sensitive to the choice of base year and IIP targets.

Morocco’s external competitiveness has improved since 2000 despite a recent appreciation of the nominal ER. The unit labor cost (ULC)-based REER has been on a depreciating trend since 2000 due to relatively low unit labor costs, suggesting gains in Morocco’s external competitiveness, but recent movements in nominal exchange rates relative to competitors have led the ULC-based REER to appreciate (Selected Issues Paper). Although its unit labor costs are lower than its main trading partners in the Eurozone and most competitors, structural measures to increase labor productivity and improve labor market efficiency would help preserve external competitiveness outside of movements in the nominal exchange rate. Currently, Morocco ranks 70 out of 138 countries in the 2016-2017 World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, with low scores in higher education and training, innovation, and labor market efficiency. On the 2017 World Bank Ease of Doing Business Indicators, Morocco now ranks 68th (up from 75th in the 2016 rankings).   </page>

In addition to the adverse external environment, this reflects declining productivity, human capital and employment levels compared to emerging market peers. Our analyses show that growth prospects could improve significantly if key constraints were addressed, especially as regards: governance and the business environment, human capital, the labor market and in particular female labor force participation.  1. Morocco’s growth performance has been uneven over the last decades (Figure 1).  In the 2000s, the economy grew rapidly at an average of 5.1 percent, and output was less volatile, thanks to strong domestic demand, favorable external conditions and the implementation of adequate macroeconomic and structural reforms. Since 2011, Morocco’s economy has slowed (partly reflecting less favorable external conditions) reverting back to a lower average growth rate of 3.9 percent. PPP-adjusted GDP per capita growth has been lower relative to the average emerging market countries. 2. Productivity is low relative to other emerging market peers and will be key to improve potential growth for Morocco. TFP estimates show that Morocco has improved, but remains below many of its peers (Figure 2). A closer look at episodes of growth take-off in emerging markets shows that those episodes are generally associated with a strong pick-up in productivity growth (Dabla-Norris et al., 2013).  3. The contribution of employment to growth has declined since 2008, despite an increase in the working-age share of the population (Figure 3). Morocco currently lags behind benchmark countries on labor force and employment growth (Figure 4). This deterioration reflects lower employment rates than in the past and further declines in the labor force participation rate.   4. Human capital gaps are large relative to emerging market peers. While average years of schooling have been rising, Morocco displays a sizeable Source: Penn World Tables (9.1) -10-5051015198019821984198619881990199219941996199820002002200420062008201020122014Figure 1: Morocco: GDP Growth, 1980-2015GDP Growth (annual percent change)Source:IMF WEO.0.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.911.119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014Figure 2: TFP Levels (Spain=1)EMEURLACASIATunisiaMoroccoSources: Penn World Tables (9.1).Figure 3: Contribution of Factors to GDP Growth-3-2-1012345671992-20002001-72008-152016-21eMENAPOITFPhcEKGDP-3-2-1012345671992-20002001-72008-112012-152016e2017-21pMoroccoSources: Penn World Tables; WEO; and IMF staff estimates.

Using data by Barro and Lee (2013) on the number of schooling years and following (Psacharopoulos, 1994) methodology, we derive Morocco’s human capital stock and show that it is significantly lower than in other benchmark countries (Figure 4).

Continued economic diversification also offers opportunities for increased productivity and faster economic growth. In 2008, the government launched a diversification strategy, “Plan Emergence,” to widen the production and export bases. Consequently, the economy benefited from significant structural changes in recent years, as newly developed industries (automobile, aeronautics, and electronics) have represented an increasing share of exports. The economy’s resilience to shocks has also improved, with the impact of climatic shocks to the aggregate output relatively dampened, as is presently the case. Yet, economic diversification in Morocco is lower than the MENA oil importers average, and Morocco’s economy is less complex than many emerging market economies. Going forward, policies and strategies to stimulate new tradable sectors will involve fostering horizontal and vertical diversification, and further integrating into global value chains. 6. Our baseline scenario assumes that potential growth would increase by about 1 percentage point in 2021 compared to 2016. It assumes that the authorities’ ongoing structural reform agenda to improve the business environment and access to finance, and sectoral plans to diversify and increase the resilience of the economy, will lead to a pick-up in productivity and higher capital accumulation. This should increase potential output by 1 percentage point over the medium-term. 7. Structural reforms could boost potential growth by more than 2 percentage points.

Increasing Morocco’s growth potential would allow the country to catch up faster with higher income countries. Morocco’s living standards have consistently increased and a high degree of macroeconomic stability has been attained. However, income levels are still substantially below those in developed or high-income economies. Indeed, while Morocco grew rapidly before the global financial crisis and in particular during the years 2001–07, economic growth slowed, and the speed of income convergence has consequently been modest (Figure 6). Our analysis shows that fully implementing the structural reforms mentioned above would allow a much rapid convergence with high-income countries.1                                                       1 The convergence half-life is the log of 2 divided by the difference in average per capita income growth between Morocco and OECD counties over the 2016-21 period.

<page id="49" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO 44 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Morocco’s public debt remains sustainable. While the gross debt-to-GDP ratio declined between 2000 and 2010, external shocks and domestic factors have caused the ratio to rise again since then. Nevertheless, at about 64.1 percent of GDP at the end of 2015, public debt remains sustainable, and the DSA shows it to be resilient to various shocks. Vulnerabilities linked to the level and profile of the debt appear to be moderate for the most part. Gross financing needs (mainly linked to the rollover of existing debt) have exceeded the benchmark of 15 percent of GDP in 2014, but are now declining, further mitigating rollover risks. 1. This DSA updates the analysis conducted at the request for an arrangement under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line. The overall analysis is largely unchanged, and public debt remains sustainable. A slight downward revision to the real output growth projections for 2016–21 has not affected the debt to GDP ratio significantly given that the authorities maintain their deficit target for 2016-17 unchanged (3.5 percent and 3 percent of GDP respectively), plan to finance a portion of those deficits through deposits and privatization proceeds (for 2016), and intend to put the debt to GDP ratio on a downward path over the medium term.  2. After declining in the previous decade, Morocco’s public debt to GDP ratio started rising in 2010 following a deterioration in its macroeconomic performance. Rising international commodity prices contributed to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, mainly through higher food and fuel subsidies, and public debt rose from 48 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 64.1 percent in 2015. About half of this increase occurred in 2012, when the economy was most affected by the crisis in Europe (Morocco’s main trade partner) and higher oil prices, and the authorities encountered difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit. The increase in public debt to GDP over the past three years has been mostly driven by the levels of the primary deficit and higher-than-expected real interest rate/growth differential. However, the authorities’ ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to help bring the debt ratio down to 60 percent of GDP by 2020. 3. Public debt is generally resilient to shocks, but there are residual risks linked to financing needs and, to a lesser extent, to shocks to growth and the primary balance (heat map). Baseline projections are realistic when compared to a group of market access countries. Morocco’s projected fiscal consolidation efforts, aimed at lowering the overall deficit to about 2.4 percent of GDP in the medium term, do not appear exceptional relative to the distribution of other country cases. The debt level remains well below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets when various shocks are assumed, except in cases of shocks to real GDP growth or to the primary balance where it slightly approaches the benchmark. Vulnerabilities linked to the profile of debt are mostly moderate and short-term debt still represents a very small part of the total debt (about 5 percent). Relevant indicators exceed the lower early-warning benchmarks but not the upper risk assessment benchmarks (chart). Gross financing needs, which exceeded the benchmark of 15 percent in 2014, declined under that benchmark in 2015, and are expected to continue declining over the medium term due to a lengthening of average maturities through </page>
<page id="50" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 45 improved debt management. Although gross financing needs could increase under the shock scenario, the nature of the investment base (mostly local investors, many of whom are long-term investors) mitigates the associated risks. Nonetheless, these risks highlight the importance of continuing on the path of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt-financed deficits, and of carefully managing the maturity profile of public debt. External Debt Sustainability  4. Risks to external debt sustainability are contained. Morocco’s external debt to GDP is expected to decline slightly to 32.4 percent of GDP in 2016, and decline to 27.2 percent of GDP in the medium term due mainly to steady GDP growth, as well as strong FDI inflows reducing the need for external borrowing. The structure of external debt entails limited vulnerabilities: 75 percent is owed to official bilateral and multilateral creditors with long maturities, and about 75 percent carries fixed-rate terms. The external debt position remains resilient to a range of shocks (Figure 6); in the event of a large depreciation, external debt is projected to increase from 27 to 40 percent of GDP by 2021.   </page>

<page id="59" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">MOROCCO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND   3 Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 60 percent and 40 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international exchange markets. As of December 15, 2016, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 13.6. Article IV Consultation Morocco is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 27, 2016. The discussions for the 2016 consultation were held in Rabat and Casablanca during November 16–December 1, 2016.

The findings were discussed with the authorities during the October/November 2015 Article IV mission and discussed by the Board on December 14, 2015.   Safeguard assessment An update of the 2013 safeguards assessment of the BAM, completed in January 2015, found that the safeguards framework at the BAM remains relatively strong. The Board continues to be engaged and governance arrangements are supported by strong internal audit and risk management functions. A new law on BAM statutes that would lead to sustained good governance practices and autonomy is expected to be approved in 2017. Regarding staff’s recommendation to implement IFRS, the BAM carried out a feasibility study with the assistance of an audit firm and decided to maintain the current accounting standards. Instead financial statement disclosures were improved to enhance transparency.  Resident Representative: None  </page>

<page id="65" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">   Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco January 23, 2017   My Moroccan authorities wish to express their gratitude to staff for fruitful discussions during these consultations and a balanced report as well as for the interesting Selected Issues paper. They broadly share staff analysis and conclusions.   Morocco continues to adjust to the generally weak and uncertain external environment by further strengthening its macroeconomic fundamentals and resilience and rebuilding buffers, while continuing to lay the foundations for stronger and more inclusive growth. In 2016, growth is estimated to have slowed to 1½–2 percent, from 4½ percent in 2015, mainly due to a poor cereal crop after the all-time record achieved the previous year, leading to a decline of agriculture output by about 10 percent, while non-agriculture growth remained positive at  3–3½ percent. Inflation remained well under control, at about 1½ percent. Unemployment declined slightly but remained high, in particular for the young and women. Early signs of a recovery in late 2016 bode well for non-agricultural GDP growth in 2017, which is expected, along with a projected recovery in agriculture, based on improved weather conditions from last year, to lead to total GDP growth of 4½–5 percent this year.  The impact of the decline in cereals production in 2016 on overall GDP growth was much more muted than in the past, when such large though rare declines brought overall GDP growth well into negative territory. This reduction in GDP growth volatility attests to the success of agriculture diversification and productivity-enhancing reforms. It also reflects the dynamism of new, high value-added and export-oriented sectors in response to well-structured industrial policies and improved business climate.   The current account deficit edged up slightly to about 3 percent of GDP. Exports of automobiles, electronics, and aeronautics continued to be strong. However, lower prices affected exports of phosphates and derivatives. Moreover, imports of machinery, food and other consumer goods increased markedly, more than offsetting lower fuel import prices. As a result of continuing strong FDI inflows and higher other private capital inflows, the external reserve position strengthened further to reach close to 7 months of imports, or about 130 percent of the Fund adjusted-ARA metric (100 percent of the standard metric).   Implementation of the medium-term fiscal consolidation plan has helped significantly reduce the deficit and stabilize public debt. The fiscal deficit target of 3½ percent of GDP in 2016, down from 7.3 percent in 2012, is within reach, with lower grants expected to be offset mainly through stronger tax revenue and savings on current spending, including </page>

In the context of a larger than projected slowdown in growth and in the run up to last October elections, this is no small achievement that attests to the authorities’ strong commitment to sound fiscal policy.  In view of the relatively moderate growth along with low and stable inflation and comfortable reserves, the current policy mix of further fiscal consolidation along with monetary policy accommodation is appropriate. The draft 2017 Budget presented to parliament in early October aims at further reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP as planned, including through continued implementation of the recommendations of the 2013 national tax conference and tight control of current spending. Discussion of this draft budget has not started since negotiations for a new government have not yet been completed. It is very unlikely that the final Budget would deviate from the current consolidation path, in view of the authorities’ well-established track record of fiscal prudence, and since preserving fiscal balances has been enshrined in the new constitution as a joint responsibility of the government and parliament.   Public debt is sustainable and resilient to shocks, with favorable maturity, interest rate and currency structure. It has stabilized as a ratio to GDP at 64 percent since 2015 and should start declining this year to achieve the authorities’ objective of 60 percent by 2020. Active debt management operations within strengthened debt management strategy have contributed to improving the structure of the debt and reducing costs and risks.  Significant progress has been made in implementation of the ambitious structural fiscal reform agenda aimed at further strengthening institutions and the policy framework. Implementation of the 2015 Organic Budget Law (OBL) is proceeding according to schedule. The new OBL and the landmark reform subsidy, along with the entry into effect of the bold parametric pension reform, which has reduced the actuarial deficit of the public pension fund by close to 60 percent, have significantly reduced budget vulnerabilities and risks. While agreement on the pension reform took longer than expected, its enactment and start of implementation immediately before the general elections attest to the government strong commitment to the reform. Implementation of the tax reform is advancing, with the objective of simplifying the system and enhancing its equity, while making it more business-friendly. Progress is being made on fiscal decentralization under the ambitious Advanced Regionalization program, with gradual roll-over of financial and human resources to allow territorial entities to support growth at the local level and enhance efficiency within sound budget management practices.   With inflation well under control, continued moderate credit growth, along with comfortable reserves and prudent fiscal policy, monetary policy will continue to aim at supporting the recovery by promoting adequate financing of the economy, including SMEs, while maintaining its core focus on keeping inflation low. BAM reduced the policy rate by 25 bp in March 2016, the third such reduction since September 2014. The </page>
<page id="67" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">3  current accommodative monetary policy has led to a significant decline in lending rates by a total of 99 bp over the last 2 years, reflecting effective monetary transmission, which has helped reinvigorate credit.  The financial system is well-capitalized, with adequate liquidity and profitability. While NPLs have increased somewhat, they are confined mainly in a few sectors, including those affected by the global economic slowdown, and are well provisioned. The authorities continue to closely monitor credit concentration risks, which have declined recently and where limits set by the regulator are tighter that the standard practice and effectively enforced. They have strengthened supervisory resources, including for oversight of Moroccan banks’ subsidiaries in Africa, and have maintained close cooperation with host countries to identify and mitigate potential risks. They continue to strengthen financial sector regulation and their pro-active and risk-based supervision, including in implementing FSAP recommendations.   Preparation for gradually moving to a flexible exchange rate regime has been virtually completed, with extensive technical support from MCM and RES departments, for which the authorities are grateful. A roadmap of the reform has been prepared and discussed with staff. The authorities have requested Fund TA to help assess preparedness of the banking sector to manage currency risks and to adapt public debt management to the new exchange rate regime. They are finalizing their communication strategy, and are confident that they will be in a position to announce the policy change and start implementation in the second half of this year. Later in the transition, when the fluctuation band will be large enough, BAM will abandon the nominal exchange rate as an anchor and shift to an inflation targeting regime.  To improve the business climate, raise productivity and growth potential, and accelerate job creation, the authorities continue to strengthen the financial sector, including by further deepening markets, easing access to credit, and enhancing financial inclusion. They are also strengthening support to SMEs to enhance their contribution to growth and reduce informality. Important efforts are also being made in streamlining regulations and upgrading infrastructure, with positive effects on productivity and access to services. As a result of these reforms, Morocco gained 7 notches in the Doing Business ranking to 68 between 2016 and 2017, with significant advances in registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, and trading across borders. Implementation of the recently-adopted National Strategy for Employment and the Strategic Vision for Education will help boost productivity and alleviate constraints to employment, including by improving education and vocational training and enhancing effectiveness of labor market policies. The large renewable energy program, in particular in solar energy, is advancing as planned, and should help meet the authorities’ ambitious climate mitigation undertakings while reducing Morocco’s dependency on fuel imports.  </page>
<page id="68" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">4  The authorities are confident that their current policy and reforms will be continued and consolidated going forward. The reappointment of the current Head of Government to form a new coalition government provides further assurance in this regard in view of his strong commitment to sound policy implementation. The authorities look forward to continued close cooperation with the Fund.  </page>
