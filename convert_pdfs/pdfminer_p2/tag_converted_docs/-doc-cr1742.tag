The moderate impact of the large shocks since 2011 highlights the resilience of the economy and strong policy frameworks. From mid-2015, the recovery advanced with a marked pickup in activity, although underlying demand growth remained close to trend. Nevertheless, Australia has not been immune to some elements of the “new mediocre.” Wage and price pressures have been weak, underemployment has risen, and private business investment outside mining has been lackluster.  </P><P MCID="10">By some metrics, housing market conditions have cooled, in tandem with intensified prudential and regulatory steps, but risks related to house price and debt levels remain. In the continued low interest rate environment, house prices and household debt have risen further but house price growth has moderated. Intrinsic housing market risks are localized. Bank lending to household has slowed, especially in riskier loans, and banks have strengthened their balance sheets.  </P><P MCID="11">With inflation below the target range of 2-3 percent and a downshift in the path of inflation expectation in 2016, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its policy rate by another 50 basis points to 1.5 percent. Core inflation has since stabilized at around 1.6 percent. Wage growth has remained weak, with nominal unit labor costs running at less than 0.5 percent on average, and cost pressures have been virtually absent suggesting that some economic slack is still present. </P><P MCID="12">The federal government has recently aimed for substantial near-term fiscal consolidation but budget targets have not been met because of weaker nominal income. In the FY2016/17 budget, the government has projected a return to fiscal balance by FY2020/21. It has renewed its commitment to a federal government surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the business cycle as a medium-term fiscal anchor, which would imply a cumulative adjustment of up to 3.4 percent of </P><Artifact Attached="[/Bottom]" Subtype="/Footer" Type="/Pagination">                                                 </Artifact><P MCID="13">1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2016-17 (MYEFO) foresees a cumulative adjustment of the fiscal balance of 2.1 percent of GDP by end of FY2019/20, primarily related to stronger personal income tax collection due to bracket creep.  </P><P MCID="1">Recent structural reforms have focused on fostering innovation. The National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) includes measures to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in the high-tech sector, including through tax breaks. Legislation is being prepared for key components of the Harper Review, which has identified a number of reforms to boost competition and productivity in the services sectors, and to strengthen competition policy broadly. </P><P MCID="2">Executive Board Assessment2 </P><P MCID="3">Executive Directors noted that Australia’s robust economic growth and low unemployment during the current terms-of-trade adjustment reflect the resilience of the economy and strong policy frameworks. While the balance of risks to the growth outlook has improved, there remain significant risks and uncertainties, notably weaker-than-expected domestic consumption, housing-related vulnerabilities, the rise in protectionist policies in the global economy, and a significant slowdown in Australia’s main trading partners. Against this background, Directors stressed the importance of maintaining supportive macroeconomic policies, addressing macro-financial vulnerabilities, and boosting long-term potential growth.  </P><P MCID="4">Directors noted that continued demand support is needed to ensure a smooth transition to non-mining growth. They agreed that, with inflation below target, still elevated underemployment, and remaining economic slack, the monetary policy stance should remain accommodative. Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to ease monetary policy further if warranted, and encouraged steps to improve policy communication.  </P><P MCID="5">Directors supported the government’s plans to balance its budget over four years and make its expenditure composition more growth-friendly. Many Directors saw scope for using the available fiscal space to support aggregate demand and structural fiscal reforms, as well as increase infrastructure investment. Many other Directors viewed the authorities’ front-loaded consolidation path as appropriately prudent under the current circumstances. Directors welcomed the intention to take a flexible approach if large downside risks materialize, noting that contingency plans would also be helpful. While the current medium-term fiscal framework has served the economy well, Directors recommended that the authorities continue to consider options to strengthen it further.  </P><P MCID="6">Directors commended the progress in enhancing prudential and regulatory measures to mitigate risks associated with the housing market, and in improving AML/CFT safeguards in the real estate sector. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant and continue to enhance the resilience of the banking system to shocks with macro-financial implications, including by encouraging banks to strengthen their capital position.

Australia has enjoyed a robust economic performance despite the commodity price and mining investment bust. The moderate impact of the large shocks since 2011 reflects prompt monetary easing, a flexible exchange rate acting as a shock absorber, export orientation to the dynamic Asia region, flexible labor markets, relatively high population growth, and strong institutions. Nevertheless, Australia has also been confronted with symptoms of the “new mediocre” since the Global Financial Crisis, including a downshift in average GDP growth. And with declining interest rates, already high house prices and household debt ratios have started to rise again. Outlook and risks. After a slowdown due to one-off factors around mid- 2016, growth close to trend is expected to resume from 2017 onwards, with increasing contributions from so far lackluster private domestic demand. With a gradual return to full employment, inflation is expected to edge back up within its 2-3 percent target range. Macro-financial vulnerabilities are expected to stabilize as house prices align with broader price levels. A hard landing in China is a major external risk, while housing-related vulnerabilities remain the dominant domestic source of risk.  Policy recommendations. The policy priorities are to complete the transition to non-mining-based growth with adequate demand support amid mild symptoms of the “new mediocre”, contain macro-financial risks, and upgrade the longer-term growth potential.   Demand support. Under the baseline, the priority is to maintain monetary accommodation and to use Australia’s fiscal space for a gradual fiscal consolidation while raising infrastructure spending and supporting structural reforms. If a large downside shock were to materialize, fiscal stimulus may be needed to support aggregate demand, considering that monetary policy could rapidly become constrained by the effective lower bound on nominal policy rates.   Macro-financial policies. Policies should focus on further strengthening resilience to housing and other shocks with macro-financial implications—by maintaining robust bank capital positions, completing regulatory reform, and standing ready to tighten prudential regulation should house prices increases re-accelerate.   Raising productivity. Reforms should focus on fostering innovation, raising competition and productivity in the services sectors, and reforming the tax system.   January 17, 2017 </page>

Australia’s economic performance has been robust in comparison to other advanced economies despite the commodity price and mining investment bust. Growth has remained above 2 percent (annual rate) and increases in unemployment have been small. The moderate impact of the large shocks since 2011 reflects prompt monetary easing, a flexible exchange rate acting as a shock absorber, export orientation to the dynamic Asia region, relatively high labor force and population growth, and flexible labor markets. Another reason is the relatively small size of the commodity sector and continued strong mining export performance (Annex I: “Four Years After the Bust …”). In this setting, Australia’s long expansion without a recession has continued uninterrupted for 25 years. 2.      Still, Australia has been confronted with symptoms of the “new mediocre.” The economy has experienced a slowdown since the global financial crisis (GFC), with average GDP growth about 0.8 percent lower (annual rate), which is indicative of lower potential output growth. As elsewhere, the adjustment to the shocks has been drawn out, and growth has fallen short of expectations in 2014 and early 2015, partly from weaker-than-expected partner country growth and partly from domestic demand weakness. In particular, growth in non-mining business investment has been slow despite declines in real interest rates and real exchange rate depreciation. At the same time, underemployment and long-term unemployment have been higher, while nominal wage growth has been low and inflation has fallen below target.  3.      Housing-related and external macro-financial vulnerabilities are a concern. Real house prices and household debt ratios rose to high levels in tandem during the country’s economic boom of the 1990s and 2000s. While stabilizing after the global financial crisis, both house prices and household debt ratios have picked up again recently. The main concern is the large housing -2024GREITAPORFINSLOESPDNKEANTHJAPAUTFRABELCZEGERNORUKCHEUSASWECANSLKNZLAUSTWNKORISRAverage Annual Real GDP Growth(2009-15)-4.9Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook database.0.000.100.200.300.400.500.602000Q12003Q12006Q12009Q12012Q12015Q12000Q1=1,   log scaleReal GDPAustraliaUSAAustralia: counterfactualSources: HaverAnalytics and IMF staff calculations.1/ Counterfactual is based on pre-GFC average growth (2003-07).</page>

On the external side, Australia has had long-running current account deficits and a relatively large net external liability position. Much of the related risks focus on the funding of Australian banks because they rely heavily on international wholesale markets.      RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS A.   Developments over the Past Year 4.      Australia’s recovery advanced with a pickup in activity from mid-2015, but underlying demand growth remained closer to trend. Growth (at annual rates) increased to over 3 percent from mid-2015—above current potential output growth estimates of 2¾ percent—driven by higher government spending, LNG export capacity coming on stream, strong services export growth, and buoyant residential investment.1 That said, private business investment outside mining has remained more subdued than expected. And with the growth rebalancing toward non-mining activity, activity in states where such activity dominates has been buoyant, and disparities in economic performance between non-mining and mining states have widened. With hindsight, some of the growth pickup in early 2016 reflected one-off level increases in demand, particularly in government spending. Consequently, real GDP unexpectedly contracted by 2 percent annualized in 2016Q3 when these level effects wore off, with temporary, weather-related weakness in residential investment spending also contributing. The strength of underlying growth in aggregate demand, however, does not appear to have changed.  5.      Labor market conditions have improved although the fall in the unemployment rate likely overstates the improvement in labor markets. Employment picked up with overall activity, and                                                    1 Background work for the 2015 Article IV consultation suggests that annual potential output growth in Australia has declined from about 3¼ percent before the global financial crisis to about 2¾ percent in recent years.

<page id="10" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND unemployment has decreased from its recent peak. Still, the underemployment rate—defined as the share of employed persons in the labor force seeking to work more hours—has remained almost 2 percentage points above average (7 percent of the active labor force over the past 20 years). Some 80 percent of the jobs created over the past year or so have been part-time jobs.2 At the same time, the share of long-term unemployment has remained above average. As of mid-2016, IMF Staff estimates the output gap at 1.7 percent and the unemployment rate gap at 0.5 percent (about 1¼ percent at the peak).  6.      Both headline and core inflation have been below the inflation target range of 2-3 percent in 2016, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) responded promptly to an unexpected downshift in the inflation path. Initially, the disinflation that began in late 2014 had been driven by the declines in the prices of oil and other commodities. Over the past 12 months, however, the declines have been due to non-tradables inflation, with the RBA pointing to the temporary inflation impact from lower margins due to increased competition in the retail and other sectors. After a noticeable, unexpected decline of core inflation in the first quarter of 2016, and a downshift in the path of expected inflation, the RBA has lowered the policy rate by another 50 basis points to 1.5 percent in 2016 in May and August. Core inflation has since stabilized at around 1.6 percent. Wage growth has remained weak, with nominal unit labor costs running at less than 0.5 percent on average, and cost pressures have been virtually absent.  7.      The current account balance has remained moderately weaker than its fundamental level and the Australian dollar has continued to be moderately overvalued. The commodity-currency adjustment mechanism that has come into play after the mining investment bust has supported the rebalancing of growth toward net exports, with investment weakness also weighing on imports. A renewed widening of the current account deficit in 2015 reflected temporary factors, including weather related export declines and exceptional imports, and the balance has since                                                    2 See Annex III for a summary of the forthcoming selected issues paper by Mohammad, 2016, “Labor Market Adjustment to Shocks in Australia,” discussing labor market adjustment after the global financial crisis and after the commodity price bust and mining investment decline. 45678919951998200120042007201020132016Underemployment rateUnemployment rateUnemployment and Underemployment Rate(%)Source: Haver Analytics.66687072747619951998200120042007201020132016Share of Full-Time Jobs in Total Employment(%)Source: Haver Analytics.</page>

While currency depreciation in 2014-15 has reduced much of the overvaluation that had developed over the boom, the correction has stalled in recent months (Annex IV—External Sector Assessment). The latter has likely reflected the relative attractiveness of Australian assets, given their relatively high returns. Nonetheless, yields on longer-term Australian bonds have declined, and valuation effects from the resulting bond price increases, together with exchange rate appreciation, have contributed to a marked deterioration in the net external liability position over the past year, given the economy’s sizeable net short position in that asset class (Annex II). That said, the underlying risk profile has improved further, adding to improvements since the global financial crisis, as the share of longer-term external funding of Australian banks has increased over the past year or so, while that of short-term external funding has decreased.  8.      By some metrics, housing market conditions have cooled and credit growth to households has slowed, but risks related to house price and debt levels have not yet decreased.   Real house price gains have moderated. Indicators of current conditions such as sales volumes and the rate of turnover in the housing stock have moderated. The extent of cooling has varied considerably across capital cities. The strongest price increases continue to be recorded in Sydney and Melbourne, where underlying demand for housing remains strong. With house prices still rising ahead of income, standard valuation metrics suggest somewhat higher house price overvaluation relative to the assessment in 2015 Article IV consultation.  The flipside has been slowing growth in bank lending to households. APRA prudential guidance requiring tighter lending standards by banks, which was introduced in late 2014, has curtailed growth in riskier mortgage loans in particular and credit growth to household more broadly. At the same time, there has been some upward pressures on mortgage rates, as banks have increased capital ratios and prepared for a higher risk weight on mortgage lending. That said, household credit gaps have not yet reversed.   On the supply side, residential investment has risen to some 0.5 percent of GDP above its long-term average (the ratio remains comparatively low given population and labor force growth). An above-average number of new apartments is expected to come on stream in the next year or so, mostly in the downtown areas of Brisbane, Melbourne, and, to a lesser extent, Sydney. Concerns about temporary oversupply have thus risen. But leading indicators, such as approvals of new houses and other dwellings or new residential construction starts, have started to level off after brisk increases in 2014-15. In commercial real estate, property price valuations have increased but are still within the usual range of variation over the cycle (Box 1). </page>

Household sector leverage has been stable overall despite higher debt, and debt buffers have risen but not for all households. The household debt ratio rose to 186 percent of gross disposable income over the past year, but underlying vulnerabilities have not increased to the same extent. Mortgage buffers—balances in related offset accounts and redraw facilities, which are held for tax and precautionary reasons—have also risen, to some 18 percent of outstanding mortgage loans by mid-2016—the equivalent of around 2½ years of scheduled debt payments at current interest rates. And household leverage (liabilities as a percent of net worth) has been stable and low at around 25 percent.3 Yet there is considerable heterogeneity across households. With house values a rising multiple of income, first-time homebuyers and other new borrowers tend to have higher debt ratios and smaller buffers. Indeed, around 25 percent of all households in each income quintile had debt to income ratios above 3 in FY2013-14—the latest available year for  income and wealth data across households. These households may well be liquidity-constrained in an economic downturn.                                                      3 The household saving ratio has remained relatively high since it rebounded in 2007-08 and household net lending (saving minus gross fixed capital formation) has been positive since then, implying that households continue to acquire financial assets. A good part of household financial assets is held in so-called superannuation funds, the mandatory second pension pillar. 02040608010012020122013201420152016Loans approved≤LVR 60%Loans approved 60%&lt;LVR≤80%Loans approved 80%&lt;LVR≤90%Loans approved LVR&gt;90%New Residential Term Loan Approvals byLoan-to-Valuation Ratio (LVR)(In percent of total new residential loans)Source: APRA0510152025303540455020122013201420152016Low documentation loans approvedInterest-only loans approvedNew Residential Term Loans to Households Approved(In percent of total new residential loans)Source: APRA0.00.40.81.21.60.00.10.20.30.4123451234512345HH with debt 3 timesincome or higher(fraction)Median debt to asset ratioMedian debt toincome ratio (RHS)2003-20042013-2014Household Leverage by Income QuantileSource: ABS.</page>

Banks have further strengthened their balance sheets, responding to regulatory change and market pressure. The large Australian banks have raised the CET1 capital ratio from 8.6 of risk-weighted assets (RWA) in June 2014 to 10 percent at the end of 2015, partly through raising fresh capital, and the ratios are expected to have improved further in 2016. According to APRA studies, after adjusting for stricter requirements in capital and RWA calculations, these capital ratios have placed the banks at the low end of the top quartile internationally. Bank funding conditions have also improved, with foreign currency funding continuing to be fully hedged. Nonperforming loans (NPL) have remained largely unchanged.4  B.   Outlook 11.      The baseline outlook is for the resumption of growth close to trend, a gradual return of inflation into the target range, and a slow stabilization of macro-financial vulnerabilities.   Growth is expected to be close to trend, with increasing contributions from domestic demand growth as the adjustment to the commodity and mining shocks advances further. With the contraction in 2016Q3 largely due to one-off factors, growth is expected to resume in the last quarter of 2016. Residential investment growth is expected to rebound, given a strong pipeline of building approvals and housing starts. The contribution of private business investment to growth should turn positive, as the correction in mining investment should run its course and non-mining investment should start to pick up. In addition, states that have experienced rapid growth in activity are expected to ramp up infrastructure spending in 2017-18. Private consumption should strengthen with the recovery continuing and labor markets improving further. On the export side, the rate of growth is expected to slow somewhat, as the initial boost from new mining capacity and new sources of demand (e.g., tourism from Asia) should moderate.   The disinflation experienced in 2015-16 is expected to start reversing. With the rebound of oil prices in 2016, an important source of disinflation has already dissipated. Other sources are expected to weaken gradually. The output gap is projected to decline, and the inflation effects from downward pressure on producer price levels from increased competition in the retail sectors should wear off with no major new market entrants.                                                     4 The NPL ratio of loans to the agricultural sector from the banks’ New Zealand subsidiaries has increased modestly since the beginning of 2016, but it remains low, at around 1 percent. The overall exposure to the sector is small—some 1½ percent of banks’ consolidated assets. 681012141618202224APRA 2015 studyAPRA 2016 update4th quartile3rd quartile2nd quartile1st quartileCET1 Ratios of Major Banks(% of RWA)8.610.09.611.111.713.5AUS (headline)AUS (Basel QIS)AUS (comparison ratio)</page>
<page id="14" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  The macro-financial outlook is for a stabilization of housing-related vulnerabilities. The main driver is a realignment of house price inflation with broader measures of inflation and robust growth. Recent increases in residential investment should result in higher supply over the next two years, especially in market segments that have seen higher prices increases, and lower affordability should constrain demand. Credit gaps and debt ratios should thus stabilize or decline. On the external side, the accumulation of net external liabilities should slow in the absence of valuation effects. As banks prepare to meet net stable funding ratio requirements by 2018, related vulnerabilities should improve further. C.   Risks 12.      The balance of risks has improved but is still to the downside. The interaction of external and domestic downside risks must remain the main policy concern. The momentum of the recovery could be stronger, as recent terms-of-trade improvements could boost business confidence and commodity production if they are more persistent than expected. On the downside, growth could be slower, as consumption growth could remain lackluster with continued low wage growth and high incidence of part-time work, and profits could remain under pressure for longer with increased competition and relatively persistent slack. On the external side, there are risks to global trade from rising populism and nationalism in large economies and from tighter and more volatile global financial conditions. A major concern for macro-financial risk management is that external risks could hit both traditionally exposed sectors (commodity prices and exports) and new sources of growth (e.g., services exports), for example, a sharper growth slowdown in China (Annex V—Risk Assessment Matrix). If such external risks materialized, they could interact with or even trigger domestic risks, especially a sharp housing market correction, also given that annual approvals for all non-residents applying to purchase residential property have substantially increased to around 20 percent of overall turnover value, and they could lead to external funding pressure for banks.  D.   The Authorities’ Views on Outlook and Risks 13.      The authorities emphasized that the transition to non-mining-based growth after the boom was well advanced. They acknowledged that some elements of the “new mediocre” were present, including weak private business investment. But they saw these as a reflection of the drawn out adjustment of the economy to the decline in the terms of trade and the large fall in mining investment rather than a cause. While many of the new jobs were part-time ones, this partly reflected preferences in the labor force. The rise in underemployment as well as in long-term and youth unemployment had remained small in historical comparison, and growth in output had remained close to trend. And while trend growth was lower, the decline was small, about a quarter of a percentage point, partly reflecting lower population growth, not lower capital intensity or productivity growth.  14.      Robust broad-based growth was expected to continue. The authorities noted that the unexpected decline in GDP in the September quarter of 2016 was partly a result of falling mining investment and a series of one-off factors including weather-related falls in non-residential </page>

Looking forward, economic growth would be supported by household consumption; another  wave of LNG capacity was expected to ramp up, in 2017 as well as in 2018; public investment growth would rise as States’ infrastructure spending was budgeted to increase further; residential dwelling investment growth, while moderating, would remain strong in the near term; and private business investment would no longer detract from growth in 2018 as the drag from mining investment would ease and non-mining investment would rise moderately. GDP growth would strengthen to around trend rates. The authorities indicated that the economy would thus return to full employment gradually, with underemployment declining and inflation moving back into the target range. While the balance of risks had improved, it remained tilted to the downside, with the possibility of a hard landing in China being a key medium-term concern.  15.      The authorities noted that risks associated with high and rising household leverage had diminished. Tighter bank lending standards, encouraged by prudential measures, had led to slower mortgage credit growth, with improved risks profiles for new loans, and a moderation in housing price growth. Risks related to short-term demand-supply mismatches in housing markets were localized. There were some risks related to lending to real estate developers but those were being closely monitored. Households across all income brackets continue to accumulate deposits in offset accounts, implying that effective household debt was lower, and did not use mortgage borrowing to finance consumption. More resilient bank balance sheets were another factor contributing to diminished housing risks.  ECONOMIC POLICY PRIORITIES 16.      Discussions focused on policy requirements to meet three broad objectives: Completing the economy’s transition to non-mining growth; containing macro-financial vulnerabilities; and enhancing longer-term growth potential.  A.   Supporting Aggregate Demand Context  17.      Australia’s transition to non-mining-based growth has advanced significantly with monetary policy support but the process is not completed. The lack of significant price and wage pressures suggests that some economic slack is still present, which, if prolonged in what has already been a drawn-out adjustment process, risks hurting medium-term supply potential.  18.      The RBA cut the policy rate promptly in response to the unexpected downshift in the expected inflation path in early 2016. The easing also helped to realign the policy rate with interest rates elsewhere, which had declined in some other major advanced economies through September 2016. Staff background work suggests that the equilibrium real interest rate has declined from about 3 percent in the early 1990s to close to 1 percent in the second quarter of 2016 compared to an actual real rate of 0.2 percent, although there is substantial uncertainty around such </page>
<page id="16" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND estimates.5 Absent monetary easing, upward pressure on the Australian dollar would likely have been stronger, reinforcing the disinflationary impulse experienced early in the year.  19.      Australia has substantial fiscal space. Standard metrics suggest that Australia has fiscal space under both the baseline and economic stress scenarios (Annex VI—External and Fiscal Debt Sustainability Analysis). For example, sovereign spreads over U.S. bonds have been relatively moderate in the past 12 months (at most 64 basis points); gross debt is still low at 40 percent of GDP compared with other major advanced economies.  20.      The federal government has recently aimed for substantial near-term fiscal consolidation but budget targets have not been met because of weaker nominal income. Automatic stabilizers have been allowed to operate in response to weaker growth and lower inflation, and the fiscal stance in 2016 is estimated to have been broadly neutral. Against this backdrop, concerns about recent public debt increases and what they mean for Australia’s top-ranked sovereign debt rating have dominated fiscal policy discussions.  21.      In the FY2016/17 budget, the government has projected a return to fiscal balance by FY2020/21. It has also renewed its commitment to a federal government surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the business cycle as a medium-term fiscal anchor, which would imply a cumulative adjustment of up to 3.4 percent of GDP. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2016-17 (MYEFO), released on December 19, 2016 foresees a cumulative adjustment of the fiscal balance of 2.1 percent of GDP by end of FY2019/20, as revenues strengthen in line with the economy, primarily related to stronger personal income tax collection because of bracket creep. Staff Views 22.      The RBA’s monetary policy stance should remain accommodative until the return of inflation to the mid-point of the target range is highly secured. Australia has not experienced the persistent low inflation problem of other advanced economies, and medium-term inflation expectations, while lower, have generally remained within the target range. But with economic slack expected to decline only gradually and taking into account downside risks, policy decisions should remain predicated on the possibility that the return of inflation back to target may take longer, consistent with recent international experience. And in current circumstances, there are asymmetric costs to inflation risks, given policy objectives. The risk of inflation rising faster than expected is less costly than risks of inflation being lower. Monetary policy can likely respond more effectively to positive surprises for some time, given that from current policy settings, policy rates may rapidly reach the effective lower bound if negative surprises reflect large shocks to demand.  23.      The RBA could consider enhancing its policy communication given the inflation outlook and the risk of hitting the effective lower bound under a downside scenario. While increases of longer-term interest rates in advanced economies since October are suggestive of some                                                    5 See Annex VII for a summary of the forthcoming selected issues paper by Helbling, Kamenik, Karam, Laxton, Wang, and Yao, 2016, “Inflation Targeting in Australia:  Performance, Challenges and Strategy Going Forward.”   </page>
<page id="17" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13 increase in underlying equilibrium interest rates, policy rates in Australia may well stay low for some time. Under these conditions, risks of low inflation becoming entrenched could be reduced through clear guidance by the RBA on the horizon over which inflation is expected to return to the mid-point of the target range and on the likely policy measures should downside risks materialize. To lay the foundation, the RBA could consider lengthening the forecast horizon in its Statements on Monetary Policy. More clarity on the policy rate path, possibly through publication of the RBA’s projected policy rate path, could also enhance the RBA’s communication with markets and price setters.  24.      The government should use its fiscal space for a gradual fiscal consolidation and structural fiscal reform. The conditions calling for more pro-active fiscal stimulus, including policy rates at the effective lower bound and impaired monetary policy transmission, are not present. Some fiscal consolidation remains desirable—not the least in view of a sizeable structural budget deficit and impending medium-term increases in ageing-related spending. However, Australia has the fiscal space to undertake budget repair gradually. Any remaining negative demand effects could be offset by continuing accommodative monetary policy, expenditure switching, and growth-friendly structural fiscal reform. In contrast, a front-loaded fiscal consolidation based on measures would pose too much of a risk to the on-going recovery. The MYEFO 2016-17 shows a fiscal improvement based on an economic recovery, broadly consistent with staff’s views on growth in the coming years. 25.      Structural fiscal reform should focus on supporting growth through increased spending on infrastructure, innovation, labor market integration, and tax reform.  There is room for greater infrastructure investment. While general government spending on infrastructure has increased in FY2016/17, this increase primarily reflects higher spending by States, not the Commonwealth. Indeed, capital spending is expected to increase by ½ of a percentage point of GDP in the current budget year, but these efforts are not expected to be sustained as spending is projected to level off in the next fiscal year and to decline thereafter. A more sustained, multi-year increase in spending on efficient infrastructure also at the Commonwealth level would be desirable, considering that Australia has infrastructure needs and fiscal space and the funding environment is favorable.  Reforms that support innovation and productivity should be strengthened. These would include an upgrade of the R&amp;D tax credits put in place last year and active labor market policies, to lower risks of hysteresis in labor markets and support human capital formation in an environment of rapid structural change, increased part-time employment, and higher long-term unemployment.  A tax shift, lowering corporate and household income taxes while increasing the goods and services tax (GST), could boost investment and lift GDP. Background work using the IMF’s G20MOD suggests that in Australia, the long-term multipliers for a 1 percent of GDP shift from corporate income taxes to the GST is roughly 0.6 percent of GDP, while that of </page>
<page id="18" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND labor income taxes to the GST is over 0.1 percent of GDP. A revenue-neutral tax shift should thus lead to a permanent increase in the level of real GDP. 6  26.      Should downside risks materialize, fiscal stimulus may be needed to boost aggregate demand, as monetary policy may rapidly be constrained by the effective lower bound. If the shock is large, an effective macroeconomic policy response may well require expansionary fiscal policy. In a China downside scenario, model-based scenario analysis in background work by staff illustrates how a combined monetary and fiscal policy response ensures a faster recovery (Box 2). With some high-impact downside risks to the near- and medium-term outlook present, contingency plans for expansionary fiscal policy should be prepared, given the implementation lags involved in undertaking fiscal stimulus. Such contingency plans should include a revolving pipeline of ready-to-implement infrastructure projects, with coordination between the Commonwealth and State governments.  27.      An IMF staff review of the fiscal anchor and framework suggests that the authorities consider changing to a long-term debt anchor.7 In 2010, the government raised the medium-term anchor from a zero balance to a surplus of 1 percent, with a view to reverse the recent debt accumulation. In staff’s view, it is a strength of Australia’s fiscal framework that it requires governments to report against a medium-term fiscal strategy based on “principles of sound fiscal management.” But the authorities should consider replacing the current medium-term budget balance anchor with a longer-term debt anchor. The latter would provide certainty about debt and fiscal policy in the future. Once in place, the debt anchor would encourage the government to discuss the implication of unanticipated shocks on the fiscal position and the medium-term fiscal strategy. At the same time, if implemented over a 5- to 10-year horizon, the framework would remain sufficiently flexible to allow for countercyclical fiscal policy support if needed.  Authorities’ Views 28.      The RBA was concerned about the potential costs to financial stability from further monetary easing relative to the benefits of inflation returning to target faster. Against expectations of robust growth and improving labor markets, it considered risks of inflation becoming entrenched below target to be low. The undershooting of core inflation was recent. But the RBA was ready to ease further should the outlook for labor markets and inflation deteriorate materially. RBA officials saw costs and benefits to changing policy communication strategies. While RBA staff were working on extending the forecast horizon, they were concerned that conditional forecasts of the policy rate path could be misread as RBA commitment. RBA officials noted that they could use unconventional monetary policy measures should the need arise, with circumstances dictating the instruments to be used. However, they considered the risks of reaching the effective                                                    6 The benefits of a tax shift are discussed in Box 2 of the selected issues paper by Dizioli, Karam, Muir and Steinlein, 2016, “Australia’s Fiscal Framework: Issues and Options for Reform.” Tax reform options were discussed extensively in the 2015 Article IV Consultation and in Pitt, 2015, “Options for Tax Policy and Federal Fiscal Relations Reform”, Australia Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No.15/275.  7 See Annex VIII for a summary of the selected issues paper by Dizioli and others (2016). </page>
<page id="19" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15 lower bound for policy rates to be low, partly because the Australian dollar usually depreciated in the case of adverse external shocks. This, in turn, could ease the burden on monetary policy in responding to a downturn.  29.      The authorities were less sanguine than staff about the extent of available fiscal space and did not think that current circumstances required its active use. They noted concerns by rating agencies about the sizeable and persistent budget deficits and emphasized that being a capital importing country, which generally runs current account deficits, requires greater fiscal prudence than otherwise. In their view, the economy could absorb the proposed path of fiscal consolidation, noting that much of the expected increase in revenue was through household income tax bracket creep, rather than measures with higher multipliers. However, they agreed that, in the face of negative economic shocks, such as a sharp slowdown in China, increased fiscal spending would need to be considered, as the effectiveness of monetary easing might be diminished. Concerns about a widening current account deficit could be mitigated if it is driven by fiscal spending that encourages stronger domestic investment instead of only weakening saving ratios.  30.      The authorities felt that the composition of fiscal adjustment was as important as the pace of consolidation. In this respect, they noted that past spending increases often focused on recurrent spending. Some of the spending had not been productive, while other spending could be reduced while maintaining or improving outcomes through increased productivity in the delivery of services. Restraining recurrent spending would help in increasing productive spending, on infrastructure investment, nurturing innovation, and on measures encouraging private investment, real wages and incomes in the private sector. This in turn would help on the revenue side as well, particularly for healthy labor income tax revenues, which depend on growth to induce bracket creep.  B.   Managing Macro-Financial Vulnerabilities  Context   31.      Momentum in house prices and housing credit has moderated and bank balance sheets have strengthened with prudential and regulatory steps, but vulnerabilities have not yet decreased materially. Intrinsic housing market risks have become more localized. The escalation of APRA’s supervisory intensity, including guidance on lending standards, over the past year and a half has contributed to lowering growth in new, higher risk lending (e.g., with loan-to-value ratios of more than 80 percent), while housing market conditions have cooled broadly. Nevertheless, risks of renewed price acceleration remain, as mortgage and interest rates more broadly are still low, while foreign investment interest in residential property in the major cities continues to be strong. And high household debt could still amplify the negative impact of large shocks. Regulatory steps under the Basel III framework have contributed to banks’ stronger capital positions. As of January 2016, banks had to meet a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of RWA, and a buffer for domestic systemically important institutions of 1 percent of RWA became effective. The counter-cyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. In addition, in July 2016, a floor for mortgage risk weights for banks using the IRB approach took effect. Tighter prudential rules do </page>

Staff Views 32.      With signs of a cooling housing market, the tightening of prudential measures should remain a contingency. Under the IMF staff’s macro-financial baseline outlook, tighter loan restrictions could accelerate a cooling in housing market, which would be pro-cyclical. In markets where a house price correction has already begun—in the mining states, for example—they risk delaying the recovery from the commodity bust, including by hindering labor mobility. But with continued upside risks to house prices and housing lending growth, APRA should stand ready with targeted prudential measures. Minimum amortization requirements for new loans could also be considered to rein interest-only lending further. 33.      Banks’ should further strengthen their capital position, which would increase their resilience to housing and other macro-financial shocks. This approach would focus on strengthening banks’ ability to absorb losses from a more significant housing market correction. For instance, APRA could consider adjustments to the level of required capital, dependent on banks’ exposure to risky housing market segments and lending standards in those segments (pillar 2 adjustments). Alternatively, it could consider introducing higher minimum risk weights for some lending, notably higher-risk housing-related loans. With expectations of lower profitability in the sector, it will be important for banks to remain in a position to continue to generate sufficient internal capital to finance the growth of their balance sheets and maintain unquestionably strong capital ratios.  34.      In the longer term, the macro-financial resilience of the economy to housing market shocks could be enhanced through tax reform. The Commonwealth tax system provides households with incentives for leveraged real estate investment that likely amplifies housing cycles. The incentives arise from the combination of tax concessions on capital gains and the possibility to apply losses from negative gearing to income from other sources. Reforms of capital gain tax concessions would need to be undertaken in a broader context, to avoid introducing new distortions in the taxation of different assets.  35.      Broader progress in implementing the regulatory reform agenda would also help in lowering and managing financial sector risks. APRA’s efforts to develop an operational framework to assess whether Australian banks are “unquestionable strong” in international comparison will further reduce bank-related financial stability risks. Another priority are reforms recommended in the 2014 Financial Sector Inquiry for increasing the resilience of the banking system, such as the implementation of a framework for loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity and the introduction of a leverage ratio, in the context of international regulatory developments.  36.      The authorities are taking steps to address the lack of adequate AML/CFT safeguards in the real estate sector. In 2015, the Mutual Evaluation Report of Australia’s AML/CFT regime by the Financial Action Task Force found that the real estate sector is exposed to significant money</page>
<page id="21" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 laundering risk and should be subject to AML/CFT safeguards in line with the international standards. In response, Australia has recently completed a statutory review of its AML/CFT regime and initiated a consultation process about regulating real estate professionals under the AML/CFT Act. The cost-benefit analysis of different regulatory models is expected to be completed by July 2017. 37.      Remittance flows from Australia have remained broadly stable while regional correspondent banking relationships with Australian banks have continued. AUSTRAC’s tracking of international funds flowing through financial intermediaries registered in Australia suggests no significant change in patterns or magnitudes of remittance flows. That said, money transfer operators have been subject to structural change, given evolving financial technology, and regulatory change. While some operators have had their bank accounts closed, this has only affected a subset among them. However, money transfer operators have faced increased costs and complexities of doing business. At this stage, there is no evidence that Australian banks have stopped correspondent banking and other business with neighboring Pacific Islands. Nevertheless, recognizing the potential for negative spillovers, the authorities have formed a high-level interdepartmental committee to coordinate policies, intensified consultation with the industry, provided neighboring countries with technical assistance to deal with AML/CFT challenges, and actively engaged in the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.  Authorities’ Views 38.      The authorities concurred that policies should focus on further strengthening resilience to housing market and other shocks with macro-financial implication. Regarding “unquestionably strong” capital ratio of banks, APRA stressed that a top quartile positioning relative to international peers is only one guidepost and that other benchmarks would be used as well. For example, capital positions against rating agency measures of capital strength would be assessed and the result of stress tests can also be informative. In terms of timing, APRA did not expect that final standards on unquestionably strong capital ratio would be released soon, given that 2017 will be a year of consultation. The standards would be unlikely to take effect until at least a year after that to facilitate an orderly build-up of capital. APRA indicated openness to the use of a range of prudential measures in case they are needed.  39.      The Treasury continues its efforts to introduce new legislation to deliver on the Government’s financial system agenda. In its response to the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry (FSI), the government announced 48 measures, including on the crisis management toolkit, banks resolution, and consumer protection, which require legislation to be prepared and worked through the legislative process. C.   Keeping Up Productivity Growth 40.      Maintaining high productivity growth rates may be challenging. Aggregate labor productivity growth in Australia has remained stable over the past decade and a half, increasing at an annual average rate of around 1.5 percent. More recently, however, labor productivity growth has</page>
<page id="22" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND slowed, with weaker multifactor productivity especially in the services sectors, which have accounted for most of the growth in employment since the end of the mining boom. At the same time, weak non-mining investment has likely resulted in less capital deepening.  41.      Moving ahead with a range of smaller reforms may nevertheless boost productivity. After a wave of reforms in the early 1990s, there are few low-hanging fruit in terms of large-scale structural policies. Australia generally ranks favorably compared to other OECD countries in key “ease of doing business” areas, although its relatively favorable position has eroded over time as other countries have also improved and progress on reforms in Australia has slowed. Policy priorities have been identified in commissioned expert Reviews and Inquiries, while the Productivity Commission provides the government with research and analysis. The reform agenda, including on the tax side, has been shaped by the 2015 Competition Policy Review (“Harper Review”) and the 2014 Financial System Inquiry (“Murray Inquiry”).  Staff Views 42.      Recent structural reforms have appropriately focused on fostering innovation. Innovation is key to factor productivity growth, but there are sizeable gaps relative to the frontier in this dimension. Investment in knowledge capital is relatively low in Australia, partly reflecting low R&amp;D spending relative to other advanced economies. The government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) allocates $1.1 billion (less than 0.1 percent of GDP) over four years to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in the high-tech sector, including through tax breaks. Recognizing the difficulties in fostering innovation through policies, the authorities are closely monitoring outcomes to ensure policy effectiveness. The government plans to continue and expand the program if it proves to be effective.  43.      Product market reforms can be expanded in targeted areas. The Harper Review has identified a number of reforms to boost competition and productivity in the services sectors, and to strengthen competition policy broadly. Some of the major benefits from the proposed measures arise from reforms to increase competition in the delivery of human services on behalf of governments, and in other markets including construction, retail trade, and transport. A number of these reforms will have to be implemented at the state level, which will require complex coordination between the Commonwealth and State governments, in legislation and through intergovernmental agreements. Legislation for key components are still under preparation, and efforts to expedite implementation of the Harper Review would be beneficial. In addition, efforts to increase competition in the financial sector, including through implementation of measures identified in the Murray Inquiry, should continue.  44.      Trade liberalization is another means to increase competition and Australia intends to continue efforts towards further liberalization in regional and multilateral fora. Aside from benefiting from traditional lines of exports, Australia would also stand to gain from enhanced access to service export markets, which would also serve to strengthen service sector productivity in Australia. At the same time, active labor market policies and the social safety net would help to mitigate the cost to those who would bear the burden of adjustment. </page>
<page id="23" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 45.      Tax reforms appear challenging in the current political environment. The government managed to achieve passage of a tax cut for small business in the current Budget, but has yet to introduce similar measures for larger firms. Such a measure should be part of a package of broader reforms that remains to be accomplished, including reducing tax concessions, and the shift in the tax mix discussed above as part of structural fiscal reforms. Such reforms could enhance productivity.  46.      Labor markets have performed well. The flexible labor market settings have contributed to a smooth adjustment from the mining boom with low unemployment. However, the elevated rate of underemployment, and persistent youth unemployment could lead to diminished incentives to accumulate human capital if not addressed. While the gradual elimination of economic slack should help to ease some of the potential for problems, the authorities should remain vigilant to prevent deepening skill mismatches and labor market hysteresis. In this context, the government’s $840 million Youth Employment Package, which seeks to increase employability of youth mainly through wage subsidies, is a welcome step. Authorities’ Views 47.      The authorities agreed that the productivity growth environment is challenging. While labor productivity growth has been stable, it is expected to grow at a somewhat slower rate over the next few years. Moreover, half the aggregate labor productivity growth recorded recently was contributed by the mining sector, which has moved to the less labor-intensive production phase after a long investment phase.  48.      The authorities aimed to improve productivity through targeted steps, with legislative steps under preparation. With key economy-wide reforms already implemented, future productivity gains would require specific measures, which include increasing contestability in markets for services, and boosting innovation capacity and absorption. Reforms identified in the Harper Review would primarily have to be implemented at the state level, and would require close coordination between the Commonwealth and State governments. The government is finalizing intergovernmental agreements and National Partnerships detailing funding for measures taken at the state level. These Partnerships are expected to be formed by mid-2017 to mid-2018. Other reforms proposed in the Harper Review can be implemented by the Commonwealth government and may be introduced as early as mid-2017.  49.      Innovation was emphasized as a priority. The government’s NISA would help to boost innovation capacity by seeking to encourage entrepreneurship, and to enhance industry-science collaboration. Future waves of NISA would envisage building science capability in niche areas such as health or data analytics, encouraging private sector investment in innovation and making it easier for business to interact with Government.  50.      The authorities were pressing ahead with trade liberalization. They were committed to the passage of the TPP. Even if it were not to come into force because some other signatories may not pass it, the authorities were committed to implementing as many of its provisions as possible by </page>
<page id="24" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND other means such as bilateral agreements – for example, the recent expansion of its 2003 free trade agreement with Singapore. They were also interested in continuing negotiations for the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), which includes China and the Asia-Pacific TPP signatories. STAFF APPRAISAL 51.      Context. Australia has experienced robust growth and low unemployment during the drawn-out adjustment to the commodity price and mining investment bust, highlighting the resilience of the economy and strong policy frameworks. But it has not been immune to symptoms of the “new mediocre.” Wage and price pressures have been weak, underemployment has risen, and private business investment outside mining has been lackluster. 52.      Outlook and risks. After a growth pickup from mid-2015, real GDP unexpectedly contracted in 2016Q3, largely on account of one-off factors, so growth close to trend is expected to resume. The balance of risks to the growth outlook improved in 2016 but remains tilted to the downside. While recent terms-of-trade improvements provide for some upside, domestic demand could remain lackluster with continued weak wage growth and underemployment. A major concern is that high-impact external risks could interact with or even trigger domestic risks, especially a housing correction.  53.      On the macro-financial side, prudential policies have contributed to a tentative stabilization of housing-related and external vulnerabilities. APRA’s prudential measures introduced in late 2014 have improved the risk profile of new loans. While household debt has remained high, risks to banks and to household balance sheets have been mitigated by the strong growth in mortgage buffers. The macro-financial risk outlook has also improved as banks’ balance sheets have become more resilient with higher capital ratios and a higher share of stable funding.  54.      The economic policy agenda should center on three priorities: Demand support to ensure completion of the transition to non-mining-based growth; further reductions in macro-financial vulnerabilities, and reforms to enhance the longer-term growth potential.    55.      The monetary policy stance should remain accommodative. Australia’s low inflation is more recent, but policy decisions should remain predicated on the possibility that inflation may return into the target range later than expected, given international experience. Prudential measures to address housing-related risks have mitigated risks to balance sheets and financial stability from lower policy rates.  56.      Australia still has substantial fiscal space despite recent public debt increases, which allows for a gradual approach to fiscal consolidation and higher growth-friendly spending.   The government appropriately plans to balance the budget over four years, while making the expenditure composition more growth-friendly. Efforts focus on supporting longer-term inclusive growth, including by boosting innovation and tax reform.   The envisaged fiscal consolidation risks being too front-loaded. Over the next two years, the budget targets reductions in the structural budget deficit of close to 1½ percent. This </page>
<page id="25" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21 ambitious pace risks being counterproductive in the current phase of the recovery, especially if it does not provide for the increases in productive spending needed to support longer-term growth.   A more sustained public investment effort. A multi-year increase in spending on efficient infrastructure beyond the planned current short-lived increase would be desirable, considering that Australia has infrastructure needs and fiscal space.  57.      If high-impact downside risks were to materialize, fiscal policy should support aggregate demand, as monetary policy could be constrained by the effective lower bound. Developing contingency plans and a pipeline of infrastructure projects would help reduce implementation lags in undertaking fiscal stimulus.  58.      With more acute risks concentrated in a few specific housing market segments, policies should focus on further strengthening resilience to housing market and other shocks with macro-financial implications.   With continued upside risks to house prices, APRA should stand ready to intensify targeted prudential measures, if lending or house price growth were to re-accelerate.   APRA should continue to actively encourage banks’ efforts to robustly anchor their capital position in “unquestionably strong” territory, given a highly concentrated banking sector where banks have similar business models.  Treasury’s preparation of new legislation to further the regulatory reform agenda should continue to complete the implementation of the FSI recommendations. APRA should continue in its effort to implement prudential steps to strengthen the loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity of banks and introduce leverage ratios, in line with the international agenda. 59.      The government’s structural reform agenda appropriately focuses on fostering innovation and strengthening competition, and the intention to push for trade liberalization is welcome. The NISA, is an important step forward. The efforts should continue, as currently envisaged, and, if effective, be expanded. The measures recommended by the Harper Review would strengthen services sector competition and productivity, but implementation will require determined effort. Expanding access to service export markets could also strengthen services sector productivity in Australia and elsewhere, while the social safety net and active labor market policies could mitigate the cost to those who bear the burden of adjustment.  60.      It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.   </page>

Commercial real estate (CRE) prices in Australia have increased rapidly since mid-2014. Rents have not followed at the same pace, and the price-to-rent (PR) ratio is now above average. Whether the latter is a good metric of fair value is difficult to assess. But the deviations from average are now close to levels last seen before the global financial crisis. Shortly thereafter, there was a sharp correction in CRE prices in the context of the crisis. Internationally, Australia’s CRE PR ratio is closer to the pre-crisis maximum than in almost all other countries for which data are available, with the notable exception of the United States and Canada. The valuation increases may in part reflect the strong interest of foreign investors in Australian CRE assets.     Risks to financial stability from any potential CRE overvaluation appear manageable. The share of CRE lending in commercial banks’ total assets decreased in the past few years and has now stabilized at around 5 percent. Even so, banks’ lending growth to CRE has been rising recently, with increased contribution by Australian branches of foreign banks. The share of impaired CRE assets over total CRE assets has declined and the impaired assets are almost fully provisioned. While a downturn in the CRE market would likely not pose a major financial stability risk, it may still have important macroeconomic effects as Australia’s CRE capital expenditures as a percent of GDP are relatively high in comparison. 89101112131415161718Price to Rent ratioAverage between 1995Q2 to 2016Q1Price to Rent Ratio(%)Sources: MSCI;and IMF staff calculations.-60-40-20020406080100MaxCurrentMinPrice to Rent Ratio(% deviation from historical mean, max and min during 2006Q1 to 2016Q1)Sources: MSCI;and IMF staff calculations.050001000015000200002500030000ChinaUSSingaporeJapanCanadaUKMalaysiaThilandSouth KoreaHong KongGermanyUAESwitzerlandNetherlandsNew ZealandBrazilFranceSpainOthersApprovals by Country of Investor on Real Estate in 2014-2015(In millions of AUD)</page>

A China Downside Scenario with Monetary and Fiscal Policy Responses  Disappointing external environment may require a ‘low for longer’ strategy for monetary policy. We consider alternative simulations where China’s economic growth surprises on the downside. This has significant spillover effects on the rest of the world and a sizable impact on commodity prices. This downside scenario implies an opening up of the effective foreign output gap relevant for the Australian economy (defined as export-weighted output gaps for Australia’s main trading partners). Specifically, the effective foreign output gap is 2.3 percentage points lower and metal prices are 5.3 percent lower at the trough compared to the baseline. Under the blue line, in anticipation of the negative shocks, the policy rate declines to the effective lower bound (assumed to be 0.75 percent) and stays there for 2 years. This results in a further depreciation in the Australian dollar that helps support the economy. However, a sizable negative output gap remains for the Australian economy as largely dominated by the magnitude of the negative shock. Headline inflation slightly overshoots the 2.5 percent mid-point of the RBA’s 2-3 percent inflation target range. A combined monetary-fiscal policy would provide a much-needed shot in the arm for the Australian economy if the downside shocks were to materialize. Under this case, a direct fiscal stimulus is used to help deal with the negative external shocks hitting the Australian economy. The direct effects of the fiscal stimulus are equal to 0.25 percent of GDP for 2017-18. Monetary policy provides the ‘supporting role’ to a much-welcomed fiscal expansion by cutting the policy rate aggressively to its lower bound faster than under the previous case. This helps raise inflation and generate a modest overshoot of inflation above the upper bound of the 2-3 percent target range over the medium term. This planned overshoot of inflation raises inflation expectations and reduces the real interest rates, which combined with more depreciated exchange rate helps close the output gap much faster. A faster recovery of the economy under this more accommodative strategy allows monetary policy to renormalize earlier than under the previous case.       0.51.01.52.02.53.02016:12016:32017:12017:32018:12018:32019:12019:3Policy Rate(%, p.a.)-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.52016:12016:32017:12017:32018:12018:32019:12019:3Output Gap(%)1.21.31.41.51.62016:12016:32017:12017:32018:12018:32019:12019:3Exchange Rate(AUD per 1 USD)1.01.52.02.53.03.54.02016:12016:32017:12017:32018:12018:32019:12019:3Headline Inflation(%, Y/Y)</page>

The sizeable bust in commodity prices and rapid decline in mining investment has been weathered well by the Australian economy. The decline in investment has been partly offset by rising resource exports, supporting value addition and employment linked to the resource sector in other industries. Household real incomes have been shielded from the commodity price bust as profits have absorbed much of the decline. This annex examines some of the factors limiting the negative impact of a historic boom-bust cycle in mining investment and commodity prices on the economy. Over the boom period, mining investment rose from its average of around 2 percent of GDP to over 9 percent by 2013, net terms of trade doubled, and resource exports rose from 6 percent of GDP to 11 percent. Expansion of mining also increased demand for other industries, and the value added share of the broadly defined “resource sector” including directly extractive industries and support industries in aggregate nominal gross value added rose from 4¼ percent  over 1990-2004 to 14¼ percent in 2011/12.1 The share of the resource sector in employment doubled from around 5 percent over 1990-2004 to just under 10 percent in 2011/12, mostly among support industries, while the employment share of the mining sector itself remained around 2 percent. Four years into the bust, mining investment has declined sharply, but growing resource exports have dampened the negative impact of declining investment, and will continue to do so in the near term as new capacities ramp up and investment returns to more normal levels. Resource sector value added peaked at 15.5 percent of GDP in 2013/14, following the peak in mining investment. About half (8 percent of GDP) was value addition within the mining sector itself. The remainder was value addition in support sectors: 4 percent of GDP due to mining exports, and 3¼ percent of GDP due to investment (chart 1; table 1 lists the contribution of key support industries). Export-related value addition is expected to support a gradual decline in resource value added to around 11 percent of GDP by 2017/18.  Resource sector employment also peaked in 2013/14 at 10 percent of total employment (chart 2), of which only 2 percent was in direct mining activity and the rest was in support sectors. By 2015/16, resource employment declined only gradually, in line with the decline in resource sector value added. In addition, the investment decline has been cushioned by a strong housing sector, particularly for the construction sector which had a relatively higher exposure to mining investment.  The impact of the decline in commodity prices on household incomes has been mitigated by declining profits. Australia had experienced a so called “income recession” in late-2015 (adjusting GDP for the terms of trade decline), but real producer wages have in fact risen sharply since the end of the boom despite weaker nominal wage growth (chart 3), indicating that the impact of lower output prices has not been transferred entirely to wages. Producer wages stayed relatively low during the boom, and the share of profits in income was rising, whereas it has steadily declined since the 2011 peak in commodity prices. Moreover, consumer wages rose faster than producer wages during the boom, due in part to exchange rate appreciation. Estimates of exchange rate pass-through to CPI prices in Australia suggest that a 10 percent appreciation is linked with a 1 percent decline in consumer prices, which would imply a sizeable impact given the large real appreciation. On the downswing, depreciation has not translated into retail inflation as expected, which may be attributed to both weaker import prices (as manufacturing shifts globally to cheaper locations) and more domestic retail sector competition.                                                    1Based on the” narrow measure” as described in Rayner and Bishop (2013). The analysis here extends their work, with the latest input-output table for 2013-14, and projected resource exports and investment. Resource sector value added estimates are broadly comparable to the “narrow measure” noted above. Resource related employment in an industry is assumed to be proportional to the share of resource sector related value added share in total industry value added. </page>

Australia’s External Balance Sheet: Developments and  Risk Profile Australia’s net external liability position increased markedly over the past year. This annex documents that this increase largely reflected a set of atypical valuation effects and, for the ratio to GDP, exceptionally low nominal GDP growth that are atypical compared to usual patterns. The risk profile of Australia’s net external position, however, has remained broadly stable.   Net foreign liabilities amounted to 63 percent of GDP by the end of 2016Q3, about 7 percentage points higher than they were in mid-2015. This unusually steep increase occurred even though the current account deficit shrunk from around 5 percent of GDP to below 3 percent of GDP over the same period. Valuation effects—changes in the market value of external assets and liabilities—partly explain the contrasting behavior. Nominal GDP growth was exceptionally low because of sharply deteriorating terms of trade through the first half of 2016. Australia stands second to New Zealand among AAA-rated countries in relative size of net foreign liabilities to GDP.      Valuation effects have mitigated the impact of persistent current account deficits on Australia’s net external liabilities. As of 2016Q3, the cumulated current account deficits since 1988Q3 (the period during which quarterly balance of payments statistics are available) amounted to about 72 percent of GDP. Offsetting this, valuation effects helped improve the net external liabilities by 10 percentage points of GDP over the same period. Analysis of the valuation effects following an approach reviewed by Gourinchas and Rey (2015) suggests that the return on external assets has been some half of a percentage point higher than that on external liabilities.1 Despite external liabilities being substantially larger than external assets, the rate of return on the net external assets has still been positive. But it has been smaller than the rate of growth. Australia’s debt-stabilizing current account deficit has thus been close to 4 percent of GDP.   Over the past year, negative valuation effects, especially losses on Australia’s equity assets, have resulted in a higher return on its net external liabilities. At the same time, the nominal GDP                                                    1 In this approach, the residual from the stock-flow reconciliation are considered to be mis-measured capital gains and are added to the valuation effects.  4850525456586062640501001502002502006200720082009201020112012201320142015Foreign Liabilities and Assets(% of GDP)Net liabilities (RHS)Foreign liabilitiesForeign assets2016Source:Haver Analytics.-250-200-150-100-50050100150200250IrelandGreeceCyprusPortugalSpainNew ZealandAustraliaU.S.FranceU.K.FinlandSwedenAustriaCanadaLuxembourgDenmarkGermanyNetherlandsBelgiumSwissNorwayNet International Investment Position(% of GDP, blue bars for AAA rated countries)Source:Haver Analytics.</page>
<page id="46" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 42 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND growth was exceptionally low because of the impact on the GDP deflator of the large terms-of-trade declines during the period. In the absence of valuation effects over the forecast horizon, the expected pickup in nominal GDP growth should result in a broadly stable net external liability position.       The structure of Australia’s net external liabilities has remained broadly stable in terms of currency and asset composition, but its sectoral composition has changed.    Currency. As of mid-2016, 87 percent of liabilities were denominated in domestic currency, while 56 percent of assets are in foreign currencies. On net, Australia thus had a long foreign currency position equals to 49 percent of GDP. The implication is that depreciation of the Australian dollar against the currencies in which its external assets are invested in leads to improvements in the external balance sheet. In the aggregate, depreciation does not come with the adverse balance sheet effects it would have with a net short foreign-currency position. For individual firms or households, however, there could still be negative effects. But banks’ debt service obligations in foreign currency are fully hedged, while mining companies have natural hedges given commodity pricing standards.     Maturity and Type. At the end of 2016Q3, 87 percent of net liabilities are in long-term debt instruments (exceeding 1 year in maturity) and 14 percent in short-term debt, the net long position in equity is broadly balanced. The share of short-term external debt liabilities has decreased in recent years, partly because of banks increasing the share of more stable, longer-term debt in their wholesale funding.  -80-70-60-50-40-30-20-10019881992199620002004200820122016(% of GDP)Net Foreign LiabilitiesCumulated CANIIPSource: Haver Analytics.Note: Cumulated CA is calculated by adding cumulated CA balance to NIIP at the end of 1988Q2. -70-60-50-40-30-20-100-20-15-10-5051019881992199620002004200820122016(% of GDP)Net Equity and Net DebtSource: Haver Analytics.</page>

At about 40 percent, the sector accounts for the largest share of total net external liabilities. Banks now account for some 36 percent. With greater emphasis on stable funding sources, their net external liabilities as a share of GDP have decreased by about 3 percentage points of GDP since the global financial crisis. With the housing boom, the real estate sector has also posted an increase in its net external liabilities, increasing from 0.4 to 11.7 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2016.3 The other financial sector, which includes superannuation (the private second pension pillar), is the only private sector with a net foreign asset position. Its net position has increased by some 20 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the net accumulation of assets in the sector (contributions exceed withdrawals in the aggregate), some of which are invested abroad.   Banks’ exposure by country. Banks heavily rely on the UK and the US for funding, with a combined share in net liabilities of 103 percent. Banks have net assets with China, New Zealand and France.                                                      2 External liabilities calculated on the basis of monetary and balance of payments data. 3 Data on the sectoral composition of external assets and liabilities are available for the period since 2006Q2. -50050100150200LiabilitiesAssetsNetLiabilitiesLiabilitiesAssetsNetLiabilities2006Q32016Q2Foreign CurrenciesAUDComposition by Currency(%of GDP)Sources:Haver Analytics; and RBA.-203080130180LiabilitiesAssetsNetLiabilitiesLiabilitiesAssetsNetLiabilities2006Q32016Q2Less than 1 yearGreater than 1 yearEquityComposition by Maturity(% of GDP)Source:Haver Analytics.-30-20-100102030BanksOther financial and insurance SvcMiningManufacturingElec, Gas, Water &amp; Waste SvcWholesale TradeRetail TradeTrans, Postal &amp; WarehousingReal Estate SvcOther IndustriesUnallocatedNet Foreign Liabilities(% of GDP)Q2.16Q3.06Source:Haver Analytics.-505101520Banks' Net Foreign Liabilities(% of GDP)2006Q32016Q2Source:Haver Analytics.</page>

Summary – Labor Market Adjustment to Shocks in Australia  Australia’s labor markets were relatively little disrupted by the global financial crisis, and are adjusting smoothly to the sizeable commodity price bust and mining investment decline. Unemployment rose relatively little post-GFC compared to other advanced economies. After the commodity price bust, unemployment peaked at 6¼ percent in mid-2015 and has been declining since, and the unemployment gap is assessed to be small.  However, some labor market indicators suggest persistent weakness. For instance, long-term unemployment remains elevated. Underemployment has also persisted above long run averages, and is a possible driver of weaker wage growth since the commodity price bust.  In this context, the paper conducts a more detailed assessment of the labor market impact of the adverse shocks. It addresses the following key questions:  o Has the commodity price bust and mining investment decline led to a worsening in skills mismatch and other frictions? o Have cyclical labor adjustment dynamics changed over time? What are the implications for assessment of labor market slack, and relatedly for wage growth? o Has changing sectoral allocation of labor had an impact in the transition? o What is the role played by migration in state level adjustment to shocks, particularly in the context of the commodity boom-bust cycle?  Salient findings for policy analysis consideration are as follows: o Beveridge curve analysis suggests that the increase in long-term unemployment does not indicate any significant worsening in structural unemployment since the commodity price bust. o Average hours worked have adjusted more flexibly in downturns, with employment reductions smaller since the 2000s. However, rising part time employment and falling average hours worked are likely driving higher underemployment. A wage Phillips curve suggests that underemployment helps explain some of the recent weakness in wage growth. o Aggregate labor productivity growth has on average remained stable in the 2000s, but more recently, the expansion of services employment has contributed to the weakness in labor productivity growth. o At the state level, a VAR analysis suggests that changes in migration have played a key role in the supply side response to employment (demand) shocks, supporting a smooth adjustment particularly in the context of the mining boom-bust cycle.  </page>
<page id="49" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="90">   Australia Overall Assessment Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory Background. Australia has a high negativenet international investment position (NIIP) of -63 percent of GDP (as of mid-2016). The ratio has varied in a range between -40 and -60 percent of GDP since 1988. Liabilities are largely denominated in Australian dollars while assets are in foreign currency. Foreign liabilities are composed of around one quarter of FDI, one half of portfolio investment (principally banks borrowing abroad and foreign holdings of government bonds), and one quarter of other investment and derivatives. With the current account deficit expected to rise to its long run average of around 4 percent of GDP over the medium term, the NIIP to GDP ratio would rise to around 68 percent of GDP.  Assessment.  The NIIP level and trajectory are sustainable. The structure of Australia’s external balance sheet reduces the vulnerability associated with its large negative NIIP. Since Australia’s NIIP liabilities are mainly in Australian dollars and there is a net foreign currency asset position, a nominal depreciation tends to strengthen the external balance sheet, all else equal. The banking sector has a net foreign currency liability position but it is fully hedged. The maturity of banks’ external funding has improved since the global financial crisis, and even in a tail risk event where domestic banks suffer a major loss, the government’s strong balance sheet position allows it to offer credible support.   Overall Assessment:   In 2016 the external position was assessed to be moderately weaker than the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies. The widening of the current account deficit in 2015, notwithstanding substantial currency depreciation in 2014-15, was likely temporary, partly reflecting exceptionally large terms of trade declines in the context of commodity price declines and stronger-than-expected domestic demand growth in a weaker external environment. The Australian dollar has depreciated with the large deterioration in the terms of trade and supported expenditure switching, including by boosting services and non-resource exports. The depreciation in 2014-15 likely reduced the overvaluation of the Australian dollar, although the correction has stalled in recent months. Some remaining exchange rate overvaluation might be accounted for by the relative attractiveness of highly-rated Australian assets.   Potential policy responses: If growth remains on the weak side, or commodity prices fall further driven by weaker global demand conditions, further monetary accommodation would be warranted.   The government’s planned gradual fiscal consolidation over the longer term should help improve the current account by boosting national savings. Current account  Background. Australia has run current account (CA) deficits for most of its history. Since the early 1980s, deficits have averaged around 4 percent of GDP. In 2015, the deficit widened by 1¾ percentage points to 4.8 percent, reflecting an unusually large decline in the terms of trade (iron ore prices fell by over 40 percent in 2015), stronger domestic demand in Australia, and relatively weaker external demand.  The current account deficit is expected to narrow in 2016, partly reflecting the lagged effects of currency depreciation in 2014/15, which has boosted services and non-resource exports, and new resource export capacity coming on stream. Over the medium term, the deficit is expected to be around 4 percent of GDP, with a moderately larger trade deficit. However, with over half of Australia’s exports going to emerging Asia, a key risk is a sharper than expected slowdown in China which could result in a further sharp decline in commodities prices.  Assessment. Australia’s persistent CA deficits reflect a structural saving-investment imbalance with very high private investment relative to a saving rate which is already high by advanced country standards. After accounting for Australia-specific factors driving investment, the staff assessment is that the cyclically-adjusted current account is some 0-2 percent of GDP below the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings in 2015. This assessment is subject to uncertainty given that it depends on how non-oil commodity prices evolve. 1/ Real exchange rate   Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated 7 percent in 2015 relative to its 2014 average. As of June 2016, the REER depreciated by less than ½ percent compared to its 2015 averages. Compared to its thirty-year average, the REER is some 14 percent higher. Continued substantial capital inflows and favorable interest rate differentials may have contributed to the continued relative strength of the Australian dollar. Since mid-2015, the currency has been broadly stable in real effective terms. Assessment. Taking into account these factors including the attractiveness of highly rated Australian assets, staff assesses the REER to be 0 to15 percent above the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. 2/ Capital and financial accounts:  flows and policy measures Background. The mining investment boom has been funded predominantly offshore. Net FDI inflows into this sector have partially offset the reduced need for the banking sector to borrow abroad. As investment in new mining projects winds down, related demand for imports will decrease, buffering the impact on the overall balance of payments. Australia also received large inflows in recent years into bond markets given its sound fiscal position relative to other advanced economies, and owing to relatively high interest rate differentials. Assessment. Credible commitment to a floating exchange rate and a strong fiscal position limit the vulnerabilities. FX intervention and reserves level Background. A free-floater since 1983. The central bank undertook brief but large intervention in 2007–08 when the market for Australian dollars became illiquid (bid-ask spreads widened) following banking sector disruptions in the U.S. The authorities are strongly committed to a floating regime which reduces the need for reserve holding.  Assessment. Although domestic banks’ external liabilities are sizable, they are either in local currency or hedged with little or no counterparty risks, so reserve needs for prudential reasons are also limited. Technical Background Notes  1/ The EBA CA regression approach for 2016 estimates a CA norm of -1.0 percent of GDP and a CA gap of -1.9percent of GDP. Using estimated elasticities, the current account approach would be consistent with an exchange rate overvaluation of around 11 percent in 2016. However, the estimates of the CA norm may not capture Australia-specific factors such as the attractiveness of Australian assets to overseas investors. If such factors were considered, the current account norm might be for a deficit larger than 1 percent of GDP. The NFA stabilizing deficit is closer to 2½-3 percent of GDP. Our assessment is therefore that the current account gap is in the range of -2 to 0 percent of GDP.  2/ The EBA REER regression approach, and the EBA REER level regression provide estimates of a gap encompassing a wide range from 5 to 15 percent in 2016.

Summary – Inflation Targeting in Australia: Performance, Challenges and Strategy Going Forward The Australian model of flexible inflation targeting has been a success, as evidenced by average inflation consistent with the target, and a substantial moderation in inflation and output volatility.  Belatedly, monetary policy in Australia has also faced some of the challenges that other central banks have faced after the global financial crisis, albeit not to the same extent.   A slower-than-expected recovery, economic slack, and inflation declining below target in a difficult global economic environment.  An increased probability of hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal policy rates, given declines in the real equilibrium interest rate (EIR) and some possibly large downside risks (e.g. China, European banks, geo-political uncertainty, etc.).  Risk of more persistent deviations of inflation below target (“low inflation trap”) and prolonged slack.  Staff estimates of the real EIR in Australia suggest that it has declined from around two percent in mid-2008 to around 1 percent over the past two years. The policy rate has been below the equilibrium throughout most of the post-GFC recovery, indicating that monetary policy has been in a ‘loose’ stance. In the current situation, the prudent policy strategy would be a “low for longer” monetary policy stance while preparing for coordinated monetary and fiscal policy easing if downside risks were to materialize.   Around the current baseline outlook, a ‘prudent risk-management strategy’ would be to respond more strongly to negative inflation and output surprises than to positive ones.   To lower risks of ‘dark corners’, an effective policy response would call for both expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in the event that large negative shocks were to materialize (e.g., lower global growth and commodity prices).  Enhancing policy transparency   A more forecast-oriented communication policy which could include more explicit discussion of how the RBA intends to use its policy instruments over time to bring inflation back to target.    </page>

Summary – Australia’s Fiscal Framework:  Issues and Options for Reform This paper reviews the Government of Australia’s approach to framing fiscal policy.   Trying to meet its objectives of stabilization, long-term sustainability, and support of intergenerational equity. It aims for a medium-term balance anchor of 1 percent of GDP budget surplus, on average, over the economic cycle and to control debt accumulation.   Amid long-term spending pressures from demographics – pensions, health care, aged care. The analysis is based upon the use of the IMF’s model, G20MOD.  Comprises the entire world, with a block specifically for Australia. It models households, firms, the government and the central bank, calibrated to match Australia’s macroeconomic and fiscal characteristics.   The fiscal sector is fairly rich, with eight tax and spending instruments. Since government debt levels help determine global interest rates, long-term net foreign asset holdings and real exchange rates, fiscal policy plays a key role in both the short and long term. Propose options for fiscal rules best suited to Australia to anchor fiscal policy.   Based on IMF work on fiscal rules (IMF, 2009, “Fiscal Rules – Anchoring Expectations for Sustainable Public Finances,” IMF Staff Paper, December, 2009), with some of the methodology derived from the Canada 2014 Article IV paper (Kinda, 2014, “Anchoring Sustainable Fiscal Policy: A New Fiscal Rule in Canada,” in Canada: Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 15/23) Short-term budget repair to achieve the medium-term balance anchor. The analysis shows that the Government should be cautious about the pace of budget repair.   There is uncertainty on the required magnitude for budget repair.  Relies on rebalancing away from the domestic to external sector, which may not be a desirable choice of fiscal authorities at this juncture.   It can be very costly under the primary risk of the “new mediocre.” Implement a long-term debt anchor to provide a stronger long-term fiscal framework.   To achieve and maintain this, we propose an appropriate mix from three types of fiscal rules:  An expenditure rule limiting spending growth from 2021-2030—quantifies existing government commitment to reduce the size of government and harks back to expenditure rules used in the past;  Medium-term balance anchor (a flexible budget balance rule)—this is the target currently in force; </page>
<page id="56" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">AUSTRALIA 52 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  Different configurations of debt rules – both strict and flexible, achieving a new debt target over either a 5- or 10-year horizon. Compare strengths of the long-term debt anchor and the medium-term balance anchor.   Both targets have to be met on average over the economic cycle (a degree of flexibility that is already present in the existing medium-term balance anchor) and communicated clearly through various vehicles such as the annual budget and the mid-year updates.  A long-term debt anchor provides certainty about the level of the debt and its role in anchoring households’ and firms’ behavior.  A long-term debt anchor provides greater stability for real GDP in both temporary and permanent shocks relative to a medium-term balance anchor. The paper analyzes three different debt rules. It examines an example consolidation of 10 percent of debt under the benchmark scenario as well as a couple of possible alternatives – stronger aggregate demand and a boom-bust cycle driven by the terms of trade.   A preferred mixed rule strategy combines an expenditure rule with the flexible debt rule aiming to reduce the debt over 10 years assessed against a number of stabilization and debt-control related indicators.  The analysis also demonstrates that clear communications will ease the transition for the implementation of rule against the background of long-term spending pressures from demographics.   </page>

This supplement summarizes the main developments since the staff report was issued on January 18, 2017. The developments are consistent with the analysis and assessment presented in the staff report, and do not require a change in the staff appraisal.  2. Consumer price inflation was broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2016. Headline CPI rose by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, unchanged from the third quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it rose by 1.5 percent, up from 1.4 percent. Core CPI rose by 0.4 percent against the previous quarter and 1.6 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, up from an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the previous quarter.   3. The unemployment rate increased to 5.8 percent in the last quarter of 2016, from 5.6 percent in the previous quarter. This increase reflected a combination of faster labor force growth and slightly lower employment growth compared to developments in the previous quarter.   4. The terms of trade improved by 19.0 percent against the previous quarter, compared to an expected improvement of 7.0 percent. The stronger outcome largely reflected stronger coal and iron prices. However, spot prices for these commodities have started to decline recently as expected, partly reflecting increased domestic supply in China.   </page>
<page id="62" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0"> Statement by Christine Barron, Alternate Executive Director for Australia  and Christopher Stewart, Advisor to Executive Director February 3, 2017 The Australian economy continues to perform well in the face of one of the largest terms of trade adjustments in its history. Despite global economic headwinds and the transition underway to broader sources of growth following the mining investment boom, the economy is expected to grow at around trend supported by a flexible exchange rate, adaptive macroeconomic policies and strong institutional arrangements. But challenges remain as Australia experiences some of the symptoms of the ‘new mediocre’, in particular low business investment. The authorities have introduced policies to support business investment and they remain committed to trade, foreign investment and immigration for future economic growth. Recent developments and outlook After 25 years of continuous growth, the economy is forecast to grow in line with potential, at about 2¾ per cent. This is a significant achievement given the challenges associated with adjusting to the size of both the terms of trade boom and subsequent decline and amid weak global growth. The unemployment rate has trended down over recent years to stand at 5.8 per cent, around only half a percentage point or so above the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, while the authorities estimate the output gap to be of a similar magnitude. While GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter 2016, this was heavily influenced by a confluence of one-off factors and the economy is forecast by both the authorities and the IMF to continue to grow in 2017. Over the longer term, the authorities appreciate that productivity growth will be vital for improving living standards in the face of any decline in the terms of trade and modest wages growth. The baseline outlook is for a continued gradual recovery as the economy transitions from a mining investment boom to broader sources of growth. The majority of the decline in mining investment has already occurred, and non-mining investment has begun to grow, albeit slowly. Resource exports are expected to contribute strongly to growth as mining production ramps up following a decade of strong mining investment. Tourism and education service exports are increasing in response to the depreciation in the exchange rate since the peak in the terms of trade in late 2011. Economic activity is also expected to be supported by an increase in public infrastructure investment at both federal and state levels of government. Strong growth in dwelling construction in response to lower interest rates and firm population growth is expected to taper off. Underlying inflation has been running at about 1½ per cent and is forecast to gradually rise over the next 1-2 years. Longer-term inflation expectations appear well anchored. </page>
<page id="63" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">2 Growth in wages appears to have stabilised, although at low rates, and is expected to pick up gradually over the next couple of years, in line with further improvements in the labour market. The authorities largely agree with staff that while the balance of risks has improved, it is still tilted to the downside. A deterioration in the external sector resulting from adverse economic or political developments in larger economies is seen as a particular risk, but not one that the authorities can respond to in a more proactive manner than the policy settings already in place. Domestically, there remains uncertainty about the pace of the pick-up in non-mining business investment. Apparent risks in the housing market are currently manageable. While some segments of the overall market are experiencing rapid price gains, credit growth is not unusually strong, and the Australian household sector as a whole has built significant mortgage buffers. The authorities also agree that there is the potential for a large external shock to interact with, or even trigger, domestic risks. Fiscal Policy The authorities welcome the IMF’s confirmation of the current timetable to return the budget to surplus and note only small differences in path profiles. The average annual pace of fiscal consolidation across the forward estimates is 0.5 per cent of GDP. To the extent that there have been weaker-than-planned budget outcomes over recent years, both             staff and the authorities agree that these have reflected weaker-than-expected nominal growth leading to weaker-than-expected revenue, rather than a policy easing. Expenditure growth has slowed, consistent with the commitment to repair the budget by controlling expenditure. Restraining recurrent spending creates room for productive spending. The authorities have a strong commitment to supporting jobs and growth through boosting infrastructure, innovation and investment while also rebuilding fiscal buffers. The Federal Government is, for example, investing a record $50 billion in national infrastructure, including in the National Broadband Network, the biggest infrastructure project in Australia’s history. State Governments, which have predominant responsibility for infrastructure in Australia, have also increased infrastructure investment. Private investment will be encouraged through a lowering of the corporate tax rate – starting with tax reductions for small businesses – while average wage earners will remain in lower tax brackets longer through adjustments to the personal income tax thresholds. If large downside risks materialize, the authorities will continue to take a flexible approach, prudently supporting the economy while also adhering to a longstanding medium-term fiscal framework of achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the cycle. The flexibility of the economy means that there is less benefit, and more room for error, in trying to ‘fine tune’ the economy through minor adjustments to fiscal settings. The authorities question the Staff’s suggestion that infrastructure investment be used for short- </page>
<page id="64" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">3 term aggregate demand management, given the lags involved. Instead, the focus is on public and private investment in infrastructure to contribute to higher potential growth. The authorities welcome the Staff’s discussion of options for reform of Australia’s fiscal framework and the suggestion that a long-term debt anchor could strengthen the current fiscal framework. Australia has benefited considerably from its longstanding commitment to maintain a budget surplus, on average, over the course of the economic cycle. Australia has also benefited from its regular Intergenerational Reports that assess long-term fiscal sustainability. The Commonwealth Government aims to stabilize and then reduce net debt over time – currently it is expected to peak at about 19 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 before declining to around 10 per cent in 2026-27 – although the uncertainties involved in policymaking mean that care is necessary to avoid policy becoming too constrained by using a rigid debt anchor. Together, the existing tools support a long-term disciplined approach towards fiscal policy that is necessary for a capital importing country which generally runs current account deficits. Monetary Policy Monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The decline in inflation in Australia has been much more recent and much more modest than in other advanced economies and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. As such, while the neutral cash rate has declined somewhat, monetary policy has ensured that finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers, supporting dwelling construction and providing a platform for business investment. The RBA’s flexible inflation- targeting framework ensures that it remains well placed to respond to future developments. The RBA will consider staff’s suggestion of lengthening its forecast horizon in monetary policy statements to help clarify its projections for longer-term inflation. More generally, the RBA will continue to ensure that the public understands its reaction function, allowing them to form their own views on the potential path of interest rates. Financial system The Australian financial system remains in good shape in terms of both its resilience to shocks and its ability to support real economic activity. Resilience has increased over recent years. Banks have improved their capital buffers, with the weighted average CET-1 capital ratios of the four largest Australian banks moving into the upper quartile of international peers on a comparable basis (at about 13.5 per cent as at December 2015). Banks are expected to steadily accumulate further capital as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority continues to finalise its assessment of what constitutes ‘unquestionably strong’ capital positions. The banks have also improved their liquidity profiles by increasing the share of stable funding, including by sourcing more funds from domestic deposits and longer-term debt. Indeed, of those authorized deposit-taking </page>
<page id="65" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">4 institutions that are subject to the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), most already appear to broadly meet the minimum requirements which come into effect in 2018. The banks are working to maintain their profitability through an increased focus on simplifying their businesses and cutting costs, with the major banks’ return on equity currently about 14 per cent. Lending standards will remain under scrutiny given APRA’s intensive and risk-based approach towards supervision. There has been increased attention on reinforcing sound lending standards in response to developments in some segments of the property market. Furthermore, the riskiness of existing housing loans continues to be somewhat mitigated by the sizable mortgage buffers that borrowers have built by maintaining their debt repayments above required repayments as interest rates fell. More generally, the Council of Financial Regulators will continue to monitor potential risks and take additional steps if necessary.1 In this regard, however, the motivation behind the authorities’ actions is to improve the resilience of the economy, not to influence housing prices. They will also continue to carefully monitor commercial property lending and are working to finalize legislation to further improve their crisis management and bank resolution toolkit, in line with the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry accepted by the Government. The structure of Australia’s net external liabilities largely mitigates any potential macro-financial vulnerability. Australia’s current account deficit continues to reflect that Australia’s strong investment outcomes are not able to be fully met by domestic savings. Furthermore, while Australia has a net foreign liability position, it has a net foreign currency asset position, given that the bulk of foreign liabilities are denominated in, or hedged back into, Australian dollars. Indeed, despite the cost, the banking sector not only hedges its foreign currency liabilities but does so in a way that matches the duration of its hedges with the underlying liabilities. Finally, the current account deficit is expected to remain towards the low end of the range in which it has fluctuated over recent decades, and net foreign liabilities have been stable as a share of GDP over the past decade. Structural Reforms The authorities appreciate the importance of further reforms to boost productivity growth. With the terms of trade unlikely to return to its previous highs, improvements in productivity are essential to invigorate growth in living standards. Further reform is also important to create the conditions for stronger private investment as the weakness in non-mining investment is an aspect of the “new mediocre” that is most evident in Australia. 1 The Council of Financial Regulators is the coordinating body for Australia’s main financial regulatory agencies. It comprises the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, and The Treasury </page>
<page id="66" bbox="0.000,0.000,612.000,792.000" rotate="0">5 The authorities welcome Staff’s message that the reform agenda is appropriately focused on fostering innovation and competition. The National Innovation and Science Agenda will play a key role in supporting investment, innovation and enterprise, with its effectiveness underpinned by annual assessments. The first tranche included changing funding arrangements for some government services; the second tranche may focus on improving critical science capabilities and business investment in innovation. With regards to taxation reform, this was the focus of comprehensive analysis and national debate in 2015 and 2016, the outcome of which was a focus on lowering the corporate tax rate and adjustments to personal income tax brackets to ensure average wage earners remain in lower tax brackets for longer. Heightened competition will be supported by the implementation of recommendations from the Harper Review into competition policy, including introducing competition, contestability and consumer choice in the provision of (largely publicly provided) human services. The Government has also initiated specific inquiries into the efficiency of the superannuation industry as well as competition in the financial system. This is on top of the changes to the financial system coming out of the Government accepting all but one of the recommendations from the Financial System Inquiry. More broadly, the Productivity Commission has been tasked with undertaking regular reviews of the nation’s productivity performance. <TouchUp_TextEdit>Australia remains firmly committed to an open economy in trade, foreign investment and immigration. Australian policymakers understand that it is in Australia’s national interest to stay the course and continue liberalizing trade. Australia remains well placed to benefit from its diversification and integration into Asia, and continues to benefit from recent FTAs with China, Japan and South Korea. In addition, Australia is developing new multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements with major trading partners. </page>
