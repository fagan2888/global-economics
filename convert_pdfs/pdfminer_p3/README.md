This folder contains different examples of scripts and possible outputs trying to convert .pdf files into .html (to come: .xml or .tag formats)

Those examples use already downloaded pdfs from 'pdfs-downloaded' folder - find them in 'scrape_articles'

The multiprosessing is set up: each file is given 180 seconds to be converted. After that, the script terminates the conversion of current file and moves to the next one.

The outputs are printed to the terminal - in case the conversion didn't finish, the line "Done with converting "name_of_document.pdf" is not printed.

At this stage, from 23 files that were attemted to be converted for testing purposes '-doc-cr1719.pdf',' and  -doc-cr1723.pdf' did not convert.
