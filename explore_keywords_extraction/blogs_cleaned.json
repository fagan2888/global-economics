In our April 2017 _[Fiscal Monitor_, we show that countries can raise productivity by improving the design of their tax system, which includes both policies and administration. This would allow business reasons, not tax ones, to drive firms' investment and employment decisions. Countries can substantially increase productivity by eliminating barriers that hold more productive firms back. These barriers include badly designed economic policies, or markets that do not function as they should. We estimate that eliminating such barriers would, on average across countries, lift annual real GDP growth rates by roughly 1 percentage point over 20 years. We also find that emerging market and low-income countries can achieve one quarter of these gains by improving the design of their tax policies and revenue administrations. **Doing more with the same** Countries can increase productivity by tackling the barriers that give rise to poor use of existing resources within countries'resource misallocation. Such barriers prevent productive firms from expanding and allow unproductive ones to survive. When comparing a less efficient country with another closer to the world's productivity frontier, the contrast is stark. As the figure below illustrates, the less efficient country does have several highly productive firms. The main difference stems from the fact that the less efficient country has many more unproductive firms. [ How can a better allocation of resources across firms raise productivity? Imagine two firms that produce software, with identical technologies but different behavior towards taxation. Because of a weak tax administration, one firm avoids detection by the tax authority and doesn't pay taxes, therefore facing a lower user cost of capital. The other firm is tax-compliant due to greater scrutiny from the tax authority, therefore facing a higher user cost of capital. The difference in user cost means that the tax-evading firm can afford to undertake investments in lower-return projects, while the fully taxed firm can only undertake investments in higher-return projects. In this example, aggregate output would be higher if capital were to move from the untaxed firm to the fully taxed firm, allowing for more investment in higher- return projects. **How governments tax matters for productivity** What drives the misallocation of resources? Misallocation arises when government policies or poorly functioning markets favor some firms over others. Examples include tax incentives that depend on firm size or type of investment, weak tax enforcement, tariffs applied to particular goods, product market regulations that limit market access, preferential loans granted to specific firms, and financial markets that are not fully developed. Tackling all these policies and practices is very complex. The _Fiscal Monitor_ explores a selection of tax policies that discriminate against firms in different ways, giving rise to resource misallocation. In this blog, we focus on one: tax evasion. This example is especially relevant for emerging market and low-income developing countries. It illustrates clearly that a weak tax administration not only hurts revenue collection, but it also hurts productivity. Through tax evasion, 'cheats'\u009d'by which we refer to firms that are registered with the tax authority but underreport their sales for tax purposes'enjoy a potentially large implicit subsidy that allows them to stay in business despite low productivity. As a result, 'cheats'\u009d gain market share even if they are less productive, reducing the market share of more productive, tax compliant businesses. Our empirical results show that a stronger tax administration reduces the prevalence of cheats. By getting rid of the implicit subsidy, the less productive 'cheats'\u009d, unable to compete, will go out of business. This makes room for productive, tax-compliant firms to gain market share and absorb greater amounts of labor and capital, raising aggregate productivity. Our estimates show that in emerging market and low income developing countries, closing the productivity gap between tax compliant firms and cheats would add \u00c2? to 1 percentage points to aggregate productivity. All countries have much to gain from removing the policies and practices that prevent resources from going to where they are most productive. Upgrading the tax system can play an important part.

[Chapter 3 of the April 2017 _[World Economic Outlook _finds that this trend is driven by rapid progress in technology and global integration. Labor's share of income declines when wages grow more slowly than productivity, or the amount of output per hour of work. The result is that a growing fraction of productivity gains has been going to capital. And since capital tends to be concentrated in the upper ends of the income distribution,[ falling labor income shares are likely to raise income inequality. **Trending down** In advanced economies, labor income shares began trending down in the 1980s. They reached their lowest level of the past half century just prior to the global financial crisis of 2008, and have not recovered materially since. Labor income shares now are almost 4 percentage points lower than they were in 1970. Despite more limited data, labor shares have also declined in emerging market and developing economies since the early 1990s. This is especially the case for the larger economies in this group. In China, for example, despite impressive gains in poverty reduction over the past two decades, labor shares still fell by almost 3 percentage points. Indeed, as growth remains subpar in many countries, an increasing recognition that the gains from growth have not been broadly shared has strengthened a backlash against economic integration and bolstered support in favor of inward-looking policies. This is especially the case in several advanced economies. Our[ study takes an in-depth look at the symptoms and drivers of this downward trend in labor share of income. **Technology: a key driver in advanced economies** In advanced economies, about **_half_** of the decline in labor shares can be traced to the impact of technology. The decline was driven by a combination of rapid progress in information and telecommunication technology, and a high share of occupations that could be easily be automated. Global integration'as captured by trends in final goods trade, participation in global value chains, and foreign direct investment'also played a role. Its contribution is estimated at about **_half that of technology_**. Because participation in global value chains typically implies offshoring of labor- intensive tasks, the effect of integration is to lower labor shares in tradable sectors. Admittedly, it is difficult to cleanly separate the impact of technology from global integration, or from policies and reforms. Yet the results for advanced economies is compelling. Taken together, technology and global integration explain close to 75 percent of the decline in labor shares in Germany and Italy, and close to 50 percent in the United States. **Global integration: largely benign in emerging market economies** In emerging markets and developing economies, global integration has allowed for expanded access to capital and technology and, by raising productivity and growth, has led to a rise in living standards and lifted millions from poverty. However, these forces may also be associated with declining labor income shares, by shifting the production in emerging market and developing economies towards more capital-intensive activities. We find that global integration, and more specifically participation in global value chains, was the key driver of declines in labor shares in emerging markets. This effect could, however, be interpreted as benign: it is the result of capital deepening that is not necessarily accompanied by dislocation of employment or reduction in wages. In Turkey, for example, the decline in labor income share of around 5 percentage points is explained almost exclusively by the rapid rise in participation in global value chains. Technology, in contrast, has played a small role in these economies. This reflects a smaller decline in the relative price of investment goods as well as a lower share of automatable jobs. **Hollowing out of the middle-skilled labor share** Another key finding of our research is that the decline in labor shares in advanced economies has been particularly sharp for middle-skilled labor. Routine-biased technology has taken over many of the tasks performed by these workers, contributing to job polarization toward high-skilled and low-skilled occupations. This 'hollowing-out'\u009d phenomenon has been reinforced by global integration, as firms in advanced economies increasingly have access to a global labor supply through cross-border value chains. **Dealing with disruption** We conclude that although technological advancement and global economic integration have been key drivers of global prosperity, their effects on labor shares challenge policymakers to find ways to spread those benefits more broadly. The design of specific policy responses, of course, will have to depend on country circumstances and be anchored in their social contracts. In Part 2 of this blog, we will discuss our findings on the skill and sectoral trends in labor income shares as well as possible policy responses. We also elaborate on a new cross-country index to measure the share of occupations that are at risk of being automated. Stay tuned!

The beverage beside you could well be tea grown in Sri Lanka or Kenya. And there is a chance that you are 'or soon will be'on a plane headed for Shanghai, Sao Paulo, or St. Petersburg. The list could go on. But even from a few examples around us, it is easy to detect the pervasive role of emerging market and developing economies in the global economy these days'a role that has grown more important over time. Improved policy frameworks and structural reforms in emerging market and developing economies over the past twenty years have been crucial for this transformation. But as our research in [Chapter 2 of the April 2017 _[World Economic Outlook_ shows, the external environment has also played its part in facilitating their rise. These economies now face a possibly more complicated external environment than they have grown accustomed to in recent decades. Nevertheless, they can still enhance the growth impulse from less supportive external conditions with the right policy mix and by continuing to strengthen their institutional frameworks. **Role of external conditions ** Emerging market and developing economies now account for close to 80 percent of global economic growth, almost double their share from two decades ago. Their relevance for the global economy isn't simply as centers of production or trading hubs packaging and shipping goods to advanced economies. They have also become increasingly important as final destinations for consumer goods and services, now accounting for close to 85 percent of the growth in global consumption, more than double their share in the 1990s. These economies have become more integrated into the global trading system and international capital markets since the 1990s. And as this process has unfolded, the relative prices of their exports and imports, external demand, and, in particular, external financial conditions, have increasingly influenced their growth in real income per capita. Our [study finds, for instance, that about one third of the 1\u00c2? percentage points pickup in the average growth rate of income per capita since 2005, relative to the 1995-2004 period, can be attributed to stronger capital inflows. Over time, demand for exports from other emerging market and developing economies has also exerted a more powerful force on these economies' medium-term growth. Beyond the numbers, the influence of the external environment has extended to the nature of their growth process. Several of these economies have experienced episodes of growth accelerations and reversals with sustained changes in growth rates. These episodes appear to have a long-lasting effect on the level of income per capita. The chapter finds that favorable external conditions increase the likelihood of growth accelerations and lower that of reversals. **Growth in a more complicated external environment** Emerging market and developing economies enjoyed exceptionally favorable external conditions over long stretches of the post-2000 period'strong external demand, relatively abundant capital inflows, and an upswing in commodity prices. Over the past few years, however, the external environment has become more complicated for these economies. The slow recovery from the crisis in advanced economies has weakened demand for emerging market and developing economy exports. China has relied less on commodity imports as it rebalances its economy toward consumption and services. And the commodity cycle, more broadly, has turned since 2014, reducing growth rates among commodity exporters. Some of these shifts in the external environment may persist. Additional elements in the mix are a risk of protectionism in advanced economies, and a general tightening of external financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes. Emerging market and developing economies are therefore likely to experience a weaker growth impulse from external conditions than in the past. **Room for convergence ** Despite this more complicated environment, the chapter's analysis finds that these economies can still get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks, protecting trade integration, permitting exchange rate flexibility, and containing vulnerabilities from high current account deficits and large public debts. Some of these policies can also directly help boost growth in emerging market and developing economies, regardless of the shift in external conditions. After all, with 90 percent of the group at levels of income per capita less than half that in the United States, there is still considerable room for catch-up growth and convergence.

Japan offers an example of the impact on banks, and our analysis suggests that there could also be far-reaching consequences for insurance companies, pension funds, and asset-management firms. You might argue that this scenario of economic malaise has already materialized; after all, interest rates and economic growth have been low since the financial crisis in 2008. The question is whether the post-crisis landscape represents a temporary departure from the pace of growth we've come to expect since World War II, or whether it's the start of a new normal. Notwithstanding the recent increase in long-term yields in some advanced economies, the Japanese experience suggests that we cannot be sure whether an exit from a low-growth/low interest rate trap is imminent or permanent. **Depressed margins** [Chapter 2 of the IMF's [_Global Financial Stability Report_ examines the likely impact of an extended period of stagnation. Some of the fallout is already apparent. The so-called yield curve, or the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, has flattened. For banks, which generally borrow money relatively cheaply for short periods and lend for longer periods at higher rates, that means less revenue. Banks typically also find it difficult to lower rates on deposits to below zero, so that lower rates tend to depress margins. And with a likely decline in demand for credit from households as the population ages and growth remains slow, higher lending volumes can't compensate for low margins. By contrast, demand for fees-based and transactional services can be expected to rise. [ Here's a closer look at a scenario of long-term stagnation: * **Smaller, deposit-funded and less diversified banks **will be hurt most in such a scenario. They may be pushed to reduce costs to preserve profits, and ultimately into mergers or bankruptcy. * **Larger banks** are likely to diversify abroad as they seek new, more profitable outlets in emerging markets. * **Life insurance companies **also face threats to their profits and solvency. Their assets, or investments such as bonds, are often shorter-term than their liabilities, or the policies they write. That means they may have to reinvest maturing assets at lower yields, while continuing to make high payouts on their policies. As a result, they may be forced to raise more capital. * **Pension funds**, like life-insurance companies, may need more capital. They would also have to reduce benefits in the long term. The transition from defined-benefit to defined payment pension plans continues. * **Asset managers** see their market share grow as more people invest retirement savings in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. They may also grab business from insurance companies as savers seek alternatives to lower-yielding guaranteed products such as whole-life policies. [ How should **policymakers and regulators** respond to these shifts in the financial landscape? Here are some general principles: * Make it easier to consolidate or liquidate failing firms, allowing remaining banks to improve their profitability * Limit incentives for banks to take on excessive financial risk * Introduce frameworks that recognize the financial conditions of insurance companies and pension funds by consistently evaluating assets and liabilities based on economic value, if they haven't yet done so. In addition, asset management firms may need closer supervision as their its share of the financial system continues to grow. In particular, regulators may need to monitor threats to financial stability posed by the increasing popularity of passive index-linked funds, which may reduce diversity of investments and encourage herd behavior among fund managers.

For policymakers around the world, the question is more than academic. Their concern: Global events have such a large impact on financial markets that there's little scope left to pursue their own objectives, such as full employment or low inflation. **Unwelcome development** Here's a simple example of why that's the case. A decision by the Fed to raise interest rates increases yields on US assets, attracting capital from other countries. As a result, interest rates in those countries may go up, making it harder for consumers and companies to obtain the credit they need to buy more goods or invest in new machinery. That could be an unwelcome development in a country that is trying to keep borrowing costs low to combat unemployment, for example, or sustain economic growth. To find out how much freedom central banks still have to pursue their own policy objectives, [the latest IMF [_Global Financial Stability Report_ develops indexes that measure changes in financial conditions in a broad array of advanced and developing economies. Financial conditions refer to how easy or difficult it is to borrow money, and they can be influenced by bond prices and exchange rates. A measure of those conditions is a useful tool for assessing the likely impact of policy decisions. **Financial shocks** Our indexes show that global events account for between 20 percent and 40 percent of local conditions across countries, leaving policymakers considerable scope for action. And even as financial markets have become more integrated, the degree of control countries exert over domestic conditions has only diminished mildly over the past two decades. Still, the rapid speed and the strength by which external financial shocks tend to affect local markets often makes it difficult for policymakers to react in a timely and effective manner. Global conditions appear to be strongly driven by the United States, in part because the dollar is the predominant currency in international transactions. We found that the global financial conditions index correlates strongly with those in the United States and with the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, a gauge of perceived risk in US equities. Emerging markets, which are more sensitive to global conditions than advanced economies, should take steps to bolster their resilience to global shocks. They should deepen domestic financial markets and develop a local investor base, making their markets less susceptible to fluctuations in flows of money across borders. Such steps are particularly important now, when financial conditions are tightening in response to the Fed's rate hike.

(Chinese) Services, which already account for 50 percent of world income and 70 percent of employment, are also becoming an important part of international trade. Services exports'accounting for nearly one fourth of total exports'have come to play a central role in the global economy, thanks in large part to advances in technology. Rapidly declining telecommunication costs, increasing internet adoption around the world, and proliferation of broadband internet services have made it possible to deliver services across long distances. While a haircut still requires a trip to the local barbershop, many other services, such as insurance or medical diagnoses, no longer require the provider to be close to the customer. In our new [paper, we track this development with a rich detailed dataset on global trade in services. We make the case that such virtual trade in services are not only catching up with exports of goods in many countries, but it can offer opportunities for new sources of growth, that could help raise productivity and jobs, especially in emerging and developing economies. [ **New source of growth for developing economies** Since many countries can take advantage of these technological advances, the rise in services exports is not confined to advanced economies. Services exports from developing countries have grown tenfold since 1990, and at twice the rate of services exports from advanced economies; hence, developing countries' share has increased from 3 percent in 1970 to almost 20 percent in 2014. This increase is not just due to higher exports of traditional services, such as travel and transport, but is also due to modern technology-enabled services as well, such as business services (including research and development, and consultancy), computer and information services, financial services, and intellectual property. Recent [evidence shows that services seem to experience productivity growth through the same mechanisms that traditionally have made manufacturing the key driver of growth. Technology allows for services to be increasingly unbundled: a single service activity can now be fragmented into tasks that are done at different geographic locations, such as business process outsourcing and online banking services. As with goods, services productivity can rise because of specialization (a finer division of labor) and scale (falling unit costs of production). **New data set to track services exports** While it may be too early to tell definitively if the drivers of growth are indeed moving from manufacturing into services, the rise in services exports is an important development to track. Our [paper contributes to this effort by introducing a new dataset on global trade in services for 192 countries from 1970 to 2014. We use information from the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics database to track developments in 66 services exports subsectors. A [web portal provides access to the data and tools to produce charts and stylized facts. Using this rich data, we document the global trends in services exports and how countries differ on various dimensions of services exports. At the global level, computer and information services and financial services have emerged as two of the most important sectors in the services exports basket. In 2014, world exports of computer and information services reached $300 billion, 10 percent of the total. Similarly, exports of financial services have grown rapidly, and have bounced back since the Global Recession to reach almost $350 billion in 2014. The chart below presents the share of selected countries in world services exports in 1990 and 2014. The United States has remained the top services exporter, though its importance has declined significantly. Though well known as an exporter of goods, China has also become an important services exporter (ranked fifth in 2014). India, well known for its exports of business process outsourcing and support services for finance and medicine, is also now one of the top 10 countries, with its share of services exports tripling to over 3 percent of world service exports during the period 2000'13. Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia, and Egypt are in the top 30 and moving up rapidly. [ **Implications for growth strategies** Our dataset can be used by researchers and policymakers to study the growing importance of modern services in the global economy and the role of services exports in the process of structural transformation. Traditional services such as transport, travel or retail still require physical presence; however, they too are gaining from being an integral part of [global value chains, and increased tradability due to significantly lower costs enabled by breakthrough technologies, including in fuel efficiency. In addition, the shift to export of modern services has spread across countries at different income levels, making them one of the fastest growing segments of world trade. [ Many emerging markets, including China and India, are seeking [service-led sources of growth. Service-led growth also offers opportunities for diversification and competitiveness for countries across the development spectrum, particularly to resource-rich and low-income countries. Services now contribute significantly to the productivity of many manufacturing industries'countries need services to develop their manufacturing sectors such as using information and communications technology services to improve production efficiency and lower production cost. Trade in services offers opportunities for labor reallocation and job creation, and could help address the growing polarization of labor markets. Preliminary evidence suggests that on average, countries that experience higher growth in services exports also experience faster job growth. Services trade has also been more resilient than trade in goods to shocks and financial crisis, and services exports from developing countries have been generally more resilient than those from advanced economies. **A global win-win** These glimpses from our dataset suggest that export of services may be a game- changer, offering an opportunity to sustain global economic integration. For advanced economies, trade in very high-tech services could help them retain some global competitive edge. At the same time, the growing tradability of services can aid the diversification strategy of resource-rich countries and low-income countries. And for many countries, services may offer a pathway to inclusive growth, for instance by offering work opportunities for women.

Even before the global financial crisis, productivity growth showed signs of slowing in many advanced economies. But in the aftermath of the crisis, there was a further, abrupt deceleration. Unlike normal economic slowdowns, deep recessions leave [long-lasting scars on total factor productivity, as this chart shows. The global financial crisis was no different.

In this [podcast, he says that the labor market works much like any other market, driven by supply and demand, and the latter is very dependent on how well the economy is doing. 'On the demand side, the labor markets globally haven't fully recovered from the Great Recession after the [U.S. investment bank] Lehman Brothers crash in 2008. We still have 200 million people unemployed. We still have very sluggish growth. On the income side, what we've seen globally, but particularly in certain countries, is a generalized rise to greater inequality of labor incomes in the last 30 to 35 years.'\u009d Is this only a problem for developing countries? 'I think it affects everyone,'\u009d says Evans. 'The Gini coefficient increased very significantly in some of the industrialized countries. The post-World War II years was a period of falling income inequality, whereas now we've seen a jump back to some of the levels that existed in the 1920s.'\u009d Evans says the IMF's [analysis of advanced economies shows that half the increase in inequality between the top decile and bottom decile is due to weaker unions and declining unionization. As such, there's a strong case for advocating more broadly-based inclusive growth, which is what most institutions now say is their key policy. 'Sixty percent of people globally work outside formal employment. So, how the labor market institutions re-attach them to the labor force is crucially important.'\u009d While technology is transforming the labor force, Evans says technology will have less impact in the short term on increasing jobs, but more impact on the quality of work, and potentially on income distribution. 'If we look at past waves of technological change in different countries'trying to make sure workers have new skills, that there are policies to help them move to new jobs, and that they have a sense of security and protection in that change process'it's sometimes been managed well, and sometimes badly.

But, central bank reserve managers have been losing sleep over two main issues: low interest rates, and how best to communicate the choices they make. Central banks' reserve managers decide on how to invest central banks' international reserves, what to invest in, and when. The overarching investment objective is to help preserve the external value of the domestic currency. They base this objective on three main pillars: preserving the capital of the investments, ensuring the liquidity of assets'how tradable they are'and earning a return. Even though many countries' economies are recovering after the global financial crisis, many reserve managers are still fretting. We wanted to know why. So we asked 63 central banks from advanced, emerging, and low-income countries about the reasons behind their worries. Their answers revealed a lot and were quite similar. We pulled together the results and here are the top two things reserve managers worry about. **Low interest rates** Low interest rates are their main concern, as you can see in the figure below. Returns on central banks' international reserves are low, and in some cases even turned negative. Reserve managers are struggling to find sources of income without taking unacceptable risks. Before the global financial crisis, even safe and liquid assets'such as government bonds'enabled generally good returns, and the three pillars underlying the investment objective could be relatively easily achieved. This is no longer the case. [ Reserve managers have had to find new solutions, but face higher risks if they want to increase returns. Some of them have tried to invest in currencies that will give them a higher rate of return on their investment, but with the increase in the volatility of foreign exchange markets, they have swapped one concern for another'lower returns for currency risk. The choices are difficult: what risks to take, how, and whether the newly employed solutions will deliver the desired results. For example, investing in emerging market or corporate bonds may bring in more money in the short run, but may not provide a steady stream of investment income. **Communicating choices** Asset managers have started to communicate their choices more, but it remains hard for many central banks to convey the choices they make, and why. The chart below shows the majority of central banks we surveyed do not publish their reserve management guidelines. Clear and consistent communication about reserve management practices and choices helps financial markets and the public understand why reserve managers make the choices they do. This means explaining that managing international reserves is not about making a profit. Ultimately, it is about preserving the external value of the domestic currency and putting stability first. [ So how do reserve managers strike a balance? Most of them focused on the first two pillars'capital preservation and a high level of liquidity of their reserves'at the expense of the return on their investments. Central banks' stakeholders should support this strategy, especially in times of increased financial volatility and low interest rates.

The [IMF's Global House Price Index'an average of real house prices across countries'has been rising for the past four years. However, house prices are not rising in every country. As noted in our [November 2016 Quarterly Update, house price developments in the countries that make up the index fall into three clusters: **gloom**, **bust and boom**, and **boom**. The first cluster'**gloom**'consists of countries in which house prices fell substantially at the onset of the Great Recession, and have remained on a downward path. The second cluster'**bust and boom**'consists of countries in which housing markets have rebounded since 2013 after falling sharply during 2007'12. The third cluster'**boom**'consists of countries in which the drop in house prices in 2007'12 was quite modest, and was followed by a quick rebound. This chart shows that house prices varies within a cluster and within a country. Recent IMF assessments provide a more nuanced view of the within- country house price developments. [ For example, in [Australia, the strongest house price increases continue to be recorded in Sydney and Melbourne, where underlying demand for housing remains strong. In [Austria, the cumulative increase in the house price index over 2007'2015 was nearly 40 percent. To a large extent, this increase was driven by price dynamics in Vienna. Looking at [Turkey, the housing market exhibits significant variations across cities. Regional variations have been further accentuated by the presence of almost 3 million Syrian refugees since March 2011. Cities near the Syrian border, which have absorbed larger masses of Syrian refugees, have seen significant rises in local housing prices since 2011, though they have moderated in recent years. ## Country/region and city clusters ", "index": 11}, {"pub": "3/24/2017", "title": "Make Women a Priority", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=17794", "content": " By [IMFBlog Women the world over often find themselves on the bottom rung of the employment ladder looking up.

On the contrary, it remains more necessary than ever, as does international cooperation to ensure the safety and resilience of global capital markets. That is why the Group of Twenty (G20) finance ministers and central bank governors reiterated their support for continuing financial-sector reform at their meeting in Baden-Baden [last week. The 2008 global financial crisis was exceptionally severe in the magnitude, breadth, and persistence of its effects, but it is one in a long series of financial crises stretching back centuries. Not only do crises cause financial losses for professional investors; more importantly, they impose high human costs for those who lose their jobs, homes, and savings. To protect their citizens, governments generally adopt an array of financial regulations designed to reduce the risk of a failure that could reverberate across the economy. These include balance-sheet standards, insider trading rules, broader conflict-of-interest laws, and consumer protections. **Too far? ** Some argue that such existing regulations go too far and mostly hurt the economy by reducing financial institutions' profits and thereby their ability to provide essential services. They claim that banks and other financial institutions'acting in their shareholders' interest'would not knowingly risk failure; even if they avoid insolvency, the damage to their reputations would put them out of business. Yet history abounds with examples of reckless behavior, ranging from the [Dutch Tulip Mania of the seventeenth century to the [subprime lending boom of the 2000s. And even when a financial firm's managers soberly assess their own personal risks, they still may not be prudent enough from society's perspective, because some costs of failure fall on others, such as their shareholders and the taxpayers who must ultimately pay if there is a government bailout. But the task of financial-sector oversight, never easy, has become more complex over the past 50 years as financial activity increasingly crosses national boundaries. That is why national governments have stepped up collaboration to promote stability and create a level playing field in international financial markets. The global scope of modern finance creates at least four major complications for national regulators and supervisors. First, it is hard to assess the operations of financial institutions that extend beyond their home countries. Second, financial firms may take advantage of regulatory differences among countries to place their riskiest activities in lightly-regulated locations. Third, complex institutions with operations spanning several national jurisdictions are harder to wind down if they fail. And fourth, countries might actively compete for international financial business while also supporting their national 'champions'\u009d through lax regulatory standards. All of these factors undermine the stability of the global financial system, especially as financial instruments and networks become more complex. **Forums for international cooperation** To address these challenges, national regulators launched in 1974 a process of consultation and coordination under the aegis of the [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Committee focuses on banking regulation, whereas the [Financial Stability Board, set up by the G20 after the financial crisis of 2008, coordinates the development of regulatory policies across the broader international financial markets, bringing together national authorities, international financial institutions, and sectoral standards setters. Governments cooperate through the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board because no single national authority, acting by itself, can guarantee the stability of its own financial system when banks and other financial institutions operate globally. International agreements on regulatory and supervisory standards discourage a race to the bottom by establishing a level global playing field for financial industry competition. More generally, when countries compete for business through excessive deregulation, all end up worse off because financial accidents become more likely, and, when they happen, are more severe and more likely to propagate across borders. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, the Basel Committee undertook a major initiative, known as the Basel III accord, which includes higher minimum standards for both the quality and quantity of bank capital (the equity cushion that allows banks to absorb losses without going bankrupt and needing government support). While sufficient bank capital is vital, even higher capital levels could be threatened in a severe panic, so the accord includes additional measures to reduce banking risk. As a result, even though Basel III is still being phased in globally, banks are already much better capitalized and less vulnerable to market jitters than they were a decade ago. The United States, which made banks recapitalize and restructure more aggressively after the crisis, recovered more quickly than countries that did not. But a safe global financial system needs more than balance-sheet constraints for banks. In parallel with the development of the Basel III standards, the Financial Stability Board created a common approach to handling the failure of the largest and most systemic financial institutions. It is critical that insolvent institutions can be wound down safely, even when they are big, international, complex, or otherwise would pose a threat to the broader financial system in case of failure. If they cannot, government bailouts are more likely, risk-taking is excessive, and market discipline is subverted. Of course, financial regulation involves tradeoffs. In principle, requiring more capital and liquidity can raise the cost of credit for households and businesses or reduce market liquidity. So far, research studies indicate that any unintended consequences are relatively small. Yet the benefits of a safer financial system are unquestionably large. Although the financial system is safer today, it is also true that financial regulations have become much more complex. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act is more than a thousand pages long and has generated tens of thousands of pages of follow-up implementation rules. There is certainly room for simplification. For example, the threshold for designating banks as systemic and hence subject to enhanced regulatory standards, currently set at a balance-sheet size of $50 billion, might be made more flexible. Regulation of community banks could also be simplified without making the system riskier, as could the implementation of stress tests, which aim to assess banks' resilience to potential economic and financial shocks. At the same time, the core tenets of the new global regulatory regime must be preserved. Paradoxically, the relative resilience of financial markets in recent years, which is partly the result of more stringent internationally agreed standards, has itself been cited to argue that financial regulation is an excessive drag on growth. This view is shortsighted. As [Hyman Minsky, a well-known writer on financial crises, put it, 'success breeds a disregard of the possibility of failure'\u00a6'\u009d In other words, policymakers should not be lulled into forgetting the hard lessons of the not-so-distant past. Continuing international financial cooperation remains essential'it is the solid foundation of a strong and stable world economy.

The financial world is no exception. As a result, the financial world stands at a critical juncture. Yes, the widespread adoption of new technologies, such as blockchain-based systems, offers many potential benefits. But it also gives rise to new risks, including risks to financial stability. That causes challenges for financial regulators, a subject I addressed at the 2017 World Government Summit in Dubai. For example, we need to define the legal status of a virtual currency, or digital token. We need to combat money laundering and terrorist financing by figuring out how best to perform customer due diligence on virtual currency transfers. Fintech also has macroeconomic implications that need to be better understood as we develop policies to help the Fund's member countries navigate this rapidly changing environment. **Soaring investment** Financial technology, or fintech'a term that encompasses products, developers and operators of alternative financial systems'is challenging traditional business models. And it is growing rapidly. According to one recent estimate, fintech investment quadrupled from 2010 to 2015, to $19 billion annually. Fintech innovation has come in many shapes and forms'from peer-to-peer lending, to high-frequency trading, to big data and robotics. There are many success stories. Think of cell phone-based banking in Kenya and China, which is bringing millions of people'previously 'unbanked'\u009d'into the mainstream financial system. Think of the virtual currency exchanges that allow people in developing countries to transfer money across borders quickly and cheaply. All this calls for more creative thinking. How exactly will these technologies change the financial world? Will they completely transform it? Will banks be replaced by blockchain-based systems that facilitate peer-to-peer transactions? Will artificial intelligence reduce the need for trained professionals? And if so, can smart machines provide better financial advice to investors? The truth is: we do not know yet. Significant investment is going into fintech, but most of its real-world applications are still being tested. **Regulatory challenges** And the regulatory challenges are just emerging. For instance, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be used to make anonymous cross-border transfers'which increases the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Another risk'over the medium term'is the potential impact on financial stability brought about by the entry of new types of financial services providers into the market. Questions abound. Should new technologies'often driven by algorithms'be subject to the same type of regulation used in the past? Or are new regulatory approaches needed for evolving technologies? Can the forces of innovation help reduce risks and maximize benefits? Some jurisdictions are taking a creative and far-sighted approach to regulation'by establishing 'fintech sandboxes,'\u009d such as the 'Regulatory Laboratory'\u009d in Abu Dhabi and the 'Fintech Supervisory Sandbox'\u009d in Hong Kong. These initiatives are designed to promote innovation by allowing new technologies to be developed and tested in a closely supervised environment. Here at the IMF, we are closely monitoring fintech developments. Last year, we published a [paper on virtual currencies, focusing on the regulatory, financial, and monetary implications. We have since broadened our focus to cover blockchain applications more generally. And we have recently established a [High-level Advisory Panel of Leaders in Fintech to help us understand developments in the field. We expect to publish a new study on fintech in May. As I see it, all this amounts to a 'brave new world'\u009d for the financial sector. For some, a brave new world means a frightening vision of the future'much like the world described in Aldous Huxley's famous novel. But one could also think of Shakespeare's evocation of this brave new world in _The Tempest_: '_O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!

These downward trends can have potentially large and complex social implications, including a rise in income inequality. This chart shows that advanced economies that experienced a larger decline in their price of investment goods (such as computers, and other information and communications technologies), relative to consumption goods, saw a larger decline in their labor share of income. Declines in the relative price of investment goods across countries were, to a large extent, driven by rapid advances in technology. But these declines varied across countries depending on their investment and consumption patterns, including their reliance on commodity trade. [ For example, the decline was larger in countries with a higher share of machinery and equipment in their overall investment (e.g., US and Germany), while it was smaller in countries reliant on service industries, particularly tourism and finance, such as Cyprus, Belgium, and Sweden, or on commodity exports, such as Canada and Norway. A larger decline in the relative price of investment goods in turn, presented firms with stronger incentives to replace jobs with machines, more so in countries and sectors with a higher share of so-called 'routine'\u009d occupations, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The chapter also looks at strategies policymakers can consider to support displaced labor. Some policies may be temporary in nature, for instance unemployment benefits, or active labor market policies, such as job training or subsidies. However, policymakers need to also consider policies of a longer-lasting duration, including retooling of income policies and tax systems. Further, redesign of education and training policies to prepare people for rapid technological changes will be key.

'The German finance ministry realizes that if we do not invest heavily now in the education, employment and empowerment of this generation of Africans, the international community'above all'European neighbors to Africa, will profoundly regret it.'\u009d Drummond says there have been several moments in recent history when the world has come together in response to what's both the opportunity and jeopardy of the situation of the continent, but it's unclear which one of those situations is going to win.

The result was a steep decline in price. Two years later, on November 30, 2016, the organization took a different tack and committed to a six-month, 1.2 million barrel a day (3.5 percent) reduction in OPEC crude oil output to 32.5 million barrels per day, effective in January 2017. The result was a small price increase and some price stability. But the respite may be temporary, because the price increase is likely to stimulate other oil production that can come on line quickly. A recent sharp decline in prices because of higher than expected oil inventories in the United States underlines the temporary nature of the respite the OPEC agreement provides. **The OPEC agreement** Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait are bearing the brunt of the OPEC cuts, which could be extended another six months, while some member countries such as Nigeria and Libya have been exempted. Moreover, non- OPEC producers joined in and agreed to cut about 600,000 barrels a day. Russia committed to cut 300,000 barrels, and 10 other non-OPEC oil producing countries agreed to cut the remaining 300,00 barrels a day. [ These agreements appear to have brought supply and demand into balance at a price just above $50 a barrel'largely because of the high degree of compliance by OPEC members with the level of production agreed to last November. OPEC reported that compliance was close to 90 percent in January'a level that would be in sharp contrast with the typically low adherence by OPEC members to those set in earlier production agreements. There are some reports that compliance is lower, but Saudi Arabia has signaled it will do whatever it takes to enhance the credibility of the agreement and has cut its production more than required. That said, there are several threats to the effectiveness of the agreement, even in the short term. Some OPEC members'Iraq, Libya, and Nigeria'have increased their production since October. Furthermore, not only did non-OPEC producers make smaller reductions than OPEC, they also do not have to reach their production targets as soon. For example, Russia has so far cut only 120,000 of the 300,000 barrels a day it promised. And some analysts believe that some of the targeted reductions are phantom, reflecting a natural decline from historically high production levels rather than active cuts. **Shale oil threat** But perhaps the biggest threat to the attempt to achieve price stability comes from shale oil producers. The $6-a-barrel increase in spot oil prices that followed the hints last September of an OPEC production agreement is expected to stimulate investment in oil production in 2017, after significant declines in the previous two years. An increase in shale oil output in the United States could quickly offset much or all of the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts, because shale wells can begin production within a year of the initial investment, unlike conventional oil investments, which take a number of years to come to fruition. The shale effect has happened before. In early 2014, even though excess supply was building up, oil prices remained at around $100 a barrel because market participants expected OPEC to cut production to support prices'creating a floor price that stimulated non-OPEC production of not only shale oil, but oil from relatively high-cost sources as well. The floor price did not last long because oversupply built up'and oil prices began to fall, precipitously after the OPEC meeting in November 2014. Despite OPEC's greater ability to sustain the recent production agreement, a somewhat similar sequence of events is likely to occur now because of shale oil's fast responsiveness to price changes. US shale oil investment declined very sharply following the drop in oil prices that started in 2014 and within a few months, production declined. The oil price rebound in 2016 helped boost investment, which was further enhanced by the announcement in September 2016 in Algeria that OPEC intended to cut production levels. By February 2017, US oil investment, as measured by the number of drilling rigs in operation, reached its highest level since November 2015. [ Moreover, the shale oil threat is greater because producers in the United States have become more efficient thanks to improved operations and increased selectivity in the wells they exploit. Although the ultimate capacity of shale oil production is uncertain, its behavior is now a central feature of the new oil market and will help lead to more limited and shorter production and price cycles. [ **Bottom line** The OPEC agreement has hastened the rebalancing of the oil market'that is, when the supply of oil is in line with demand and accompanied by stable prices. The OPEC production agreement should reduce excess supply'at least temporarily. But the futures market in oil prices suggests that expectations are firmly anchored at around $50 a barrel. The forces unleashed by the OPEC agreement will limit its effectiveness over the next few years.

Policymakers will likely share a sense of growing optimism, because the recent strengthening of activity suggests that the world economy may finally snap out of its multi-year convalescence. Economic prescriptions have played an important part in the recovery, and will continue to do so for some time. Maintaining the positive growth momentum continues to require supportive macroeconomic policies. And the participants at the meetings will need to take action, individually and collectively, to make growth more inclusive and resilient. **Have we reached a turning point?** The short answer is yes'at least for now. Growth outturns in the second half of last year were generally solid. Manufacturing and confidence indicators are picking up, and there are signs that global trade volumes are rising along with them. That is why the International Monetary Fund in January projected a pickup in global growth this year and next'to 3.4 and 3.6 percent'compared to 3.1 percent in 2016. * The improved outlook partly reflects a projected pickup in advanced economy activity'helped by expectations of more expansionary US fiscal policy. * We are especially encouraged by stronger-than-expected economic activity in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan. * Emerging and developing economies, led by China and India, continue to contribute more than three-quarters of total global GDP growth in 2017. Adding to this is a projected normalization of conditions in Brazil and Russia, which have been facing deep recessions. So, yes, the global economy is moving into a better position. But it would be a mistake to assume that it will automatically return to rude health. In fact, there has rarely been a period when policy choices have mattered more for what comes next, especially since there are still considerable risks to the outlook. **Maintaining the momentum** In a number of advanced economies, for example, demand is still weak and inflation is not durably back to target_._ This calls for continued monetary support and a greater emphasis on fiscal policy in countries that have room in their budgets. These steps should be combined with structural reforms to lift productivity and boost long-term growth. Lack of demand is less of a problem in the United States, where growth would benefit more from efforts to expand supply, such as investment to revamp infrastructure, efficiency-enhancing corporate tax reform, and improvements in education. Stronger US growth would certainly be good for the global economy, but a changing US policy mix may also create knock-on effects, or spillovers. For example, depending on the nature of the US policy mix, a stronger dollar and rising US interest rates could lead to a sharper-than-expected tightening in global financial conditions. This could potentially put stress on some emerging economies and low-income countries. Sustaining the current growth momentum would also be helped by a successful transition toward slower but more balanced growth in China, and by further policy actions on the part of commodity exporters as they continue to adjust to lower commodity prices. Above all, we should collectively avoid self-inflicted injuries. This requires steering clear of policies that would seriously undermine trade, migration, capital flows, and the sharing of technologies across borders. Such measures would hurt the productivity, incomes, and living standards of _all_ citizens. **Global economic integration** Trade and technological innovation have allowed countries to grow the economic pie and improve living standards, while lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Yet more could be done to mitigate the unwelcome side-effects seen in some places'including a rise in income inequality, job losses in shrinking sectors, and protracted economic and social problems across structurally weaker regions. How can this be done? This is not an easy task, but it can start with boosting growth, and sharing the benefits more widely. A critical first step is to get serious about _inclusive_ growth. We have yet to fully understand the complex web of economic challenges faced by different cultures, regions, and demographic groups. We _do_ know, however, that higher- skilled workers are much more likely to benefit from innovation and economic openness. **This calls for greater efforts to equip lower-skilled workers** with the tools they need to seek and find better-paying jobs, such as targeted education programs, skills training, and employment incentives. * These active labor market policies can help ease workers' transitions to new employment. Their funding varies significantly across countries. Denmark, for instance, spends 1.9 percent of GDP on such policies, compared with 0.1 percent in the United States. * Of course, spending _more_ money is not enough; it must be spent _more efficiently_. Some initiatives have proven to be cost-effective'such as well-designed assistance for job search and job matching. More broadly, _all_ countries need to actively promote life-long learning to prepare citizens for technological changes. Singapore, for example, offers unconditional grants to all adults for training throughout their working lives. **Another priority for inclusive growth is the retooling of income policies and tax systems**. * In-work tax incentives and higher minimum wages can be helpful in some countries. So, too, can changes to tax and benefit systems, including more progressive income taxation. * IMF research shows that avoiding excessive inequality will help, not hinder, growth. We also know that policy tradeoffs can be minimized: for example, most countries would benefit from reforms that make their tax systems more equitable _and_ more efficient. In short, we have the capacity'and responsibility'to grow the economic pie, which will facilitate sharing it more equitably. Effective international cooperation will maximize the benefits of national policies if we: * step up efforts to address global external imbalances and complete reforms to strengthen financial systems; * protect and reinforce trade as an engine of broadly shared growth; and * work together to resolve some of the most pressing issues of our time, from global security and health issues to coping with natural disasters and climate change. G20 policymakers can move the needle on all these issues. After years of being stuck in a weak recovery, the world economy needs to move on, shape up, and generate greater prosperity for all.

Our [new research shows that provided countries can afford it, fiscal policy, through spending or tax incentives, can help governments overcome some obstacles to the reforms, particularly in the early stages. [Structural reforms help boost employment, encourage business start-ups, and raise productivity. For example, reforms to product markets, such as deregulation in industries like energy and transportation, can boost competition among firms. Reforms to labor markets, such as lower employment taxes and changes to unemployment benefits can help workers join the labor force and find jobs. At the same time, some of these reforms can entail short-term economic costs, and often face strong political opposition from vested interests. Our[ analysis shows that: * Reforms do not just grow the economy, they also reduce public debt burdens over time. Implementing reforms will therefore help cash-strapped governments. * Because reforms tend to boost growth and raise tax revenue, combining reform packages with temporary fiscal support'in the form of spending on high-return projects or tax incentives'may reduce rather than increase a country's debt burden over the medium term, even when such incentives are provided in a way that does not increase the budget deficit. * However, for countries to consider such packages, they need to be able to afford it, and have sustainable fiscal positions, a robust medium-term fiscal framework, and a credible commitment to major reforms. **Growth and public finances win with reforms** Our findings are based on new empirical and model-based research of past labor and product market reforms in 26 advanced economies, as well as more detailed case studies of reforms in Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. We found that labor and product market reforms generally increase GDP'up to 2-3 percent over the medium term, depending on the type of reform'by boosting productivity or employment. In turn, higher GDP brings in more tax revenues to the government. Both higher GDP and increased tax revenues reduce public debt-to-GDP ratios. This has been the case on average, for example, in past product market deregulation, such as in the mid-1990s in several network industries in Germany such as the telecommunications and the energy sector. **Fiscal cost for fiscal gain** We also found that because some reforms can temporarily reduce rather than increase GDP, they can damage public finances in the process. This can happen, for example, when governments reduce employment protection for regular workers, or cut unemployment benefits when the economy is weak. In such cases, in countries that can afford it, some temporary spending on high-return projects or tax incentives can make reforms work more effectively. This leads to fiscal gains over the medium term, when the output improvements due to reforms kick in. During the early stage of reforms, governments can use tax or spending incentives to help those most affected, which should help garner political support for the effort. However, these policies may be counterproductive in countries with little money to spare, unless they are implemented in a budget neutral way. For example, Finland, Germany, and the United Kingdom reduced the tax burden for people with low incomes. But they combined cuts in personal income tax rates with reforms in unemployment benefits and other social safety nets to help those people affected by the reforms, without increasing the budget deficit. Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom also combined incentives for product market reforms with reforms that reduced government spending'for example, cutting corporate taxes while also reducing government subsidies that benefitted industry. Occasionally fiscal sweeteners were provided, such as a tax write-off of capital losses from the deregulation of the taxi industry in Ireland, but only after reforms were implemented. The efforts to reduce government debt and deficits while providing incentives for reform meant that in some countries harmful cuts were made in infrastructure investment. The case for countries to decide when and how to use spending or lower taxes to support labor and product market reforms will vary. It depends on the type of reform, whether the economy is on a roll or in a spiral, and the government's ability to increase spending or lower taxes to support reform. Countries with sufficient room in their budgets can use it to provide temporary immediate support for reforms'particularly labor market reforms where the economy is weak. **What should countries without money to spare do? ** Countries should push forward on labor and product market reforms, prioritizing those that have lower costs in the near term. Such reforms will reduce public debt-to-GDP over time and alleviate pressures on tight budgets. These countries can also provide help, but in a budget neutral way, as part of a broader reform package. Moreover, they should design reforms in smart ways'for example, by passing job legislation reform that will come into force with a one- or two-year delay. This would encourage firms to invest and recruit in the near-term while the economy is still weak, without laying-off workers. **Reform ownership is critical** And for all countries, the case for providing fiscal support at the start of the reform process rests crucially on the credibility of the government's commitment to strong implementation of comprehensive reforms and sustainable fiscal policies.

And when a country's economy is suffering a severe economic crisis, the decisions become even more critical. Over the past few decades, protecting social programs and spending on health has been a cornerstone of the IMF's support for countries. **Healthy channels in IMF supported programs** A number of studies have found that IMF support for countries' reforms, on average, either preserve or increase public health spending (see box). One study finds that the effect of IMF programs is considerable'they increase public health spending by about 1 percent of GDP over a 5-year period. The reforms implemented under the programs are essential to put the economies of these countries on an even keel. Without reforms, a country's economy could collapse, along with its public healthcare system. While [one recent study suggests a few ways in which IMF support may impede spending on public health, their impact is offset by other important factors through which the IMF's support for a country positively affects public health spending. Here is a closer look at the different ways IMF support to a country in crisis can help it get back on its feet, and fund social protection programs like health care: * **Higher long-term economic growth.** Economic and financial stability promoted in IMF-supported programs can help governments raise revenue to finance health care. * **More donor support.** IMF support can help countries receive more financing from other donors, which increases the resources available to finance priority spending on health and other social programs. * **Tax reforms**. IMF programs typically emphasize tax reforms that increase revenues, which gives the government more money to spend on health care in a sustainable way. The number of countries with tax reforms has increased rapidly since 2007. This [paper shows the positive link between IMF support, reforms, and revenues for 126 low-income and middle-income countries. The potential for raising the revenue ratio is almost one percentage point of GDP in a given year. [ * **Social spending protection.** The explicit incorporation of minimum levels of social spending in IMF-supported reforms has encouraged countries to raise health spending. The number of requirements on social expenditure as well as public investment in low-income countries has increased substantially over recent years. The IMF's Independent Evaluation Office [found that 29 of 30 recent reform programs incorporated these minimum levels. The emphasis on growth-enhancing public expenditure'including education and health spending'in country reforms supported by the IMF also helps raise spending on public health. * **More efficient spending. **Improving the overall efficiency of spending can help governments finance spending on education, health, and investment. For example, phasing out [energy subsidies'which typically benefit the rich more than the poor'have been an important element to save money in various countries. In recent years, the number of requirements that help improve budget execution and control'and thus public spending efficiency'has increased considerably. In the area of public investment, the measures include introducing more rigorous appraisal, selection, and approval of investment projects, and strengthening management and monitoring of project implementation. Furthermore, higher public health spending efficiency means that governments can achieve better health outcomes with the same level of health spending. [ There are other ways the IMF can help a country in a crisis with health spending. For example, the recent experience of the countries affected by the Ebola epidemic'Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone'shows the positive influence of IMF financial support. Since September 2014, the IMF has provided emergency financial assistance to the three countries totaling US$378 million, to help respond to the Ebola outbreak. The [IMF's response helped the governments' make room in their budgets, which is crucial to boost health spending, and provided a catalytic role vis-\u00c3 -vis donors, whose assistance was largely directed at health spending. There is certainly still room to improve the design of IMF support to countries in crisis. When it comes to public health, the empirical evidence generally points to positive outcomes. ## Literature on public health spending [ Does the IMF constrain health spending in poor countries?

A decade ago, our former Research Department colleagues [Eswar Prasad, Raghuram Rajan, and Arvind Subramanian examined why the reverse had been true'capital generally flowed 'uphill'\u009d from poorer to richer countries. Building on the seminal work of [Robert Lucas, they argued that certain characteristics of poorer countries, such as weaker institutions and lower levels of education, may reduce the risk-adjusted returns to investing there. In this blog, we revisit the uphill flow puzzle and discuss its policy implications. We show that uphill flows, after intensifying ahead of the global financial crisis, have recently reversed direction. These shifts reflect several factors, but the projected normalization of monetary policy in key advanced economies and increased policy uncertainties make a large and persistent reversal of uphill flows unlikely. Going forward, emerging and developing economies should continue to focus on polices that enhance the benefits of inflows, temper capital-flow volatility, and improve the resilience and depth of domestic financial markets. **Shifts in global capital allocation** In the years preceding the crisis, advanced economies as a group received persistent and sizable net capital inflows. These inflows were mirrored by large and growing outflows from developing countries'and particularly China, the largest among them, which was integrating into the global economy'and exporters of raw materials, which benefited from the boom in commodity prices. Outflows from developing economies during this period were dominated by accumulation of official foreign exchange reserves. Since the crisis, the paradox has unwound. Firms and households in advanced economies reduced their debts, resulting in less investment and lower net inflows of capital. These developments were matched by reduced outflows from developing economies as China started to rebalance its economy toward domestic consumption and the commodity income windfall for commodity exporters vanished. The slowdown and eventual reversal in uphill flows largely reflected movements in official foreign reserves, which started registering an overall decline a few years ago. In fact, since 2014 net private flows to developing countries turned negative, as documented by earlier IMF [work, yet were offset by inflows as central banks unwound their foreign asset positions. **Role of saving and investment** The pre-crisis uphill flows mostly reflected saving-related factors and did not prevent falling investment in advanced economies or rising investment in developing economies in relation to world gross domestic product. Investment- to-GDP ratios fell in advanced economies, with sharply lower saving nonetheless driving an increase in external deficits. In contrast, investment grew strongly in developing economies despite the intensification of capital outflows. That's not surprising, given their generally lower stocks of capital. But that strength in investment was more than offset by a surge in saving. Intensive export orientation at the expense of consumption in China, and the resulting increase in commodity prices, were among the forces behind these patterns. Following the crisis, investment and saving trends continued to diverge between rich and poor countries. In advanced economies, current account balances improved as investment fell. In developing nations, meanwhile, current account balances weakened, reflecting relatively faster investment growth, which, while slowing sharply from its pre-crisis rate, outpaced an increase in saving. Thus, the more recent net flow of global saving has been in the direction of supporting higher investment in developing countries. **Outlook and policies** A large downhill flow of capital seems unlikely to persist in the near term. For one thing, net private inflows to developing countries have turned negative recently. True, stronger growth and infrastructure needs in these economies, as well as structural changes like aging populations in richer ones, could push capital in the 'right'\u009d direction. However, capital could again flow back to advanced economies as they tighten monetary policy, a prospect that began to appear more likely after the U.S. presidential election raised expectations for a more expansionary U.S. fiscal orientation. And big global uncertainties remain, not least because of the rising risk of protectionism, which could predominantly affect developing economies. Reaping the benefits of capital inflows remains a central challenge for developing economies. In general, meeting it will require a further strengthening of policy frameworks to lower the risk of potential capital-flow reversals. While exchange-rate flexibility can help provide a buffer, additional tools may be needed at times to maintain orderly market conditions. Moreover, robust institutions and policy frameworks remain critical, as highlighted by [earlier work, including well-functioning domestic and international financial markets to efficiently channel saving into investment.

Now, China needs to move toward a new stage of reforms designed to help rebalance its economy. The stakes for global prosperity are high'China is the second largest economy and contributes one-third of the world's growth.

Globalization and trade have been blamed, but entrenched slow growth'what economists call secular stagnation'may be the real culprit. Parents who took for granted that their children would enjoy a brighter future had their dreams dashed by the global financial crisis of 2008. Nine years later, rising populism and a return to nationalist, inward-looking policies threaten to unravel the postwar economic order. As Nicholas Crafts of the University of Warwick argues in our overview story, [declining productivity growth'the main reason for slow growth and falling incomes'was evident long before the crisis struck. This issue of _[F&amp;D_ looks at why and asks whether the world's advanced economies should resign themselves to secular stagnation or hope that the right policies can revive productivity and lasting economic growth. Diving into the causes of slow productivity growth, IMF economists Gustavo Adler and Romain Duval find [roots in the global financial crisis'tight credit undermined not only firms' productivity but also the economy's ability to redirect capital. Other factors were also in play, especially aging populations. Ronald Lee of the University of California, Berkeley, and Andrew Mason of the University of Hawaii, Manoa, argue convincingly that [slower population growth will almost certainly mean slower national income and GDP growth. But they also show that the effect on individuals'in per capita income and consumption' will depend on economic policies. We wonder what to do. Can policy choices calm fears about redistribution and fairness without shutting down trade, the main engine of postwar economic growth? What drives higher productivity and innovation? How can advanced economies adapt to an aging workforce? First, we must measure the right thing. Diane Coyle of the University of Manchester discusses the [pros and cons of GDP to measure economic welfare. Second, we should not forget that two-thirds of the world's population'namely, those in [developing and emerging market economies'face a different reality. Younger populations and still-vibrant productivity in many of these countries are driving higher economic growth at home and in the global economy. Third, we shouldn't go overboard. Global trade has been a leading force behind productivity growth, and barriers against it would hurt all economies, large and small. Instead of reaching for easy answers, economists and policymakers must probe their own economies' challenges.

Thomsen Debt is central to the functioning of a modern economy. Firms can use it to finance investments in future productivity. Households can use it to finance lumpy purchases, such as big consumer durables, or a home. Sometimes, however, firms' investments do not pan out or a household's main earner loses his or her job. Countries' legal systems generally recognize that in these cases, debtors and creditors alike'along with society at large'may be better off if there is an orderly procedure for reorganizing debts. Governments borrow too, of course, but there are no courts to direct a restructuring of **_sovereign _**debts'debts owed or guaranteed by the national government'nor can entire countries be put into receivership. This is where the IMF comes in. Over the past forty years, sovereign over indebtedness has been at the root of many of the balance-of-payments crises experienced by our member countries. Ideally, an IMF-supported program will seek to resolve these crises by performing a 'catalytic'\u009d role: namely, a strong belt-tightening and structural reform program implemented by the member government, when coupled with financial support provided by the IMF, will be designed to catalyze the member country's return to market access in a manner that will enable the government to service its debt under the original terms. **When debt becomes unsustainable ** There are circumstances, however, where the government's debt level is so high that it is 'unsustainable'\u009d; that is, where the scheduled debt service exceeds the capacity of the member to service it, even taking into account both a strong adjustment program and significant financial support from the IMF. In these circumstances, it is not feasible'either politically or economically'for the problem to be solved through further belt tightening. Any assessment of debt sustainability needs to be underpinned by realistic'rather than heroic'assumptions regarding future growth prospects, taking into account the reality that economies have often taken longer to recover from crises than was originally expected. When sovereign debt is unsustainable, the IMF's legal framework precludes it from providing financial support unless the program includes specific measures'normally including a debt restructuring'that credibly address the debt sustainability problem within the medium term. What is the rationale for that requirement? In the absence of such steps, IMF support would not be addressing the member's underlying balance of payments problems, as is required under the IMF's Articles of Agreement. Indeed, a program that fails to address unsustainable debt is likely to exacerbate such problems because it will create further uncertainty regarding the member's future. One potent source of uncertainty is the role of a big debt overhang in sapping political support for reforms from the public, which could see its sacrifices as primarily benefiting creditors. The uncertainty created by an unresolved debt problem may also deter new investment in the economy, and hence impede the recovery on which program success depends. Unless a program provides a path for a country to regain access to markets over the medium term, the IMF is not in a position to conclude that the program is addressing the member country's underlying problems in a meaningful way. Assessing viability in terms of a country's ability to re-access markets continues to be relevant when the country is a member of a currency union. Unless there are specific rules that provide for fiscal transfers between the sovereign members of the currency union, a country is not resolving its balance of payments problems sustainably so long as it must depend for an extended period on the support of other union members. Although considerable work has been done to establish a methodology to guide the IMF's debt sustainability analysis, the application of this methodology still requires the exercise of judgment. In particular, we need to make a realistic assessment of the unique circumstances of each member country. Because the IMF's debt sustainability analysis is central to its own decision making process, this work remains the responsibility of the IMF. We are precluded from delegating it to someone else. The IMF's assessments of debt sustainability are guided by the framework for [Public Debt Sustainability and Analysis in Market-Access Countries and [The Fund's Lending Framework and Sovereign Debt'Further Considerations. **The IMF's framework for assessing debt sustainability** The IMF uses two main methodologies to assess whether debt is sustainable. The first methodology asks if, by the end of the IMF program and with debt serviced on the original terms, debt ratios to GDP will be sufficiently low or on a clear enough downward path to restore lender confidence and allow the government once again to tap financial markets. The second, which is especially relevant when debt has a long maturity and particularly low interest rates, is to ask whether the country's annual financing needs'to cover gross payments of interest and principal as well as its primary fiscal balance'can reasonably be met by the markets going forward. In either case, it is critical that in our projections of feasible repayments, we realistically specify levels of primary surpluses that improve debt sustainability over time'rather than levels that would disrupt the economy so severely that tax revenues actually fall and fiscal targets are abandoned. In turn, our judgment will rely on both the country's own circumstances and our extensive experience with other members in distress. The IMF's framework requires it to account for risks to both program implementation and economic forecasts. For instance, in the recent case of Ukraine, creditors agreed to significant haircuts in order to reduce debt to a sustainable level as suggested by the debt-to-GDP framework. In the case of the ongoing discussions with Greece, we have instead found the framework that focuses on the annual financing need to be more appropriate, mainly because Greece's euro area partners have opted to provide debt relief through very significant extension of maturities and reduction in interest rates, rather than through upfront haircuts. **Providing debt relief** When debt is judged to be unsustainable, there are various ways in which the necessary debt relief can be delivered. Where the debts being restructured are claims held by the private sector, the debt restructuring is normally implemented at the outset of the program or as a condition for the program's first review. Where claims are held by official bilateral creditors, the approach may vary. For example, if the debt is restructured under the auspices of the Paris Club, specific debt relief commitments are made by each official bilateral creditor at the outset of the program (in the form of the Agreed Minute) and these commitments are subsequently implemented through the modification of the individual loan agreements. There may be circumstances where official bilateral creditors prefer to make the actual delivery of the debt relief conditional upon the full implementation of the program. Such an approach may be warranted, for example, where there are concerns regarding a member's track record of economic adjustment. In these circumstances, however, the commitment to provide the necessary debt relief'while it may be contingent on the implementation of the program'would need to be made at the beginning of the program and would need to be sufficiently credible. The credibility of the commitment would need to take into account the specificity of the modalities of debt delivery. An excessively vague commitment would raise uncertainty, including in the markets, regarding the delivery of debt relief, thereby undermining the chances of the program's success. Moreover, while we can agree to make debt relief contingent on the debtor country meeting specific policy targets, such targets need to be realistic for the debt strategy to remain credible. It is important to emphasize that while debt relief may be needed in order for the IMF to lend, the decision to seek such relief remains a decision of the member. Moreover, in circumstances where debt relief is pursued, the negotiations take place between the member country and its creditors, although the IMF is typically called upon to explain the basis for the Fund's debt sustainability assessment. Wherever possible, the IMF encourages a member to restructure unsustainable debt without a default, which can be particularly disruptive. To conclude, when sovereign debts are unsustainable, unless grant financing is available, some degree of debt relief, coupled with a strong but credible adjustment program, is the only means to make the best of a bad situation. Pretending that unpayable debts can be repaid will only sap the effectiveness of the debtor's adjustment efforts, ultimately making all parties lose more than if they had promptly faced the facts.

Ostry Over the past three decades, income [inequality has gone up in most advanced economies and in many developing ones as well. Why? Much of the research on inequality has focused on advances in technology and liberalization of trade as the main drivers. While technology and trade are global trends that are difficult to resist, IMF studies have shown that the design of government policies matters and can help limit increases in inequality. Another important conclusion of IMF research: rising inequality poses risks to durable economic growth. This puts addressing inequality squarely within the IMF's mandate to help countries improve economic performance. So, the IMF is now building on years of research into inequality to offer its member countries policy solutions, particularly on equitable ways to tax and spend. **Understanding inequality** A good example is Bolivia, which had one of the highest levels of income inequality in Latin America at the turn of the century. When prices of its commodity exports boomed early in this century, the country saw a big reduction in inequality that put it in the middle of the regional pack. Eager to preserve those gains, the government wanted to understand the causes of the decline, and to develop policies that could keep inequality from creeping back up as a result of the recent drop in commodity prices. Against this backdrop, inequality featured prominently in the IMF's annual consultations with the government in [2015 and [2016, which drew on a detailed [study using income data for Bolivian households. This deep dive [showed that inequality had declined because the wealth from commodity exports had been shared with the rest of the economy through increased public investment, social transfers, and a higher minimum wage. Another [study demonstrated the key role that expanding access to financial services could play in lowering inequality. The IMF developed a [model of the Bolivian economy to simulate how inequality was likely to evolve and to test which policies could help preserve the gains. Maintaining infrastructure investment and making it more efficient and better targeting cash transfers turned out to be the best policy levers. Ethiopia offers another example of practical IMF advice. There, the IMF reviewed the evolution of inequality and measured the distributional impact of policies to enhance growth. Its recommendations included making income-tax thresholds more progressive, promoting financial instruments for rural savers, and revamping indirect subsidies to better serve low-income households. **Causes: budget deficits, labor markets** In studying the causes of inequality, IMF economists have focused on three policy areas: reducing [budget deficits through tax increases or spending cuts, liberalizing [labor markets, and removing barriers to the movement of [capital across borders. While these policies can be beneficial, they can also sometimes have the side effect of raising inequality. ## Inequality by country: IMF reports Discussions of inequality have featured in country reports in all regions of the world and for advanced and developing economies. * **Africa:** [Ethiopia, [Republic of Congo, [Zambia * **Asia:** [Kyrgyz Republic, [Myanmar, [Singapore * **Europe:** [Denmark, [Hungary, [Lithuania * **Middle East:** [Israel, [Saudi Arabia * **Latin America:** [Brazil, [Guatemala, [Honduras Source: Selected IMF country reports for 2015'16. Studies of specific countries corroborated those findings, which were based on a broad sample. Research on Honduras, Guatemala, Republic of Congo, and Uganda confirmed that fiscal policies have a strong impact on inequality. They also show that the size of the impact depends on how taxes are collected and revenue spent. The effects on inequality are larger when there is less recourse to direct income taxes and greater reliance on indirect taxes; on the other hand, spending on infrastructure reduces inequality. [Case studies of Ethiopia and Myanmar confirm that financial sector reforms can exacerbate inequality if access to financial services remains limited and labor mobility is constrained. **Consequences: inequality and growth** The importance that many governments are now giving to addressing inequality suggests that they feel that not doing so will have adverse socio-economic consequences. Their concerns have been bolstered by the finding of IMF research that inequality makes economic growth less durable. This result has attracted considerable [attention because it shows that high inequality imposes a direct economic cost, in addition to the costs highlighted by other (non-IMF) authors such as capture of the political process by elites, and a decline in social cohesion. The result also puts inequality within the remit of the IMF's work: fostering sustained growth, a goal of IMF advice, requires some attention to inequality. Why does greater inequality end up hampering durable growth? In developing economies, higher inequality has sometimes led to social or political crises, which in turn can derail growth. In advanced economies, IMF [work shows that greater inequality in incomes may lead to excessive borrowing by low- and middle-income households, which eventually triggers a crisis, a sequence of events that characterized the run-ups to both the Great Depression and the Great Recession. The IMF's latest review of the US economy showed that income [polarization since 2000 has 'had a negative impact on the economy, hampering the main engine of US growth: consumption.'\u009d [ **Cures for excessive inequality** Studies of the causes and consequences of excessive inequality naturally lead to discussions of possible remedies. For example, if fiscal policies contribute to inequality, the IMF's advice on the design of these polices needs to account for that fact. This is both because the distributional consequences may be important in their own right to some governments, and because they can reduce the durability of growth. The [design of fiscal policy is critical for both redistribution and 'predistribution'\u009d'improving equality of opportunity to prevent extreme inequality from arising in the first place. These policies include public spending on health and education, which can improve equality of opportunity for people from lower-income households. In contrast, redistribution refers to actions taken after the fact so that disposable'or net'incomes are more equal than market incomes. Steps include progressive taxation, cash transfers to low-income families, and other welfare benefits. One important [research finding, which has implications for the design of many policies, is that redistribution, unless extreme, does not have an adverse impact on growth. **Conclusion** To summarize, IMF work has made important contributions to the study of inequality. * On **causes,** the finding that economic policies are an important determinant of inequality implies that governments can take steps to reduce inequality when it is deemed excessive; * On **consequences,** inequality has been shown to have a direct economic cost in terms of reduced durability of growth'this puts it with in the remit of the IMF's core work; * On **cures,** the design of policies should take into account the distributional outcomes. This is increasingly being done in the [advice that the IMF gives to it member countries.

The IMF recently adopted a set of [proposals on Islamic banking and called for a more comprehensive set of policies to ensure financial stability in countries with Islamic banking and support the sound development of the industry. The IMF is now calling for additional work and cooperation by its staff with other international agencies to improve the adoption of relevant standards for Islamic banking and to address remaining regulatory gaps. The industry mushroomed to more than $1.5 trillion in assets last year from about $100 billion in the late 1990s and now has a presence in 60 countries, mostly in the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, but increasingly in Africa, Central Asia, and Europe. While it represents less than 2 percent of global banking assets, its share is much bigger in many countries and has become systemically important (meaning its assets account for more than 15% of the total) in 14 of them, including Malaysia, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. ## Islamic banking in numbers [Islamic banking refers to financial services that conform with Islamic finance principles, which bans interest, excessive speculation, gambling and short-sales; requires fair treatment; and institutes sanctity of contracts. **Some facts:** * **60 countries** where it is present * **$1.5 trillion** in global assets in 2016 * **14 countries** in the Middle East and Asia with more than 15% of assets in Islamic banking * **2010,** the year when **_Sukuks_** (Islamic bonds) debuted in the New York Stock Exchange.

What's more, its [guiding principles can promote financial-sector resilience. Yet the industry's rapid growth and characteristics that distinguish it from conventional banking pose challenges for supervisors and central bankers. As a result, there is broad international recognition of the need for a policy framework and an environment that promotes the financial stability and development of the industry. **International norms** For more than a decade, the Kuala Lumpur-based [Islamic Financial Services Board has led efforts to develop regulatory and supervisory standards that complement existing international norms in areas relevant to Islamic banking. This process culminated in 2015 with the development of the 'Core Principles for Islamic Finance Regulation'\u009d for banking. Now the challenge will be to ensure that these standards are applied broadly and consistently. A number of other important areas still need to be addressed. These include developing robust resolution regimes (to deal with failing banks) and other financial safety nets and expediting the issuance of high-quality liquid assets such as sovereign **Sukuk**, a type of government-issued security. Finally, the recent emergence of hybrid financial products that replicate aspects of conventional finance in an Islamic banking context have raised new and complex risks that remain to be addressed by regulators.

But national borders make that task much harder, opening possibilities for tax avoidance by multinationals and raising tough jurisdictional issues when resource deposits cross frontiers. **Familiar problems, but much larger** The countries with the most resources are commonly not those that most use them. So it's no surprise that some of the world's first multinationals were extractive companies, such as Standard Oil or Royal Dutch Shell, or that multinationals account for the vast bulk of government revenue from the sector (except where state companies predominate). All the techniques of tax avoidance associated with multinational activities'the subject of the G20-OECD project on [Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)'arise in the extractive industries. But while the problems there are similar to those found in other sectors, they are often on a larger scale'and with some distinctive twists. [ Take, for instance, problems in applying the 'arm's length principle'\u009d to the 'transfer'\u009d prices that multinationals use to allocate taxable profit across the countries where they operate. Under the arm's length principle, [transfer prices should be the same as those that would have been set by unrelated parties. You might think that figuring out such prices would be easier in the extractive industries than in many others. Sometimes, as with oil, active commodity markets do indeed provide good starting points for transfer pricing. And hard-to-price intangibles (patents, branding, and so on) generally play a smaller role than they do in, say, the pharmaceutical industry. But significant problems do arise in the extractive industries. For some resources (such as bromine, a mineral used in dyes and flame retardants, and its compounds) there are no regularly reported market prices. And the high tax rates applied in the sector can provide especially strong incentives to manipulate transfer prices; so too can the need to arrive at valuations not only for taxes on profits, but also for the royalties (charges on the value of production) commonplace in the extractive industries. These and other technical challenges are addressed in a new book, _[International Taxation and the Extractive Industries_, which draws on the advice that the IMF provides to its member countries. One issue that the book explores gives a flavor of the challenges that, while not unique to the extractive industries, loom especially large there. This is the very nerdy topic of 'indirect transfers of interest,'\u009d meaning the use of a chain of companies to realize capital gains in a country where they will be lightly taxed, rather than where the asset that generates the gain is located. The sums involved can be huge: in Mauritania, for example, a potential gain of $4 billion on a gold transaction wasn't taxed there. **Pipelines, railroads and borders** Geography presents some distinctive problems. Bringing resources to market can involve building infrastructure that spans national borders, such as a pipeline or railroad linking a mine to a port in a neighboring country. The book looks at the international law involved, and in particular at the difficulties of applying the arm's length principle. As one chapter argues, the range of possible outcomes when trying to apply it is so large as to undermine the credibility of the principle itself. Resource deposits that cross borders pose problems for coordination between countries'and a risk of conflict. The book looks at the various types of 'unitization agreements'\u009d that can be reached when countries have agreed sea boundaries, and at experience with joint development zones when they do not. The book addresses many other questions. To give just one example, how can the impact of international tax arrangements on incentives to invest in the extractive industries be assessed? We can't claim that the book is a page- turner. But we do hope it will help those'whether in government, civil society, business or academia'who have to navigate these issues, which are as important as they are hard.

Every year there are, on average, 12 storms that pass through the region, of which about half reach hurricane force winds (winds above 119 kilometers per hour). Hurricanes are the leading cause of natural disasters in the Caribbean, making the region one of the most vulnerable in the world. Yet, only 62 percent of disasters caused by hurricanes have recorded data on economic damages, as the information is difficult to collect. **Wind damage** In my new [paper, I look at the relationship between maximum wind speeds and the damages hurricanes cause to estimate the missing data for the Caribbean, and to calculate the potential costs that climate change would have in the region. I find that damages in percent of GDP increase by about 3 percent with an increase in wind speed of 1 percent (see chart). [ **Completing the missing data** The international disaster database ([EM-DAT) shows that between 1950 and 2014 hurricanes caused 238 natural disasters in the Caribbean. Of those storms, the database only recorded damages for 148 hurricanes, which caused roughly $52 billion (in 2010 constant U.S. dollars) in damages. This is equivalent to an average of 1.6 percent of GDP in damages every year in each island. My findings show that the remaining disasters could have caused damages of about 0.9 percent of GDP every year, bringing the average destruction of hurricanes to 2.5 percent of GDP a year (see chart). [ Even then, this figure might still underestimate the costs of hurricanes in the Caribbean, given the number of under reported disasters in the 1950s and 1960s and the restrictive classification for defining a disaster. So, if we assume that all storms with hurricane strength winds that passed within 60 miles of the islands caused damages (a total of 335 storms including the 238 disasters), the average island in the sample would have sustained annual damages of 5.7 percent of GDP over the past 65 years. **Climate change costs** Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of hurricanes, as warmer sea surface temperatures will create the right environment for large storms to form and strengthen. If temperatures were to increase by 4.3\u00c2\u00b0C by 2100 ([IPCC scenario RCP8.5), then average damages in the Caribbean would increase by about 34 percent as the frequency of the most intense storms would increase. Even if temperatures were to increase only by about 3\u00c2\u00b0C by the end of the century, which is close to what the November 2016 Paris Agreement on Climate Change would achieve without further target increases according to independent [experts, the increase in damages would still be close to 24 percent. **More needs to be done** Given the large costs that hurricanes already cause in the Caribbean and the potential for significant increases in damages with climate change, it is important for governments to take more actions to be better prepared. They will need to implement soft adaptation measures, such as improved early warning systems and better building codes, as well as hard adaption measures, such as investments in resilient infrastructure. Governments will also need to build fiscal buffers to cover the recurrent costs of disasters, and insurance (for example, [CCRIF) will also be crucial to spread risks.

Globally, [farm subsidies amount to over $560 billion a year'equivalent to nearly four times the aid given to developing countries by richer ones. Major emerging-market nations have increased subsidies rapidly, even as rich nations cut theirs drastically. Meanwhile, tariffs on farm products remain a major point of contention in global trade talks. One third of global food production goes to [waste, while food insecurity is still rampant in developing countries. Even with the explosion of agricultural productivity since the middle of the 20th century, food security remains a challenge for much of the developing world. [Food- calorie production will have to expand by 70 percent by 2050 to keep up with a [global population that's forecast to grow to 9.7 billion from last year's 7.3 billion. Food insecurity can lead to violence and conflicts that can spill over well beyond borders. How can policymakers meet the challenge? Removing market distortions, while not the whole answer, would go a long way in reducing food insecurity in developing nations. First, all countries must make a concerted effort to dismantle direct and indirect barriers to trade, which will help low-income nations develop their agricultural sectors. At the same time, low-income countries must also take action to raise productivity by removing obstacles to investment, thereby attracting much-needed foreign capital. **Land, productivity, and potential** Putting all of the world's unused land into service, assuming everything else remains unchanged, would only suffice to feed 9 billion people. Of course, this rough calculation doesn't account for advances in technology or reductions in food waste and land degradation, but it does illustrate the dimensions of the problem. The answer, then, is improved productivity. There's plenty of scope to increase output on existing agricultural land: in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, [yields are currently 50 percent below potential. Yet barriers to cross-border investment make it harder to finance the adoption of new technologies that could boost yields. These barriers include inadequate infrastructure, risks of expropriation, and questions of land tenure or more generally opaque property rights. A [surge in cross-border land deals in developing countries following the food crisis of 2007'08 has since abated, raising questions about the sustainability of such investments. As a result, while demand for food has shifted from West to East as a result of a different pace of population growth, advanced economies still account for the lion's share of exports. **Challenges ahead** Rapid urbanization and galloping population growth, especially in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, haven't been matched by increases in domestic food supplies, leading to growing dependence on imports. Since 1990, 27 nations have switched from being net exporters of food to being net importers, including Honduras, the Philippines, Zimbabwe, and Vietnam. Food has long been a sticking point in international trade talks, even though it makes up just 8 percent of the value of global commerce. Disagreements over agriculture torpedoed the Doha Round of global trade talks in 2008, for example. All countries continue to have a strong antitrade bias in the structure of aid to their farmers, wielding policy instruments'such as tariffs and quotas'that have serious consequences for consumers. Especially distorted markets include those for soybeans, sugar, rice, wheat, and beef. Removing barriers would help link low income countries to global trade. Paradoxically, policies aimed at stabilizing prices and availability of food can have the opposite effect. In 2008, for example, rapidly rising prices prompted exporters to impose restrictions on overseas shipments of food in a bid to increase domestic supplies. Meanwhile, food importers lowered barriers to purchases from abroad. Taken together, these two policies exacerbated the food-price spike. There are more effective ways to reduce price volatility in low-income countries, where food accounts more than half of total consumption. Food-price spikes can be damped by measures that include ensuring higher agricultural productivity, improved supply chains, and regional coordination to maintain and manage grain reserves. Climate change poses yet another challenge to food security. In some regions, changes in average temperatures and patterns of precipitation, along with extreme weather events such as heat waves, reduce crop yields and livestock productivity. In other regions, moderate average temperature increases could instead raise yields. Less-developed countries closer to the equator are the most vulnerable. Ethiopia, where the two main rainy seasons supply more than 80 percent of its agricultural yields, recently experienced some of the worst droughts in decades. Such extreme weather events are expected to worsen and increase in frequency. Measures such as 'climate-smart'' agriculture can ease the impact of climate change by offering smallholders opportunities to produce more nutritious crops in a sustainable and efficient way. Still, the challenges posed by climate change will only increase pressure on policymakers to dismantle the barriers to trade and investment that are restraining productivity gains in agriculture. _Read our _[commodities special feature_ in Chapter 1 of our October __2016 _[World Economic Outlook _for more details on this issue.

Traveling through Africa in the last few days, I have been amazed by the vitality I have witnessed: business startups investing in the future, new infrastructure under construction, and a growing middle class. Many Africans are now making a better living and fewer are suffering from poverty. My current host, Uganda, for example, has more than halved its absolute poverty rate to about 35 percent from close to 90 percent in 1990. But we have also seen a flip side. Poverty, of course, but inequality as well remain stubbornly high in most developing countries, including in Africa, and too often success is not shared by all. We have learned, both from working with our member countries, and from our [research, that sharing the fruits of growth'what we call [inclusion'is key to achieving sustainable economic growth. All segments of society should feel that they have an opportunity to make a better life for themselves. Our new [staff analysis, released today, uncovers the various channels through which critical reforms that promote growth (such as those in agriculture, the financial sector, and public investment) can sometimes widen inequality in lower-income countries. The study also illustrates how additional measures can mitigate such growth and equality trade-offs. The bottom line is this: First, pro-growth policies can be truly inclusive only if policies are designed with careful attention to the details of who gains and who loses. Second, well-targeted measures can ensure that everyone gains from essential economic reforms'and help further strengthen the case for pursuing reforms. **A look at who gains and loses** Lifting growth and reducing inequality is especially hard in countries where workers cannot relocate easily and there are big productivity differences between services, industry, and agriculture. A large informal economy, poor infrastructure and lack of financial services make the task even more difficult. Yet, in many of the IMF's poorest member countries, this is often the case. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, it is more than twice as expensive to move from rural to urban areas than it is in China. Only a third of sub-Saharan African households have electricity, compared to 85 percent in the rest of the world. And in low-income countries, only about 20 percent of the adult population has a bank account, compared to more than 80 percent in the rest of the world. Such barriers get in the way of successful and equitable reforms. Infrastructure development and financial sector reforms are examples. More, and more efficient, spending on roads, airports, power grids and education help an economy grow more productive and make it easier for people to relocate from farms to cities. But infrastructure investment can also increase inequality if some sectors of the economy become more competitive than others, particularly if labor mobility is limited. The case is similar for financial sector reforms. On the positive side, these reforms could make it cheaper to borrow, thereby stimulating private investment and boosting growth. But unless financial reforms are deep enough, they may not help poorer segments of the population obtain access to credit and financial services. **How to deliver strong, but inclusive growth** So, what can be done? The answer is not for policymakers to hold off on reforms that boost productivity and growth**. **Rather, policymakers should consider options that make these reforms more palatable from both a growth and distributional perspective. With this in mind, our staff paper looks at a number of country cases and analyzes how well-targeted measures can complement reforms and offset adverse distributional impact. For instance, if Malawi were to consider reducing subsidies for maize production to enhance productivity in the agricultural sector, then targeted cash transfers to affected households would help provide immediate support to farmers who may be hurt by this move. This approach has been successful in reducing poverty and inequality in countries such as Ethiopia, which has one of the largest social transfer programs in Africa. Similarly, with regard to financial sector reform, if Ethiopia were to increase credit to the private sector to promote manufacturing and boost growth and employment, complementing this by broadening financial access to the rural population and increasing labor mobility'through easier transport that connect rural and urban areas, affordable urban housing, and training'would help reduce inequality across sectors. Rural workers would then be able to find better paying jobs in more modern and competitive sectors, such as manufacturing and services. Governments can also target investment to improve productivity in disadvantaged sectors, and even out the impact of other reforms. In Myanmar, for example, where half the workforce is on farms, investment in electrification, irrigation, and research and development for improved seed varieties could sharply improve agricultural productivity. There is no doubt that governments will face challenges in building a consensus for bold policies to boost growth. The IMF will continue to work with them, advocating reforms that bear fruits for everybody to enjoy.

While the IMF's work on inequality has attracted the most attention, it is one of several new areas into which the institution has branched out in recent years. A unifying framework for all this work can be summarized in two words: **Inclusive growth**. We want growth, but we also want to make sure: * that people have [jobs'this is the basis for people to feel included in society and to have a sense of dignity; * that women and men have equal opportunities to participate in the economy'hence our focus on [gender; * that the poor and the middle class share in the prosperity of a country'hence the work on [inequality and shared prosperity; * that, as happens, for instance when countries discover natural resources, wealth is not captured by a few'this is why we worry about corruption and [governance; * that there is [financial inclusion'which makes a difference in investment, food security and health outcomes; and * that growth is shared just not among this generation but with future generations'hence our work on building resilience to [climate change and [natural disasters. In short, a common thread through all our initiatives is that they seek to promote inclusion'an opportunity for everyone to make a better life for themselves. These are not just fancy words; a click on any of the links above shows how the IMF is making work on inclusion a part of its daily operations. Inclusion is important, but so of course is growth. 'A larger slice of the pie for everyone calls for a bigger pie'\u009d ([Lipton, 2016). So when we push for inclusive growth, we are not advocating as role models either the former Soviet Union or present day North Korea'those are examples of 'inclusive misery,' not inclusive growth. Understanding the sources of productivity and long-run growth'and the structural policies needed to deliver growth'thus remains an important part of the IMF's agenda. **Globalization and inclusion** The IMF was set up to foster international cooperation. Hence, to us, inclusion refers not just to the sharing of prosperity within a country, but to the sharing of prosperity among all the countries of the world. International trade, capital flows, and migration are the channels through which this can come about. This is why we stand firmly in favor of globalization, while recognizing that there is discontent with some of its effects and that much more could be done to share the prosperity it generates. Higher growth should help address some of the discontent, as argued by Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman in his book, _[The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth_. Friedman shows that, over the long sweep of history, strong growth by 'the broad bulk'\u009d of a society's citizens is associated with greater tolerance in attitudes towards immigrants, better provision for the disadvantaged in society, and strengthening of democratic institutions. However, designing policies so they deliver inclusive growth in the first place will be a more durable response than leaving matters to the trickle-down effects of growth. **Policies for inclusive growth** **_'\u00a6 Trampolines and safety nets:_** 'More inclusive economic growth demands policies that address the needs of those who lose out '\u00a6 Otherwise our political problems will only deepen'\u009d ([Lipton, 2016). Trampoline policies such as job counseling and retraining allow workers to bounce back from job loss: they help people adjust faster when economic shocks occur, reduce long unemployment spells and hence keep the skills of workers from depreciating. While such programs which already exist in many advanced economies, they deserve further study so that all can benefit from best practice. Safety net programs have a role to play too. Governments can offer wage insurance for workers displaced into lower-paying jobs and offer employers wage subsidies for hiring displaced workers. Programs such as the U.S. earned income tax credit should be extended to further narrow income gaps while encouraging people to work ([Obstfeld, 2016). **_'\u00a6 Broader sharing of the benefits of the financial sector and financial globalization:_** We need 'a financial system that is both more ethical and oriented more to the needs of the real economy'a financial system that serves society and not the other way round'\u009d ([Lagarde, 2015). Policies that broaden access to finance for the poor and middle class are needed to help them garner the benefits of foreign flows of capital. Increased capital mobility across borders has often fueled international tax competition and deprived governments of revenues (a 'race to the bottom leaves everyone at the bottom,'\u009d ([Lagarde, 2014). The lower revenue makes it harder for governments to finance trampoline policies and safety nets without inordinately high taxes on labor or regressive consumption taxes. Hence, we need international coordination against tax avoidance to prevent the bulk of globalization gains from accruing disproportionately to capital ([Obstfeld, 2016). **_'\u00a6 'Pre-distribution' and redistribution:_** Over the long haul, polices that improve access to good education and health care for all classes of society are needed to provide better equality of opportunity. However, this is neither very easy nor an overnight fix. Hence, in the short run, 'pre-distribution' policies need to be complemented by redistribution: 'more progressive tax and transfer policies must play a role in spreading globalization's economic benefits more broadly'\u009d ([Obstfeld, 2016).

These changes have been mainly shaped by: * _**An anticipated shift in the U.S. policy mix, higher growth and inflation, and a stronger dollar**. _In the United States'while potential policy changes remain uncertain'fiscal policy is likely to become expansionary, while monetary policy is expected to tighten faster than previously expected because of stronger demand and inflation pressures. As a result, growth is projected to rise to 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent in 2018'a cumulative increase in GDP of \u00c2? percentage point relative to the October forecast. The expected change in the policy mix and growth has led to an increase in global long-term interest rates, a stronger dollar in real effective terms, and a moderation of capital flows to Latin America. * **_Improved outlook for other advanced economies and China_** for 2017'18, reflecting somewhat stronger activity in the second half of 2016 as well as projected policy stimulus. * _**Some recovery in commodity prices**_**,** especially metal and oil prices, on the back of strong infrastructure and real estate investment in China, expectations of fiscal easing in the United States, and agreement among major petroleum producers to cut supply. **The impact of these global currents on Latin America is mixed, and domestic factors continue to dominate for some countries. ** A positive boost from higher anticipated demand in the United States could be offset by higher global interest rates and uncertainty stemming from possible changes in U.S. trade and immigration policy, particularly for Mexico and Central America. At the same time, higher commodity prices since early 2016 have benefited commodity exporters. Yet, commodity prices are still expected to remain low relative to their historical standards. On balance, economic activity in the region is expected to expand by 1.2 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, following a contraction of 0.7 percent in 2016. The projected recovery is weaker than in our October forecast, given persistent weakness in some of the largest economies even as others continue to see moderate growth. To spur activity, countries in the region are easing monetary policy, where appropriate, using available space to calibrate fiscal adjustment, and, more importantly, pursuing much-needed supply-side reforms. **South America: domestic policies and commodity prices at play** In **_Brazil_**, GDP continued to contract in the third quarter of 2016, and end-year activity indicators point to a delay in the recovery as private spending remains weak. Real GDP growth in 2017 is expected to turn positive and reach 0.2 percent. However, elevated unemployment and high private sector debt will continue to be a drag on demand. To spur growth, the government has announced measures to help highly indebted companies and reforms to reduce red tape and the cost of doing business. To bolster confidence in public finances, a constitutional amendment to cap central government noninterest spending in real terms was approved, and the government has submitted to Congress a draft pension reform. Meanwhile, the fiscal situation of several subnational governments has become increasingly difficult, and new legislation is expected to lay the basis for state-level adjustment and reform programs monitored by the federal government. Inflation has been declining rapidly in recent months, and at end-2016 was below the upper limit of the tolerance band. Citing weaker than expected growth, faster than expected disinflation, and progress with fiscal reform, the central bank accelerated significantly the pace of monetary policy easing in its last policy meeting. In **_Argentina_**, the pace of contraction of economic activity slowed in the second half of 2016, but real GDP is projected to rebound this year, as higher real wages boost consumption, stronger external demand supports exports, and public investment accelerates. Still, because of the weaker than forecasted output growth in the last two quarters of 2016, GDP growth projections for 2016 and 2017 were revised down to -2.4 and 2.2 percent, respectively. The successful tax amnesty is expected to provide some fillip to domestic demand and help achieve the fiscal targets in 2016 and 2017. Inflation is expected to fall significantly but remain slightly above the central bank's target in 2017. Continuing with macroeconomic adjustment and advancing a strengthening of the institutional framework will help bolster investor confidence in the fiscal and monetary policy targets and facilitate a rebound of private investment. At the same time, advancing the supply-side reform agenda remains essential to rebuild the foundation for stronger, sustained, and more equitable growth. In **_Colombia_**, timely monetary and fiscal tightening have supported a faster than expected narrowing of the current account deficit, hence reducing external risks. Economic activity has been somewhat weaker than previously anticipated, growing by 0.3 percentage points lower in 2016 than projected earlier, and inflation pressures are dissipating gradually. Medium-term growth will be reinforced by the recently signed peace agreement and a structural tax reform, which will create space for key infrastructure and social spending. **_Chile_'s** growth is projected at 2.1 percent in 2017, on top of the increase of 1.6 percent in 2016. Higher external demand, a stronger outlook for copper prices, and significant monetary easing are the main factors driving the pickup. But an uncertain regional outlook, higher interest rates abroad, and still low confidence at home could stand in the way of a noticeable recovery. In **_Peru_**, growth remains relatively resilient. Growth is expected to reach 4.3 percent in 2017 as a result of expanding copper production, higher copper prices, a rebound in regional and local public spending, and robust private consumption. With the output gap closing, focus should shift to gradual fiscal consolidation, while preserving public infrastructure spending, and growth friendly-structural reforms such as decreasing informality, raising the level of education, deepening capital markets, and reducing red tape. The economic outlook for **_Ecuador _**has improved, in light of the better access to international capital markets prompted by the recovery in oil prices. **_Venezuela_** remains in a deep economic crisis on a path to hyperinflation, led by a large fiscal deficit that has been monetized, extensive economic distortions, and a severe restriction on the availability of imports of intermediate goods. Economic activity is projected to contract sharply in 2017, while inflation is expected to accelerate further. **Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean ** **_Mexico's_** economy continues to grow moderately but is entering a difficult terrain. The outlook is clouded by uncertainty about U.S. trade policy which, along with tighter financial conditions, will be a drag on activity. To maintain market confidence and put public debt firmly on a downward path, it is important to persevere with fiscal consolidation. Although inflation has been rising following the sharp peso depreciation and increases in energy prices, the tightening of monetary policy should help keep inflation expectations under control. Going forward, further tightening will only be needed to prevent any second-round effects, as the rise in inflation that is due to changes in relative prices of tradable goods will be temporary. Economic activity in **_Central America _**_and the_**_ Dominican Republic_** has been supported by faster U.S. growth, though higher global interest rates and an appreciation of the dollar pose downside risks, particularly for countries where exchange rates do not depreciate with respect to the U.S. dollar. Inflation is low, at 2\u00c2? percent, and external positions are robust given still low commodity prices and strong remittances inflow in some countries. Prospects for the **_Caribbean_** region are improving, with moderate growth projected for 2017. Growth in tourism-dependent economies will be supported by the expected higher growth in the United States, while commodity exporters will benefit from somewhat higher (though still low) commodity prices, notably of oil. The region continues to face several risks, including the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships and a high degree of policy uncertainty in the United States. **Countries should enhance resilience and long-term growth** Amid increasingly volatile external conditions, exchange rate flexibility has served the region well and should remain the first line of defense against shocks. Well-established monetary policy frameworks in the region are suited to limit the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices. Strong risk management practices and policies facilitating corporate balance sheet repair are also critical to reduce vulnerabilities arising from a tightening of global financial conditions and sharp currency movements. Countries should continue to use available space to calibrate fiscal adjustment, as commodity prices are expected to remain low relative to their historical levels, notwithstanding the recent uptick. The needed pace of adjustment will depend on debt levels and market pressures. Beyond macroeconomic policy adjustment, structural reforms'such as decreasing informality and red tape, boosting infrastructure quality, and improving education and rule of law'are essential to support medium-term growth.

An accumulation of recent data suggests that the global economic landscape started to shift in the second half of 2016. Developments since last summer indicate somewhat greater growth momentum coming into the new year in a number of important economies. Our earlier projection, that world growth will pick up from last year's lackluster pace in 2017 and 2018, therefore looks increasingly likely to be realized. At the same time, we see a wider dispersion of risks to this short-term forecast, with those risks still tilted to the downside. Uncertainty has risen. **Our central projection is that global growth will rise to a rate of 3.4 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018, from a 2016 rate of 3.1 percent**. Much of the better growth performance we expect this year and next stems from improvements in some large emerging market and low income economies that in 2016 were exceptionally stressed. That being said, compared to our view in October, we now think that more of the lift will come from better prospects in the United States, China, Europe, and Japan. A faster pace of expansion would be especially welcome this year: global growth in 2016 was the weakest since 2008'09, owing to a challenging first half marked initially by turmoil in world financial markets. General improvement got under way around mid-year. For example, broad indicators of manufacturing activity in emerging and advanced economies have been in expansionary territory and rising since early summer. In many countries, previous downward pressures on headline inflation weakened, in part owing to firming commodity prices. **A significant repricing of assets followed the U.S. presidential election.** Its most notable elements were a sharp increase in U.S. longer-term interest rates, equity market appreciation and higher long-term inflation expectations in advanced economies, and sharp movements in opposite directions of the dollar'up'and the yen'down. At the same time, emerging market equity markets broadly retreated as currencies weakened. Of course, asset markets adjust not just to unexpected current events, but to shifting expectations of future events. Most commentators have interpreted the post-election moves as predicting that U.S. fiscal policy will turn more expansionary and require a swifter pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Markets have noted that the White House and Congress are in the hands of the same party for the first time in six years, and that change points to lower tax rates and possibly higher infrastructure and defense spending. **In light of the U.S. economy's momentum coming into 2017, and the likely shift in policy mix, we have moderately raised our two-year projections for U.S. growth.** At this early stage, however, the specifics of future fiscal legislation remain unclear, as do the degree of net increase in government spending and the resulting impacts on aggregate demand, potential output, the Federal deficit, and the dollar. There is thus a wider than usual range of upside and downside risks to this forecast. A sustained non-inflationary growth increase, marked by higher labor force participation and significant expansion of the U.S. capital stock and infrastructure, would allow a more moderate pace of interest rate increases in line with the Federal Reserve's price stability mandate. On the downside, if a fiscally-driven demand increase collides with more rigid capacity constraints, a steeper path for interest rates will be necessary to contain inflation, the dollar will appreciate sharply, real growth will be lower, budget pressure will increase, and the U.S. current account deficit will widen. This last scenario, one with a widening of global imbalances, intensifies the risk of protectionist measures and retaliatory responses. It would also imply a faster than expected tightening of global financial conditions, with resulting possible stress on many emerging market and some low-income economies. Some emerging and especially low-income commodity exporters could benefit from higher export prices, but importers would then lose. The details of the U.S. policy mix matter; and as these become clearer, we will adjust our forecast and spillover assessment. **Among emerging economies, China remains a major driver of world economic developments.** Our China growth upgrade for 2017 is a key factor underpinning the coming year's expected faster global recovery. This change reflects an expectation of continuing policy support; but a sharp or disruptive slowdown in the future remains a risk given continuing rapid credit expansion, impaired corporate debts, and persistent government support for inefficient state-owned firms. At the global level, other vulnerabilities include higher popular antipathy toward trade, immigration, and multilateral engagement in the United States and Europe; widespread high levels of public and private debt; ongoing climate change'which especially affects low-income countries; and, in a number of advanced countries, continuing slow growth and deflationary pressures. In Europe, Britain's terms of exit from the European Union remain unsettled and the upcoming national electoral calendar is crowded, with possibilities of adverse economic repercussions, in the short and longer terms. **We continue to recommend a three-pronged policy approach relying on fiscal and structural policies alongside monetary policy**, but one that is tailored to country circumstances. Some advanced economies are now operating at close to full capacity, for example, Germany and the United States. In these, fiscal policy should focus, not on short-term demand support, but on increasing potential output through investments in needed infrastructure and skills, as well as supply-friendly, equitable tax reform. Policymakers in these economies should also turn their attention to longer-term fiscal sustainability, while monetary policy can follow a data-dependent normalizing path. Structural reform remains a priority everywhere in view of continuing tepid productivity growth, although in many cases appropriate fiscal support can raise the effectiveness of reforms without worsening governments' fiscal positions. Financial resilience is another universal priority and requires stronger financial regulatory frameworks, better focused on key problem areas. Countries can do much on their own to improve financial oversight and institutions, but not everything, and continuing multilateral financial regulatory cooperation is vital. **Social dislocation due to globalization and, even more, to technology change is a major challenge that will only intensify in the future.** One result has been wider inequality and wage stagnation in many countries. Rolling back economic integration, however, would impose aggregate economic costs without reducing the need for government investment in well-trained, nimble workforces, along with policies to promote better matching of available jobs to skills. On this Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States, we do well to acknowledge a key takeaway from 2016: sustainable growth must also be inclusive growth.

A new IMF analysis looks at ways to overcome obstacles._ The clock is now ticking on the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and while investment'critical to this agenda'has been rising in recent years among low-income countries, weak infrastructure is still hampering growth. Governments need to make significant improvements to lay foundations for flourishing economies: roads to connect people to markets, electricity to keep factories running, sanitation to stave off disease, and pipelines to deliver safe water. For that reason, upgrading and expanding transport, telecommunications and utilities is a key pillar in many countries' national development strategies. [ What are the challenges, and what needs to be done to achieve the goals in low-income states? A chapter in a [recent report by the IMF delves into these questions. **High debt, insufficient resources and capacity constraints ** In many low-income countries, public debt levels have risen and external financing conditions have tightened, which has made taking out loans to invest in infrastructure projects increasingly difficult and risky. During 2015 alone, the ratio of public debt to GDP rose from 34 to 42 percent. A survey reveals that the availability of external financing and administrative capacity constraints are key obstacles to scaling up public infrastructure investment in the most vulnerable countries. However, for low- income countries better connected to global capital markets, it is the sufficiency of domestic financial resources that is the most important concern. [ **Bridging the gap on multiple fronts ** Given their limited resources, poorer countries can benefit substantially from improving the efficiency of their public investment. As documented in the [IMF's recent analysis, value for money in public investment varies considerably among low-income countries, and is generally lower than in other states. While the broad principles for improving public investment efficiency'for example, that capital expenditure should go to most productive projects'are well understood, institutional mechanisms to achieve this (effective cost-benefit analysis; transparent procurement) are not always in place. More domestic resources from taxes can create more space for priority spending areas such as infrastructure. However, despite some progress, tax revenues still remain lower in poorer countries than elsewhere, partly due to lower collection efficiency. Therefore, improving tax administration, broadening the tax base, closing unjustified loopholes, streamlining expenditures, and, in some cases, raising tax rates will help generate the budgetary resources to fund infrastructure provision. [ Concessional financing will need to continue to play an important role in funding development in low-income countries. Increasing the capital of multilateral development banks and adjusting the way they deploy their capital could generate more resources for the poorest countries. The rise of new bilateral donors, particularly China, and new institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, has brought additional funds for development. That said, many potential donor countries are faced with their own fiscal challenges, limiting the prospects for a large increase in multilateral and bilateral donor financing. In any case, there is an [overall agreement that even scaled up official development assistance is insufficient to meet the investment requirements of the [Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. **Get the private sector involved ** There is little purely private infrastructure in low-income countries outside the mobile telecommunications sector'but that notable exception demonstrates that the model is potentially viable. Small-scale applications in other sectors, such as solar micro-grids, reinforce this notion. Alternatively, public and private capital can be combined in a public-private partnership, which is a relatively frequent model in electricity generation. Of course, a strong institutional framework and sound public-private partnership management are critical to avoid such structures unduly increasing fiscal risks. How to attract private investment in infrastructure? A favorable business environment, including stable macroeconomic conditions and predictable policies and regulations, tops the list. But it may not be sufficient. Numerous obstacles get in the way of connecting private investors to viable projects, even though large institutional pools of capital (close to $100 trillion in advanced economies) are looking for decent returns. In particular, there is limited expertise in low-income countries in structuring projects to ensure an acceptable risk-return combination for private investors. Multilateral development banks help developing countries address many of these issues. Numerous project preparation facilities help structure viable projects'for example, the recently established Global Infrastructure Facility with an initial capitalization of $100 million. In addition, development banks seek to catalyze private investment by providing risk mitigation through political risk insurance, credit guarantees, subordinated debt, and other instruments. This is a very promising direction, although progress has been limited so far. **The IMF has tools to help ** The IMF assists its members interested in scaling up infrastructure investment. Its Infrastructure Policy Support Initiative is a suite of tools that help countries evaluate the macroeconomic and financial implications of alternative investment programs and financing strategies and bolster institutional capacity in managing public investment. These tools have already been applied in a large number of countries, including Cambodia, Honduras, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Togo. The IMF also allocates one-fifth of its support for national capacity building to assistance in the areas of tax policy and administration, which are key to domestic revenue mobilization.

Emerging market currencies took a bit of a dive, but overall investors didn't overreact and run for the doors with their money. For the bigger picture, you can read IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld's[ blog that outlines how the U.S. election and Fed decision will impact the global economy. One aspect that makes emerging markets more vulnerable is their corporations are [loaded down with debt in both local and foreign currency'to the tune of roughly $18 trillion'fueled in large part by low interest rates in the United States. This debt now makes them vulnerable to the expected interest rate increases in 2017. Will firms be able to roll over their debt? **The debt balloon** The debt of nonfinancial firms in emerging markets has quadrupled over the past decade, with bonds accounting for a growing share (Chart 1). The considerable increase in corporate debt raises concerns, given the link between the rapid build-up in leverage in emerging markets and past financial crises. [ [Our new paper suggests that: * Debt accumulation was more pronounced for firms which are more dependent on external financing. Likewise, relative to other types of firms, small and medium-sized enterprises disproportionately increased their leverage. * The impact of U.S. monetary policy on debt growth was greater for sectors that are more heavily dependent on external funding in financially open emerging markets with relatively more rigid exchange rate regimes. * Global financial conditions affected emerging market firms' growth in debt in part by relaxing corporate borrowing constraints. **Where is debt highest** Corporate debt in emerging markets has climbed faster in more cyclical sectors, with the greatest growth seen in construction (Chart 2). The striking increase in leverage within the construction sector is most notable in China and Latin America. In addition, firms that took on more debt have, on average, also increased their foreign exchange exposures.

The [Financial Sector Assessment Program remains the IMF's principal tool for assessing countries' financial stability. It identifies weaknesses in a country's financial system that could threaten its stability, as well as strengths that make the system resilient. The IMF tailors country stability assessments to analyze issues of particular interest or concern in each country. In 2017, IMF teams of experts will focus on systemic risks, the health of banks, and contagion and spillover risks. For each economy, the IMF will make policy recommendations about how to: * Strengthen the monitoring of risks to the financial system as a whole * Improve financial oversight and the [macroprudential framework for financial system safety, and * Prepare for stressful financial conditions We have this handy [factsheet that explains the why and how of our financial assessments. You can also read more about why we assess [the 29 systemically important financial sectors every five years. Some highlights for countries under review in 2017 include: **China** Since the global financial crisis, China's growth has relied increasingly on credit, especially in the corporate sector, including state-owned enterprises, and in recent months also on mortgage lending. Tensions between sustaining growth and the need to contain indebtedness, together with certain financial sector innovations, have led to increased financial sector complexity and the risk of gaps in supervision. The IMF will examine these issues from a systemic point of view. **Indonesia** Financial conglomerates play a dominant role in the financial system and the economy, and account for 70 percent of the assets of financial institutions. The IMF will look closely at the oversight of financial conglomerates, and seek to identify areas for improvement in the newly implemented integrated supervisory framework, and the recently adopted law on crisis management and resolution. **Japan** Since the 2012 assessment, the profitability of financial institutions' domestic operations has weakened. This has prompted large banks and insurers to expand overseas in a search for higher yields, and smaller banks to increase their exposure to real estate and small and medium-sized enterprises. Against this background, the IMF will assess vulnerabilities associated with the international expansion of banks and insurers, as well as longer-term prospects for the financial sector in the context of demographic changes and low growth. **Luxembourg** Home to a key international central securities depository, Luxembourg has the world's second largest investment fund industry, and the profitability of its banking industry is tied to the general health of these funds. To address some of the systemic vulnerabilities, the IMF will use stress tests and spillover analysis to assess the ability of Luxembourg's financial institutions to absorb liquidity and/or solvency shocks. **Saudi Arabia** An extended period of low oil prices is affecting the Saudi economy. Although the bank-dominated financial sector has so far been resilient, this episode is an opportunity to complete the financial reform agenda and make improvements in the functioning of the interbank market that would also help banks diversify their funding sources over the longer term. These are the key issues the IMF will explore with officials. **Spain** The assessment will look at progress and improvements made since the crisis. It will tackle banks' ability to adjust to low profits due to their business models, and their ability to manage the post-crisis recovery. The IMF will also examine the emerging needs of the institutional framework, and apply enhanced methods to capture cross-border financial shocks, and account for the linkages between the economy and the financial system as a whole. **Zambia** Against a backdrop of declining economic growth due to sharply lower copper prices and an unsustainable fiscal deficit, the IMF will focus on how to maintain financial stability, including the adequacy of supervisory resources. It will also examine the adherence to international norms of the legal and regulatory framework for financial sector oversight. **Economies whose financial stability the IMF will assess during 2017:** 1. Bahrain 2. Bulgaria* 3. China* 4. Guyana* 5. India* 6. Indonesia* 7. Japan 8. Luxembourg 9. Netherlands 10. New Zealand 11. Saudi Arabia* 12. Spain 13. Turkey* 14.

While a decline in demand helped drive down the value of global imports and exports, consumer choice played an interesting part. In our December issue of _[Finance &amp; Development magazine_ we zoom in on one aspect of the story. Using [Argentine wine exports as an example, [Natalie Chen and Luciana Juvenal show that the nominal (before inflation) value of global trade fell also because consumers bought cheaper, lower-quality goods rather than more expensive, higher-quality products. **The pinch of recession** Chen and Juvenal show that because consumption of higher-quality goods is generally more sensitive to changes in income than that of lower-quality items, a sudden reduction in income may lead to a 'flight from quality.'\u009d This means households in crisis-hit countries reduce not only the quantity but also the quality of the goods they consume. This, in turn, should lead to a bigger contraction in higher- than in lower-quality imports. The authors investigate whether the global financial crisis induced such a flight from quality; in the case of wine made in Argentina, that turned out to be the case.

On average, the annual cost of disasters for small states (economies with a population of less than 1.5 million) is more than four times that for larger countries, in relation to GDP. These countries'whether landlocked nations or small island states'need a range of approaches to deal with catastrophe, including not only better disaster response but also more focus on risk reduction and preparedness. In a [new study, we look at the special challenges of small countries and show what countries and the international community can do to help prepare for disasters and cope once they strike. **Exposed to the elements** Visiting Fiji and Vanuatu on a recent trip to Asia, I was struck by the enormous size of the destruction the storms had caused, and the huge impact on their economies. What makes them so exposed? Many small states are located in high risk locations'zones subject to hurricanes, cyclones, and earthquakes. For example, in the Pacific, Vanuatu, which I just visited, experienced a devastating cyclone in 2015, while Samoa was similarly affected in 2013. And the Caribbean, Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have all seen major storm damage since 2010. For a country with a large land area, a disaster can severely impact one region, but leave large parts of the economy untouched. But, when a small island is hit by a cyclone, virtually all of its crops, housing, and other infrastructure can be destroyed. This magnifies the size of the disaster relative to the size of the economy and its resources. Administrative capacity is also an issue in small countries, which tend to have less income and fewer public employees for risk management programs. Moreover, three out of four small states are islands or widely dispersed multi-island states. These small island economies are highly vulnerable to the rising sea levels associated with climate change. These vulnerabilities entail significant costs, our analysis finds. Nearly one in ten disasters causes damage amounting to more than 30 percent of GDP, compared to fewer than one in a hundred for larger states. The average annual cost of disasters for small states is nearly 2 percent of GDP. This greater exposure to natural disasters inevitably worsens public finances, reduces investment and growth prospects, and increases poverty. To make matters worse, one-third of small states will be highly vulnerable to climate change within a generation. And these countries typically do not have the resources to invest in the costly projects needed to help them adapt to climate change. **Building resilience** How can governments mitigate the effects of natural disasters? Countries can take a number of proactive steps to reduce the human and economic cost of natural disasters. These include identifying and quantifying key aspects that make them vulnerable, and then investing in risk reduction infrastructure and projects. They should develop contingency action plans and financing arrangements for risks they cannot avoid. The IMF can help countries with the economic aspects of disaster risk management. For example, to design frameworks for managing the budget, public investments, and public borrowing. We can also share best practices and build policymakers' capacity in these areas. I saw firsthand in Suva, Fiji, the work our Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center is already doing in this area. But it is impossible to avoid risk entirely, so when disaster strikes, countries have recourse to IMF financing. Our [Rapid Credit Facility and [Rapid Financing Instrument, which small states have already used, provide quick access to financing following disasters. Vanuatu tapped these funds in 2015 following Cyclone Pam, for example, and Samoa borrowed from both (in 2009 after an earthquake and tsunami and in 2013 after a cyclone). Other small states, such as Dominica, have done so on multiple occasions (four times over the period 2008-2015). We are looking to further strengthen our support to small states through these financing instruments. But current annual borrowing limits for these facilities are small in relation to the disasters these countries can potentially face. That's why our Executive Board recently indicated that it would consider higher access limits for countries subject to particularly large disasters starting in early 2017. We can also work with small states as they contribute to confronting climate change under the [Paris Agreement. Macroeconomic policies can play an important role in national plans for mitigating carbon emissions through carbon taxation and energy subsidy reforms. They can also help the process of adjusting to climate change by efficiently managing costly public risk reduction investments. On a pilot basis, the IMF is ready to conduct assessments of the macroeconomic aspects of climate change policies of small states. These assessments could help showcase small states' policy efforts and improve their access to global climate funding. We also will continue to communicate and collaborate closely with the World Bank and other organizations with critical expertise on natural disasters and climate change that can complement our macroeconomic engagement. Given the utter unpredictability of natural disasters, the IMF is committed to be agile in its response to the members' changing needs.

Economies that rely more on importing commodities saw about a 2 percent of GDP benefit from the 2015 drop in prices.

The Fed's action was hardly a surprise: markets had for weeks placed a high probability on last week's move. But market developments preceding the Fed decision did surprise many market watchers. Especially striking were the sharp upward moves in longer-term U.S. interest rates, the dollar, and market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations soon after the U.S. presidential and congressional elections of November 8. No comparably abrupt market reactions preceded the Fed's previous interest rate hike of December 2015 (see chart). The dollar has risen further in the days following the Fed's recent move. [ Time will tell if these market developments point to a new trend. Most likely, however, the election marks a shift in the U.S. policy regime with potentially even bigger future effects on prices and activity'abroad, as well as in the United States. Spillovers outside the United States will be felt especially strongly in emerging market economies, where for some, the advantages of enhanced competitiveness due to weaker currencies may be finely balanced against vulnerabilities. **Something has changed** From the start of 2016 and through the U.S. election, Treasury yields had been particularly low. Discussion of the global outlook, including at the IMF, stressed the risks of protracted low growth and continuing deflation pressures'even [secular stagnation, with persistently low interest rates. Longer-term nominal interest rates are, however, strongly influenced by expectations of the future path of the Fed's policy rate, which in turn responds to U.S. inflation pressures and the economy's underlying strength. Thus, the sharp post-election turnaround in longer-term U.S. interest rates changed the conversation: it likely reflected not the looming December rate hike alone, which was already widely anticipated, but also a shift in expectations about the future interest rate path and future demand in the U.S. economy. Consistent with those expectations, while last week's interest-rate hike was itself not unexpected, the _future _path of interest rates that Federal Open Market Committee members anticipate also steepened, and now suggests three interest rate hikes in each of the next two years. The timing of the abrupt asset-price movements'coming within days of the U.S. election'is the key clue about what moved markets. The election of Donald Trump as president, coupled with continuing Republican control of the Congress, ended six years of divided U.S. government. **Implications for the future** Republicans in Congress have long advocated lower personal and corporate tax rates. President-elect Trump campaigned on a platform that included not only substantial tax cuts, but also increases in some categories of government spending, notably defense and infrastructure. At this early stage, it is hard to know precisely how the shift in fiscal policy will look. One thing seems clear, however: it will turn more expansionary through some combination of more spending and lower tax rates. In general, any increase in U.S. aggregate demand will generate some rise in real output'as new workers are hired, others work longer hours, and machinery is used more intensively'and some upward pressure on inflation. With the overall unemployment rate at 4.6 percent and other measures of labor market distress largely recovered from the financial crisis eight years ago, there could be little remaining slack in the U.S. economy. Unless labor force participation and overtime work rise significantly, there is a chance that inflation pressure therefore rises noticeably. This seems to be what the Fed has in mind when it predicts it will raise the federal funds rate more quickly. More rapidly rising U.S. interest rates signal further dollar appreciation. Tax incentives for U.S. corporation to repatriate their past profits held abroad, which some estimate at $2.5 trillion, could also push the dollar up. Given faster demand growth, the outcome will be a widening U.S. current account deficit, that is, more borrowing from abroad. Some of it will possibly finance a growing Federal fiscal deficit, depending on the precise features of the U.S. fiscal package, the extent to which it is paid for by budget cuts elsewhere, the path of government borrowing rates, and the economy's growth response. U.S. growth will respond more strongly, with lower inflation, if any infrastructure spending is carefully designed to boost potential output, while tax measures encourage investment, labor supply, and inclusion. **International challenges ahead** Given the United States' central role in the world economy, big changes in its policy mix have first-order effects beyond its borders. Advanced economies with currencies that depreciate against the dollar will benefit both from higher U.S. growth and from more competitive exchange rates. For most of these economies, currently struggling with below-target inflation, any resulting inflationary pressure would (at least initially) be welcome. They may also see upward pressure on interest rates, posing a fiscal challenge for countries that are highly indebted but do not benefit enough from the positive demand spillovers that are driving their interest rates upward. Emerging market economies can also benefit from more competitive currencies and higher U.S. demand. But although many emerging market economies have increased their policy buffers (e.g., foreign reserves), reduced currency mismatches, and improved financial oversight frameworks, some could still feel stress, especially where there are pre-existing political or economic strains. Historically, U.S. interest rates have been one of the key drivers of net capital flows into emerging market economies. Flexible exchange rates can be helpful as a buffer against rapid outflows, as they allow international portfolios to rebalance through currency changes rather than reserve losses. A combination of rising dollar interest rates and domestic currency depreciation could reduce liquidity or worsen balance sheets, however, especially given the importance of dollar borrowing by residents and non-resident corporates in emerging market economies. Furthermore, currency depreciation might spark higher inflation. Policymakers in emerging markets therefore will remain vigilant. If sharp exchange rate shifts and growing global imbalances follow the U.S. policy regime change, protectionist pressures become a major risk, as in past similar circumstances. Given the desire of advanced economy governments to maintain manufacturing, where emerging markets have made big inroads in recent decades, it is most likely that emerging market economies are the main targets for higher trade barriers erected by advanced economies. Governments should therefore keep in mind that protection is likely to be [counterproductive at home'even before trade partners retaliate, as they will be tempted to do. The integration of advanced economies into truly global supply chains underscores this danger. In an environment of sharply divergent policy mixes, as we may now be facing, the rules of the global trading system will be more important than ever.

Maliszewski Version in [\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6?? (Chinese) China urgently needs to tackle its corporate-debt problem before it becomes a major drag on growth in the world's No. 2 economy. Corporate debt has reached very high levels and continues to grow. In our recent [paper, we recommend that the government act promptly to adopt a comprehensive program that would sacrifice some economic growth in the short term while rapidly returning the economy to a sustainable growth path. Let's first take a look at the dimensions of the problem. From 2009 to 2015, credit grew very rapidly by 20 percent on average per year, much more than growth in nominal gross domestic product. What's more, the ratio of non- financial private credit to GDP rose from around 150 percent to more than 200 percent, or about 20-25 percentage points higher than the historical trend. Such a 'credit gap'\u009d is comparable to those in countries that experienced painful deleveraging, such as Spain, Thailand, and Japan (see Chart 1). [ This corporate credit boom reflected the government efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the global financial crisis, largely through lending for infrastructure and real estate. The outcome: overbuilding and a severe overhang of unsold properties, especially in lower-tier cities, along with excess capacity in related industries such as steel, cement and coal. The combination of heavy borrowing and falling profits led to excessive debt loads. The problem has been worst among state-owned enterprises that benefit from preferential access to financing and implicit government guarantees, which lower the cost of borrowing. **High-level decision ** So what is the solution? First, the government should make a high-level decision to stop financing weak companies, strengthen corporate governance, mitigate social costs and accept likely slower growth in the near term. It needs buy-in at every level'state-owned enterprises, local governments, and financial supervisors. Here are the other steps China's government can take: * **Triage: **Identify companies in financial difficulty and distinguish between those that should be restructured and those \"zombie\" companies that have no hope of survival and that should be allowed to exit. Because of the existing links between state-owned banks and corporations, a new agency could be created to perform this role. * **Recognize losses:** Require banks to recognize and manage impaired assets. So-called shadow banks'trust, securities and asset-management companies'should also be forced to recognize losses. * **Share the burden:** Allocate losses among banks, corporates, investors and, if necessary, the government. * **Harden budget constraints'especially on state owned enterprises'**by improving corporate governance and removing implicit guarantees to prevent further misallocation of credit and losses. To make the program work and limit the short-term economic pain, other supportive measures are needed: * **Improve the legal framework for insolvency: **But large-scale and expedited restructuring also requires out-of-court mechanisms to complement the existing framework. * **Ease the transition:** Broaden unemployment insurance coverage, provide income support for displaced workers and help them find new jobs. The social safety net should be improved because closing or restructuring loss-making companies in industries such as coal and steel could result in substantial layoffs. * **Facilitate market entry: **Dismantle monopolies in services such as telecommunications and health care and foster greater competition. * **Improve local government finance:** Ensure sufficient taxing powers and revenue sources for local governments to discourage off-balance-sheet borrowing. Risks appear manageable if the problem is addressed promptly. Indeed, it is encouraging that the government has recognized the problem and is taking action to address it. The comprehensive strategy we have outlined would allow China to reduce leverage, limit vulnerabilities, and return to a strong and sustainable growth path over the medium term.

And it's not just about more spending; it's about smart spending. This is something that the IMF has urged countries to consider for several years, starting with our Fall 2014 _[World Economic Outlook_. Bridges, roads, and highways, along with telecoms, ports and airports are all part of the backbone that supports a country's growth and the global economy. Investing in building schools, public housing and hospitals, known as social infrastructure, can provide a powerful impetus for economic activity and jobs in countries. Canada and the United Kingdom have announced and begun plans to invest billions in the coming years to fix and modernize their infrastructure, sorely in need of an upgrade. The incoming U.S. Administration has also indicated its intention to increase investment in infrastructure. For the past several years, the IMF has analyzed the data and produced new research on the benefits and best way to spend taxpayer dollars on infrastructure. With interest rates still low, the IMF research suggests that debt-financed investment could virtually pay for itself by boosting demand in the short run and productivity in the long run. But that comes with a caveat: the quality of investment matters. So countries should invest well, where there is a clear need, and invest efficiently.

Thomsen Greece is once again in the headlines as discussions for the second review of its European Stability Mechanism (ESM) program are gaining pace. Unfortunately, the discussions have also spurred some misinformation about the role and the views of the IMF. Above all, the IMF is being criticized for demanding more fiscal austerity, in particular for making this a condition for urgently needed debt relief. This is not true, and clarifications are in order. **The IMF is not demanding more austerity**. On the contrary, when the Greek Government agreed with its European partners in the context of the ESM program to push the Greek economy to a primary fiscal surplus of 3.5 percent by 2018, we warned that this would generate a degree of austerity that could prevent the nascent recovery from taking hold. We projected that the measures in the ESM program will deliver a surplus of only 1.5 percent of GDP, and said this would be enough for us to support a program. We did not call for additional measures to achieve a higher surplus. But contrary to our advice, the Greek Government agreed with the European institutions to temporarily compress spending further if needed to ensure that the surplus would reach 3.5 percent of GDP. We have not changed our view that Greece does not need more austerity at this time. Claiming that it is the IMF who is calling for this turns the truth upside down. **Making the Greek budget more growth-friendly and fair** But this does not mean that there is no further work for Greece to do on the fiscal side. Greece still needs to reform the structure of its taxes and spending'how the government raises its money and what it spends it on'because both are highly unfriendly to growth and equity. But the point of the measures we are calling for is not to generate more austerity and a higher primary surplus. _To the contrary, the gains from these reforms should be used fully to increase spending or cut taxes to support growth_. In our view, reforms like those we propose are indispensable: we do not believe that Greece can come close to sustaining even a modest primary surplus and realize its ambitious long-term growth target without a radical restructuring of the public sector. This should not'and cannot'happen overnight, but it is critical that a plan to create a more growth-friendly and equitable structure of the public finances over the medium term is adopted now. Why is the currently agreed budget unfriendly to growth? While Greece has undertaken a huge fiscal adjustment, it has increasingly done so without addressing two key problems'an income tax regime that exempts more than half of households from any obligation (the average for the rest of the Euro Zone is 8 percent) and an extremely generous pension system that costs the budget nearly 11 percent of GDP annually (versus the average for the rest of the Euro Zone of 2\u00c2? percent of GDP). Instead of tackling these difficult problems, Greece has resorted to deep cuts in investment and so-called discretionary spending. It has done so to such an extent that decaying infrastructure is hampering growth and the delivery of basic public services such as transportation and health care is being compromised. We think that these cuts have already gone too far, but the ESM program assumes even more of them, with an increase in the primary surplus to 3.5 percent of GDP achieved through further cuts in investment and discretionary spending. Perhaps through a Herculean effort Greece could manage the spending cuts needed to achieve a 3.5 percent of GDP deficit in the short run. But experience has shown that they cannot be sustained and are inconsistent with Greece's ambitious long-term growth target. Greece's economy needs far-reaching modernization across the board. Above all, Greece does not have the kind of unemployment compensation and other well- targeted social benefits that are commonplace elsewhere in Europe and that are critical for broad social support in a modern market-oriented economy. A case in point is the Government's reluctance to lift the restriction on collective dismissals'an outdated pre-approval requirement that does not exist in most other European countries. Its hesitation comes not because the dismissal restriction is a good idea in itself, but because Greece has no adequate unemployment compensation. Rather than provide support to dismissed workers, the government instead restricts the ability of firms to dismiss them. Simply put, Greece cannot modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest European countries. **A path forward that adds up** What are the implications for debt relief? Greece's debt is highly unsustainable and no amount of structural reforms will make it sustainable again without significant debt relief. Similarly, no amount of debt relief will allow Greece to return to robust growth without reforms. But since the higher the primary surplus that Greece maintains, the lower the amount of debt relief to ensure debt sustainability, the question is how to distribute the burden between Greece and its partners. We have suggested that the primary surplus target used to calibrate debt relief be set at 1.5 percent of GDP. But we recognize that member states' reluctance to accept this (and the resulting additional need for debt relief) is rooted in the reality that some of them will themselves have to run higher primary surpluses than proposed for Greece, while others provide less generous pension benefits and tax exemptions than does Greece. The Euro Zone is not a full political union, and we realize that a solution will have to be politically acceptable to 19 sovereign member states. A compromise between the Greeks and their European partners may therefore have to involve a higher primary surplus for a while, although this would not be our first choice. But while we can be flexible for the short term about how the burden is divided between the Greeks and their European partners, the solution needs to add up in a credible manner. Having argued above that not even a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP is consistent with strong growth without pension and tax reforms to make the budget much more growth friendly and fair, it should be obvious that pushing the budget to a surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP will take an even larger toll on growth. It will reduce demand in the short run'which is why we would in any case not recommend increasing the surplus above 1.5 percent of GDP until the recovery has taken better hold. And it will weigh on medium-term growth by delaying the onset of the needed implementation of a more growth friendly budget. Thus, an open-ended long-term commitment to very high surpluses is simply not credible. Should Greece and its European partners agree on a short-term surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP, however, two aspects are relevant for the IMF. First, there needs to be a credible plan how to push the surplus beyond 1.5 percent of GDP. This would require significant additional measures that are not yet in place. And second, credibility requires that these additional measures are legislated upfront to leave no doubt about Greece's political resolve to overcome the resistance from vested interests that have hampered program implementation in the past. In conclusion, it is not the IMF that is demanding more austerity, either now or as a means to lower the need for debt relief over the medium-term. Or to be more direct, if Greece agrees with its European partners on ambitious fiscal targets, don't criticize the IMF for being the ones insisting on austerity when we ask to see the measures required to make such targets credible. _Read this [note for a more detailed explanation of why the current Greek budget is unfriendly to growth and equity, and why solving this problem requires tax and pension reforms.

In other words, their populations are aging. And graying populations pose serious issues for people, policymakers, and society. Health care costs rise, mainly because older people need more of it. Pension payments'whether from public or private plans'also increase at the same time there are relatively fewer younger workers paying into the pension systems. And there are also fewer people producing goods and services relative to the total population. The old-age dependency ratio'the number of people over 65 divided by the number of people between 15 and 64'rises. In other words, there are economic strains and many countries that haven't faced them yet will soon. One way to alleviate those strains would be to increase the amount of goods and services each worker produces'that is to boost productivity. Productivity is a major driver of economic growth. When it is rising, more goods and services are produced from the same amount of input'giving society more output to divvy up. When productivity is falling, GDP growth is retarded. **How aging affects productivity** But two recent papers by IMF economists suggest that there are limited prospects for productivity to come to the rescue. That's because not only is the overall population aging, so are those still in the workforce. And the aging workforce is holding down productivity growth in both [Europe and [Japan. The decline in productivity in Japan and Europe manifested itself in what economists call Total Factor Productivity, which is the portion of economic growth that is not the result of changes in inputs (such as capital and labor). Total factor productivity measures how efficiently capital and labor are used in the production process and is affected by such things as innovation, institutions and the quality of the workforce. Productivity generally increases until workers are in their 40s, then tails off until they stop working. In Japan, for example, workers in the 40 to 49 age group were the most productive, with productivity declining after that. Authors Yihan Liu and Niklas Westelius calculated that the aging workforce could have reduced Japan's annual total factor productivity growth by as much as 0.7'0.9 percentage points between 1990 and 2005. The decline was largely due to the reduction in the 40 to 49 age group. Starting in 2010, the 40 to 49 group increased a bit, but after 2025 shifts in the working age population age will again reduce total factor productivity growth. The story is similar for 28 countries in Europe. Authors Shekhar Aiyar, Christian Ebeke, and Xiabo Shao [found that the growing number of workers aged 55 and older on average 'lowered total factor productivity growth by about 0.1 percentage points each year over the past two decades.'\u009d But that varied across countries. In Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, the Netherlands, and Germany, workforce aging shaved about 0.2 percentage points off annual total factor productivity growth. **Future could be worse** Under current demographic projections, the future will be worse. From 2014 to 2045 workforce aging will intensify in Europe and could reduce annual total factor productivity growth by 0.2 percentage points. But in countries where aging will be most pronounced'Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain'annual total factor productivity growth could be reduced by as much as 0.6 percentage points. Aiyar, Ebeke, and Shao write that some of the effects of total factor productivity erosion from workforce aging might be offset in Europe by such policies as: * Broadening access to medical services to improve the overall population health; * Improving workforce training; * Reforming labor markets to make it easier for older workers to change jobs; and * Promoting technological innovation to improve overall productivity'among other things, through increased spending on research and development. To the extent that such changes (for example, devices that reduce physical labor associated with manufacturing) disproportionately benefit senior workers, they could mitigate the adverse effects of an aging workforce on total factor productivity growth.

The IMF's [Global House Price Index, a simple average of real house prices for 57 countries, is now almost back to its level before the crisis (Chart 1). Is it time to [worry again about a global fall in house prices? [ The classic study of financial crises by Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff has taught us the folly of claiming '[this time is different.'\u009d Still, there are several reasons to think that the present conjuncture is a [time for vigilance but not panic. * First, unlike the boom of the 2000s, the current boom in house prices is not synchronized across countries. And within countries, the boom is often restricted to one or a few cities. In many cases, the booms are not being driven by strong credit growth: some house price increases, particularly at the city level, are due to supply constraints. * Second, countries are now more active in the use of macroprudential policies to tame housing booms. As our former Deputy Managing Director Min Zhu declared: 'The [era of benign neglect of house price booms is over.'\u009d **Lack of synchronicity ** A closer look at the global index reveals three clusters of countries (Chart 2, left panel). * The first cluster'**gloom**'consists of 18 economies in which house prices fell substantially during the global financial crisis and have remained on a downward path. * The second'**bust and boom**'consists of 18 economies in which housing markets have rebounded since 2013 after falling sharply during 2007-12. * The third'**boom**'comprises 21 economies in which the drop in house prices in 2007'12 was quite modest and was followed by a quick rebound. Not only are there differences across countries, but the situation differs within countries. [China offers a good example. While land prices overall have kept up a steady upward march, this masks tremendous variation at the city level.

With his co-authors, Gyourko has constructed a residential land price index for 35 large cities in China based on government sales of land to private developers. These data show that prices have increased in inflation-adjusted terms by about 25 percent a year in Beijing over the past decade but by under 10 percent a year in Xian. Whether this pattern of price increases will continue depends on the balance between supply and demand, which varies across cities as well. Some other examples are those of Amsterdam, Oslo, and Vienna, where house prices are rising far more than the national averages. [ **Supply constraints ** Many of the past housing booms were driven by excessive credit growth. But this time supply constraints appear to be playing a big role in driving some of the price booms. Residential permits have grown only modestly in the \"boom\" and \"bust and boom\" country clusters (Chart 2, right panel). The impact of supply constraints is evident in the case of many of cities. In Copenhagen and Stockholm, the increase in the housing stock has not kept up with population growth, feeding some of the price increase observed there. In recent years, the IMF has also flagged the role of supply constraints in some cities in [Australia and [Canada, as well as in many European ", "index": 57}, {"pub": "12/6/2016", "title": "Going with the Flow: Benefits of Capital Inflows for Emerging Markets", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=15680", "content": " By [Deniz Igan Michael Mussa, a former Chief Economist of the IMF, famously likened capital account liberalization to fire. In his comments at the IMF Economic Forum on October 2, 1998, he said: 'Fire warms our homes, it cooks our food, our internal combustion engines,'\u009d and continued: 'No doubt, fire is very useful, and we are not going to give up its manifold benefits. On the other hand, fire can also burn you down and do a great deal of damage.'\u009d As the Asian crisis unfolded, most perspectives on capital flows unsurprisingly took them more as a curse than as a blessing. Such views were reinforced with the reversal of international capital flows that followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the [association between how much a country suffered during the global financial crisis and its pre-crisis dependence on external financing. As international capital flows recovered, the policy [discussion focused on the possible problems the surge in capital inflows could cause for emerging market economies and how policymakers can and should manage inflows. **New micro evidence to answer an age-old question** In our [recent work, we take a step back and look at the other side of the coin: are capital inflows a blessing in that they enhance growth? An extensive literature has attempted to answer this question, and found little conclusive evidence that capital inflows yield significant benefits. The lack of such evidence in studies based on aggregate macro data, however, likely reflects the fact that different types of capital flows have different effects on growth. Moreover, a range of important factors'such as the quality of institutions and the strength of financial frictions'are difficult to capture in cross-country regressions. In our study, we use micro data at the industry level to fill in these gaps and provide some new evidence on the nexus between capital inflows and growth in emerging market economies. Specifically, we examine the association between capital inflows and industry growth in a sample of 22 emerging market economies from 1998 to 2010. **Not all industries and flows are created equal** Our empirical approach exploits the differences across industries in their need for external financing to distinguish any causal impact of capital inflows on output and value added. In principle, capital inflows have the potential to increase access to finance (quantity) and reduce interest rates (cost of borrowing), and hence we expect industries more dependent on external finance (e.g., chemical industry) to grow disproportionately faster than their counterparts (e.g., textile industry) if they are located in countries hosting more capital inflows. We also go beyond the existing literature by shedding light on the potential tradeoffs associated with capital inflows by investigating their impact on both growth and growth volatility in industrial sectors. In addition, we break down the total capital inflows to sub-components and test whether there are varying effects across different forms of capital flows. And finally, we explore to what extent the performance of domestic financial markets shapes the real effects of foreign capital inflows and what happens when there are large shocks to financial markets. **Fire _is_ useful, and so is fire safety ** As expected, more external finance dependent industries in countries that host more capital inflows grow disproportionately faster. Interestingly, this is the case in the pre-crisis period of 1998'2007, and the positive association is driven by debt, rather than equity, inflows. We also observe a reduction in output volatility, but this association is more pronounced for equity, rather than debt, inflows. These relationships, however, break down during the crisis. This is likely because large shocks to the global financial system are disruptive and hurt the ability of emerging market firms to turn capital inflows to investment and output. In line with this observation, the inflows- growth nexus is stronger in countries with well-functioning banks. The findings point to the need to take the composition of capital inflows into account when assessing their costs and benefits. They also hint at the importance of a well-functioning global financial system as well as the domestic banking system for emerging markets to harness the growth benefits of capital inflows. Getting the right 'fire safety measures'\u009d in place can help improve the trade-off that may be associated with capital inflow surges.

No longer prepared to take experts and elites at their word, many voters appear to be rejecting the adverse consequences of globalization by casting their ballot for antiestablishment messages and candidates. 'I've had five places shut down on me or have forced reductions in my working career,'\u009d says John Powers, a former machinery repairman from the United States, who appears on our cover.

IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld takes a [closer look at trade. While the immense wealth-creating gains from trade are clear, steady globalization since the early 1990s coupled with low economic growth since the financial crisis have left many individuals and communities behind. 'Globalization offers the potential of economic gains for all, but there is no guarantee that potential will be realized absent decisive government action to support those who suffer from the side effects,'\u009d he concludes.

Almost every type of regime can be found in the region: from floating and inflation targeting over various pegs to the unilateral use of the euro and full euro area membership. Why do CESEE's monetary regimes differ so much from one another, and how have they performed? Looking forward, how can they help countries address the economic challenges they are likely to face? If a country's current regime seems suboptimal, could it switch to a more suitable one, and if so, how? A [new paper by the IMF's European Department tackles these questions. This is a good time to take stock: in the past 15 years or so, CESEE went through a large boom-bust- recovery cycle, with a capital-flow-fueled boom in the early and mid-2000s, a sharp recession after the 2008 global financial crisis, and finally a gradual recovery. This allows analyzing monetary regimes' performance in a variety of challenging circumstances. **What do we find?** **First_, _the boom and bust were, in general, less pronounced in economies with flexible exchange rates,** with a more muted pre-2008 boom, followed by a shorter and shallower recession, and a more robust recovery. We spell out the full mechanism underlying these developments in the paper. But in short, flexible exchange rates tended to mitigate the impact of capital in- and outflows, while fixed exchange rates magnified them (see Chart 1). That fixed exchange rates can amplify capital flows through pro-cyclical credit booms is [well documented for emerging economies, and it clearly shows up in CESEE. [ **Second, excessive boom and bust continues to affect economies long after these episodes have ended.** As a result, **_potential_** growth in economies with fixed exchange rates is now, on average, almost a percentage point below that of economies with flexible exchange rates, as high private sector debt accumulated during the boom weighs on investment (see Chart 2). [ **But third, and importantly, this does _not_ mean that countries with fixed exchange rates simply chose the wrong regime.** Fixed exchange rates are there for a reason. For CESEE, we can trace their existence back to experiences with hyperinflation during the 1990s (see Chart 3). Wherever populations suffered hyperinflation, they continue to distrust local currencies to this day. Among other things, [they are much more likely to hold bank deposits in euros. In such an environment, tying the currency to a strong anchor like the euro provides stability and can instill confidence'and this can be more important than better managing credit cycles. [ **What does this suggest for exchange rate policy going forward? **For countries with flexible exchange rates, we see little need for reorientation'their regimes have generally served them well (while, of course, good economic management across the full range of policy tools'monetary, fiscal and structural policies'will remain critical to good economic performance). But what can countries with fixed exchange rate regimes do to achieve more balanced growth without ceding stability? We sketch **two strategies:** **'\u00a2 The first is to gradually increase exchange rate flexibility_._** But this is **_not_** an easy option, given especially the hyperinflation legacy. International experience suggests that a switch requires strong macroeconomic policies, regulatory measures that encourage the use of the domestic currency, and an extended period of low inflation, solid growth and exchange rate appreciation that solidifies confidence in the domestic currency. How feasible this strategy is depends on country circumstances. Some CESEE countries may have sufficiently strong institutions by now to transition'but others will likely need the fixed exchange rate as stability anchor for some time. Further, for countries that expect to adopt the euro soon, the upfront costs of transitioning to more flexibility may not be worthwhile. **European institutions could help,** through greater acceptance of prudential measures that promote the use of local currencies'instead of interpreting these as quasi-capital controls inconsistent with the European treaties. And a financial safety net during the transition to flexibility'for example in the form of unsecured European Central Bank swap lines'could help overcome the populations' entrenched distrust in floating currencies. **'\u00a2 A second option is to make existing fixed exchange rate regimes work better_._ **This requires high wage flexibility and a much stronger use of countercyclical fiscal and macro-prudential policies. But this is not easy to realize either. Running a [countercyclical fiscal policy is challenging for emerging economies, reflecting low fiscal multipliers, financing constraints, and political economy pressures. And [macro-prudential policies that put restrictions on bank lending suffer from evasion, with banks circumventing regulations in one country by providing loans cross-border from another. Thus, effective macro-prudential measures require a coordinated European anti-evasion effort. **To summarize, the diversity of exchange rate regimes in CESEE reflects in large measure different habitats. **One type of exchange rate regime is not inherently better than another'suitability depends on local conditions. But as in the natural world, regimes need to evolve as conditions change, otherwise their economies risk falling behind.

(Japanese) Japan's minimum wage is 798 JPY ($6.52) per hour, lower than many other advanced countries, including the United States, and among the lowest relative to the average wage (see chart). For a country that needs consumers to boost spending to pull the economy out of 15 years of deflation and reinvigorate growth, a hike in wages across the board can go a long way. This is especially the case for Japan, where there is a deep-rooted deflationary mindset and a large gap in wages and job security between regular and non-regular employees (part-timers, contract workers and temporary staff). The authorities have recognized the need for [policies that stimulate wage growth to help Japan's reflationary efforts, as well as counter the stagnation of incomes at the bottom. They have put in place plans to increase the minimum wage by 3 percent on a yearly basis, which would result in a hike from 798 PY to over 1,000 JPY per hour by the year 2023. In our recent [paper, we assess the impact of the government's 3 percent policy on average wage growth. [ **Impact of the 3 percent policy** We find that an increase in minimum wages in Japan not only affects those who are working below or at the current minimum wage level'which is estimated around 10 percent of the working population'but it also increases average wage growth through various channels. Suppose a firm now has to increase a worker's pay from $7 to $8 an hour. In a competitive market, most business owners would lay off these workers to cut costs. But in Japan, given the current tight labor market, with record low unemployment and record high labor shortages, Japanese firms are more likely to retain these workers who are currently working below the new minimum wage. Or they might try to substitute them with more skilled workers who can command even [higher wages. In either case, the effect on average wages would be positive. Our research further explains this outcome, by looking at data for seventeen years (from 1997 to 2014), and confirms that the planned 3 percent policy would result in an additional 0.5 percent increase in average wages per year. **Complementary policies needed** While an additional 0.5 percent per year would be a significant boost, it would still fall short of what Japan needs to escape deflation. Given the Bank of Japan's inflation target of 2 percent, and assuming productivity growth of 1 percent, wages would need to grow by at least 3 percent to have an impact. Our analysis therefore suggests that while the increase in minimum wage policy announced by the authorities is helpful in stimulating wage growth, it should be complemented by higher public wage increases and stronger inducements to raise private wages. Still, these income policies alone are unlikely to revitalize the economy. Japan needs structural reforms together with an appropriate monetary and fiscal policy mix'part of what the IMF has dubbed the '[reload'\u009d package. In this regard, measures to reduce labor market duality of regular and non-regular workers and give more bargaining power to workers would be key. In addition, to take full advantage of the effect of wage increases, policymakers need to remove remaining distortions in the tax and social security system that discourage full time work, mostly of women. The encouraging thing is that all these issues are on the table for discussion. We hope that the authorities will move on these with the same resolve with which they are implementing their minimum wage plan.

But Argentina is also famous for being home to some of the most diverse and extreme landscapes of the world'from subtropical rainforests and Iguazu Falls in the north to the glaciers of Perito Moreno in the south, and from the lowest site in South America (Laguna del Carb\u00c3\u00b3n) to the highest elevation in the Americas (Aconcagua mountain). Argentina's economy, much as its landscape, has tended to experience extreme swings. There have been a number of economic and financial crises over the years, including the one in 2001, which for its severity can be compared to the U.S. Great Depression. As the IMF returned to Argentina in September 2016 for the first [economic assessment since 2006 (known as the Article IV consultation), it found its authorities engaged in an ambitious transition to a more stable and sustainable economy, one that could minimize the risk of future extreme fluctuations of the country's economic landscape. **In the right direction** To understand the complexity of the transition, it may be useful to go back to December 2015, just after the elections that marked a surprise victory for the coalition led by Mauricio Macri. By then, Argentina had very low foreign exchange reserves, a severely overvalued exchange rate, a high fiscal deficit largely financed with monetary transfers from the central bank, one of the highest inflation rates in the world, rising trade and current account deficits, an extensive network of trade barriers and foreign exchange restrictions, the lowest investment rate in Latin America, and no access to international capital markets following the decade-long litigation with the hold-out creditors. Pervasive government intervention had severely weakened the country's institutions and undermined the credibility of economic and social indicators produced by the national statistical agency. The new administration had little choice but to begin unraveling the numerous imbalances and distortions. After the government's first year, much has been achieved: the complete dismantling of foreign exchange controls, the adoption of inflation targeting with a freely floating exchange rate, the first steps in bringing utility tariffs closer to international prices, a successful return to international capital markets after the quick settlement of the decade-long dispute with holdout creditors, and good progress in improving the governance environment. These measures included a complete overhaul of the national statistical agency, which led to the dissemination of new and credible official statistics (and, as a result, the removal of the IMF's [Declaration of Censure in early November). On the other hand, the federal authorities chose a cautious approach to lower the fiscal deficit, largely based on a very gradual reduction of energy subsidies, also reflecting the weakening economy (which has been contracting since the last quarter of 2015). **Completing the transition** While Argentina's progress achieved so far is impressive, much remains to be done to complete the transition to a more stable economic environment and restore robust, sustained, and equitable growth, while protecting the poor from the unavoidable costs of the adjustment. The IMF's [economic assessment of Argentina focused on the key policy priorities to continue along this path and has three main recommendations: * **Progress in reducing the fiscal deficit should continue, at a pace consistent with the need to minimize the impact on the most vulnerable, and be based on reallocating spending and rationalizing the tax system.** Although a more frontloaded fiscal adjustment would lower interest rates, ease pressures on the currency, and reduce the risk associated with an excessive reliance on external financing, a set of economic, social, and political constraints justifies a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit. In particular, reducing government current spending, which increased so much during the last decade, should boost public investment in infrastructure and reduce taxes on firms and households. Introducing a medium-term fiscal framework would help establish the credibility of the needed fiscal rebalancing. * **The pace of disinflation should remain sensitive to its short-term economic costs.** Bringing inflation to a single digit is essential to strengthen long-term growth and reduce poverty, but the tight monetary policy stance needed to build the central bank's anti-inflation reputation is likely to have short-term output costs. To reduce these costs, the report recommends modifying the central bank's charter, narrowing its mandate to price stability, and excluding the possibility of financing the fiscal deficit. * **Rebuilding the foundations of growth will require ambitious supply side reforms.** This includes improving the quality of infrastructure, removing remaining trade barriers, reformulating the regulations for utilities, enhancing market efficiency and competition in key private sector industries (including energy), and making further progress in the government's ambitious anti-corruption plan. Advancing in all these areas will require time, persistence, and political skills. But completing the transition that began at the end of 2015 holds promise for a new economic landscape in Argentina, one that can generate significant improvements in the living standards of its population.

This arcane subject has now emerged as a new lightning rod in the debate on fairness in international taxation. As citizens demand that corporations pay their fair share of taxes and some governments struggle to raise enough revenues for basic services, tax treaties present difficult issues. These treaties'there are now over 3,000'are generally designed to avoid taxing the same profit twice by determining, for example, when and how a treaty country can or cannot tax foreign-owned companies. Developing countries have used them with the intention of boosting economic development. The evidence for that is weak, but certainly treaties can provide important benefits, such as exchange-of-information provisions and mechanisms for resolving disputes between taxpayers and tax administrations. The problem is that tax treaties'and the international system of taxation more generally'are highly complex and have unleashed unforeseen forces. Multinational companies, with much at stake, can use treaties to route income through third countries to exploit favorable tax treaties. Tax authorities, particularly in developing countries, are finding it hard to counter such 'treaty shopping.'\u009d What became clear at this discussion on October 9'the latest in a series hosted jointly by the IMF and World Bank'was that certain aspects of tax treaties are particularly damaging to developing countries. Addressing those aspects will be key to shoring up domestic revenues in the developing world. Here are three insights from the expert roster of panelists, including keynote speaker Stephen Shay, Senior Lecturer at Harvard Law School, and current treaty negotiators from the Ukraine, Colombia, and the United States. **Tax treaties are like a bathtub; a single leaky one is a drain on a country's revenues** Professor Shay has gone to bat on both sides of the tax treaty divide. He has negotiated on behalf of the U.S. government, trying to prevent double taxation of U.S. companies' income and protecting the country's tax base, and he has helped private corporations navigate the world of tax treaties to minimize their tax payments. He advised countries to be systematic about their approach to tax treaties. Developing economies should be skeptical as to whether benefits of a bilateral income tax treaty program outweigh costs, and any one treaty should be considered 'a potential treaty with the world'\u009d: if a country has 10 treaties, he said, investors will take advantage of the 'worst' one. That is, the treaty that allows for the most tax avoidance and establishes tax-treaty linkages to jurisdictions with very low or even zero corporate income tax rates. Such strategies help reduce effective corporate tax rates of multinational groups. Countries can protect themselves from this behavior by thinking about whether a tax treaty makes economic sense and how it will fit within a government's overall tax and fiscal policy framework. As a best practice, they should develop their own model treaty before entering into negotiations, so they have a clear idea of what they will accept. Most importantly, key benefits of a treaty can be accomplished by relying on other instruments or using a 'light treaty approach'\u009d: signing agreements limited to (i) information exchange; (ii) a commitment to transfer pricing principles; and (iii) a mutual agreement procedure to resolve tax disputes. **Sometimes it's a country's finance ministry versus its diplomatic corps, not country versus multinationals** This insight falls into the category of 'politics always matters, dummy,'\u009d but was, nonetheless, somewhat surprising. A number of panelists, including Professor Shay, described the pressures treaty negotiators face from the diplomatic corps in their country. 'No state department likes to see any treaty terminated,'\u009d Shay said. One negotiator from Eastern Europe said her country has even set a target'100 treaties'and it is hard to persuade leaders to look at the quality of what they're negotiating, not the number. This presupposes that treaties are an unfettered benefit to the countries agreeing to them'but often this is not the case. **Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater ** One simple tool for keeping tax resources within a country's borders are 'withholding'\u009d obligations. In a situation where a firm is operating in another country, that 'host'\u009d country'say, for instance, the country with the customers, as opposed to the one with the headquarters'withholds a certain portion of income before it is transferred back to the 'resident'\u009d headquarters country. Withholding instruments can generate revenue or be a simple safeguard against profit shifting. But they may impose negative effects on the investment climate, as we learned from Natalia Aristizabal, who has negotiated treaties for Colombia. She described a situation in which a combination of the taxing rights Colombia and a high withholding tax in Peru leads to Colombian companies not being willing to provide services in Peru which otherwise would be profitable and promote trade and economic development. **What can be done?** We know that governments that raise less than 15 percent of their gross domestic product in tax revenues have trouble funding basic services; undue loss of tax income is a critical development problem. Professor Shay proposed three options for countries with damaging treaty regimes: (1) renegotiate those treaties; (2) terminate them in accordance with their terms; or (3) if constitutionally possible, and as a last resort, override offending provisions with domestic legislation. But however countries approach the reform of their treaties, he recommends that they start with the worst treaty first. The good news is that the potential downside of treaties is now receiving much more attention. This month, countries have the option of signing a OECD- constructed, multilateral legal instrument designed to allow for the large- scale amendment of existing treaties. This is no simple matter, however, as each country will retain its own treaty priorities. The advice heard at the IMF-World Bank event will continue to apply. Stay tuned!

This 'debt bias'\u009d is now widely recognized as a real risk to economic stability. A [new IMF study argues that it needs to feature more prominently on tax reform agendas; it also sets out options for how to do that. **Debt bias: Why we should (still) worry** The IMF's recent [_Fiscal Monitor_ shows that global debt levels have risen to a record 225 percent of world GDP. And high corporate debt poses significant economic stability risks'especially in the financial sector: no one needs any reminder of the enormous damage from distress and failure of large financial institutions. Since the global financial crisis, many governments have strengthened policies to mitigate excessive corporate borrowing, notably by tightening regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. That's good. But most tax systems continue to do exactly the opposite: they allow interest to be deductible, but not the costs of equity finance, and so encourage corporations to finance themselves through debt rather than equity. Chart 1 clearly shows that this tax discrimination in favor of debt is still widespread. [ In advanced economies, the tax bias has increased debt ratios in nonfinancial corporations by, on average, 7 percent of total assets (about 15 percent of GDP). Our [new results find that, despite their special status, financial institutions show a very similar response. Debt bias thus amplifies financial and macroeconomic stability risks'and the effect is too big to keep ignoring. **What can be done? ** There are two broad ways to mitigate debt bias: limit the tax deductibility of interest, or provide a deduction for equity costs. There is now plenty of experience with both. **_Limiting interest deductions_** Some 60 countries have some form of limitation on interest deductibility. The details of the rules on these limitations vary greatly'and those details matter. * 39 countries apply the limitations only to 'related-party'\u009d debt (between affiliates within a multinational group). New analysis reported in our paper finds that (as one might expect) these rules have no discernable impact on firms' borrowing from unrelated parties'which is what gives rise to stability concerns. * 21 countries have rules applicable to _all _debt, related party or not. On average, these rules do reduce the external debt-to-asset ratio by around 5 percentage points'a significant effect. Limitations on interest deductibility thus can work, but only if they cover all forms of debt. **_Allowing a deduction for equity_** Several countries'Belgium, Cyprus, Italy, and Turkey'have introduced an allowance for corporate equity (ACE). This retains the deduction for interest but adds a similar deduction for the normal return on equity. Economists tend to like the ACE: it neutralizes debt bias and also eliminates tax distortions to investment. And the allowance continues to win over policymakers: Switzerland will soon introduce it, the Danish government has recently proposed its adoption, and the European Commission included it in its [recent proposal for a common corporate tax base in the European Union. And the ACE works. Chart 2 reports new evidence on the effect of the Belgian allowance on corporate debt ratios in nonfinancial firms (left) and banks (right), relative to a synthetic control group of companies in other countries. The impact is significant and large: the debt ratio in Belgium is almost 20 percentage points lower than in the control group for nonfinancial firms and almost 14 percentage points lower than in the control group for banks. [ The main hesitation about the ACE is the potential revenue loss. We find that if the allowance were given to all equity, corporate income tax revenue would fall by 5-12 percent (Chart 3, left panel). But governments can reduce the revenue cost while preserving the efficiency gains from the ACE by giving it only in respect to equity added after some base year'as is done in Italy and Switzerland and has been proposed in Denmark and by the European Commission. This reduces the first-year revenue cost to about 1 percent of corporate income tax revenue (Chart 3, right panel). In the financial sector, moreover, the allowance might be granted only for equity above what is already required due to minimum regulatory capital requirements, which would further reduce the fiscal costs. [ **No better moment** Since the global crisis, debt bias has become much more widely recognized as a real macroeconomic concern. Governments have taken some steps to fix the distortions it creates. But the issue has not gone away, and in the financial sector, tax policies (which encourage debt finance) and regulatory policies (which do the opposite) continue to be fundamentally misaligned. In our view, debt bias needs to figure more prominently in countries' corporate tax reform agendas. The approaches discussed here have proven effective, and they can be tailored to countries' circumstances. The revenue impact is currently muted by low interest rates. There will be no better moment than now to address the 'Great Distortion'\u009d once and for all.

Economists track the relationship between jobs and growth using [Okun's Law, which says that higher growth leads to lower unemployment. New [research from the IMF looks at Okun's Law and asks, based on the evidence, will growth create jobs? The findings show a striking variation across countries in how employment responds to GDP growth over the course of a year. In some countries, when growth picks up, employment goes up and unemployment falls; in other countries the response is quite muted. A pick-up in growth'through a stimulus to the demand side of the economy, for instance increased government spending on infrastructure'will result in more jobs. **Some countries generate more jobs from growth than others** [ The extent of job creation in the short run varies across countries. This chart shows how much employment increases when growth picks for the Group of Twenty advanced and emerging economies, which together account for the lion's share of global GDP and employment. While Okun's Law holds overall for the United States, the relationship between unemployment and growth since 2011 did deviate from the historical pattern because the depth and duration of the great recession'the period following the global crisis in 2008'led to so many more people losing their jobs. In South Africa, Australia, and Canada, a 1 percent increase in GDP is matched by an increase in employment of 0.6 percent or higher. In contrast, there is virtually no response of employment to growth in China, Indonesia, and Turkey. The extent to which changes in growth account for changes in unemployment and employment also varies across countries. GDP growth accounts for over 70 percent of the variation in employment in Canada and the United States, about 40 percent in Russia, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and very little in many other countries. For the majority of countries around the world, taking account of growth is an important part of understanding short-run changes in unemployment. For other countries, there are several possible explanations for the weakness of the jobs-growth link. In some cases, reported unemployment rates may not fully reflect the true unemployment rate. Some countries are going through rapid structural change and unemployment may be driven by this longer-run trend rather than short-run fluctuations. **You can't have one without the other** This then begs the questions: Where will growth come from? Global growth has been too low, for too long, and for too few. The answer is found on both the demand and supply side of the economy. For example, if companies do not see their sales improving, they will not increase their capacity to produce more, so it is essential to ensure that the demand is there to sustain supply. But without supply measures, gains in output based solely on a stimulus to demand will prove temporary. The range of supply measures varies, from removing bottlenecks in the power sector to reforms in labor and product markets. In many countries, there is a strong case to increase spending on public infrastructure, which would provide a much-needed boost to demand in the short term and would also help supply. All this means countries need to use all policies'monetary, fiscal, and structural'to maximize growth _within_ countries and amplify the impact though coordination _across_ countries. This 'three-pronged'\u009d approach would free up more policy space'[more room to act_'_than is commonly assumed.

Just like the region's population, the number of migrants doubled since 1990 to reach about 20 million in 2013. In the coming decades, migration will expand given the demographic boom in the working-age population'the group that typically feeds migration. We studied these trends in a recent [paper because both receiving and sending countries need the right policies so all can benefit. **People on the go** Two trends dominate the evolution of sub-Saharan migration. The number of refugees'people fleeing due to war or persecution'has decreased considerably since 1990, both within and outside the region. In 1990 about half of total migrants were refugees, and this share has declined to only about 10 percent by 2013. At the same time, the share of migrants that move outside the region for economic reasons has increased steadily, growing sixfold between 1990 and 2013'from about 1 million to 6 million. In comparison, economic migrants within the region increased threefold'from 4 million to 12 million (Chart 1). [ Migration within Africa is predominantly driven by geographic proximity, income differences, wars in the home country, and relative political stability in the host country, along with cultural links and environmental factors such as droughts or floods. Cote d'Ivoire and South Africa are among the biggest recipients of migrants from the region.

Headline inflation averaged 1.9 percent, 1994'2015, and long-term inflation expectations have been very well anchored to the 2 percent target (Chart 1). [ The current economic environment, however, poses unusual challenges to monetary policy in many countries: low and sub-zero interest rates; significant economic slack; and the risk that inflation might get stuck below target. In the event of further headwinds, the [Bank of Canada has indicated that it might use unconventional tools, such as ad hoc forward guidance on the policy interest rate, quantitative easing, funding for credit, and negative interest rates. But using such tools are not without disadvantages. In our recent [paper, we consider instead modifications to the existing framework that would increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, we make a case for the Bank of Canada to use conventional forward guidance before employing unconventional tools to achieve its policy goals. **Conventional forward guidance** Systematic transparency about policy intentions makes monetary policy more effective. We recommend that the Bank of Canada'like most central banks that rank above it on the [Dincer- Eichengreen transparency index (Chart 2)'publish the path of the short-term interest rate from the forecast used at its policy meetings (of which there are 8 per year). That is, the Bank should, as a matter of routine, provide conventional forward guidance as to the future path of the rate, with the usual caveats, of course, including that such guidance is not a commitment and is conditional on the Bank's latest forecast. It is important to emphasize that conditions change in ways that forecasts do not foresee, and policymakers must therefore adjust the future interest rate path so as to guide inflation back to the target within a reasonable time horizon. Publication of a confidence band for the interest rate path, and alternative scenarios to the baseline forecast, help to clarify the conditionality. [ Conventional forward guidance, however, should not be confused with ad hoc forward guidance, an unconventional tool that has been used to stimulate the economy and spur a robust recovery. Such guidance was practiced by the Bank of Canada in 2009, and more extensively by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The conditional commitment to a very low rate had some success in reducing longer-term interest rates, but it has also created communications problems especially with respect to the duration of the commitment and to what would happen next (see, for example, in the [United States). Conventional forward guidance would help strengthen the inflation-targeting framework. Two points to stress here. **First**, the current setting of the money market overnight interest rate'the Bank's main policy instrument'in and of itself has a negligible direct effect on the macro economy. The effectiveness of any policy rate actions depends on their influence over expected future short-term rates, and hence on the medium- and longer-term interest rates at which households and firms invest and borrow. Policymakers must therefore have a view on the whole medium-term path of the policy rate when making decisions. **Second**, even given all the objective factors forecasters consider important, the future policy rate path that will return inflation to the target is not unique. The one chosen for the forecast reflects policymakers' preferences about the short-run output and inflation trade-off. Only the central bank can know which path it has in mind in managing this trade-off. In the absence of direct guidance, markets have to guess at their intentions. Through its impact on expectations, conventional forward guidance would help to make the monetary policy instrument more effective. By publishing the forecast interest rate path, the central bank reveals how it plans to navigate the short-run trade-off between output and inflation. If the path is considered credible to market participants, the term structure of interest rates and the exchange rate will move in support of the objectives of policy. **More than just an academic debate ** Some might see this issue as merely an academic debate but it has real consequences. It can strengthen the policymakers' toolkit to address Canada's current economic challenges. Under conventional forward guidance, an aggressive strategy to deal with the current slack and improve the economy's resilience would be made possible. For example, further negative shocks when the policy interest rate is near zero could push the economy closer towards a low inflation trap, from which escape can be very difficult. In this context, a strategy where there is an explicit forecast for the policy rate to stay low for longer, and inflation temporarily overshoots the target, would help to raise inflation expectations, lower real interest rates, depreciate the exchange rate, and stimulate the economy, as laid out in our [paper. As economic growth improves, the desired interest rate would increase and the economy can safely exit from ultra-low interest rates. Conventional forward guidance allows the central bank to give a credible public account of the strategy to achieve its objectives and reinforce confidence in the 2 percent inflation target. In light of Canada's economic challenges, its current policy for fiscal stimulus is fully justified, especially in view of the low government debt-to- GDP ratio and the exceptionally low cost of long-term government borrowing. Making monetary policy instruments more effective would compliment these fiscal efforts to boost growth, strengthening Canada's resilience and ability to handle unexpected shocks.

For one thing, shale oil production has permanently added to supply at lower prices. For another, demand will be curtailed by slower growth in emerging markets and global efforts to cut down on carbon emissions. It all adds up to a 'new normal'\u009d for oil. **The 'new'\u009d oil supply** Shale has been a game changer**.** Unexpectedly strong shale-oil production of 5 million barrels per day contributed to the global supply glut. That, along with the surprising decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to keep production unchanged, contributed to the oil price collapse that started in June 2014. Although the price collapse led to a massive cut in oil [investment, production was slow to respond, keeping supply in excess. What's more, the resilience of shale production to lower prices again surprised market participants, leading to even lower prices in 2015. Shale drillers significantly cut costs by improving efficiency, allowing major players to avoid bankruptcy. While reduced investment is expected to result in lower production by non-OPEC countries in 2016, production still exceeds consumption. Many experts expect oil markets to balance in 2017, albeit with high level of inventory (Chart 1). That said, there is uncertainty regarding supply, especially regarding the cost associated with extraction as well as production from so-called shale \"fracklog\"'drilled but uncompleted wells. The latter can add to production flows in a matter of weeks and hence considerably change the dynamics of production compared to conventional oil'that features long lead times between investment and production. [ Against that backdrop, OPEC countries and Russia have been increasing output, and Iran's return to markets has added even more supply. (While OPEC members have recently agreed to cut production, that agreement is yet to be finalized.) There are other factors at play. Recent data suggest that shale- oil production may be once again more resilient than expected. And the anticipation of an OPEC production cut in cooperation with other exporters has boosted prices to the level that will further stimulate output by many shale producers. **The 'new'\u009d oil demand** Falling prices spurred oil-demand growth, which rose to a record high of about 1.8 million barrels per day in 2015. That's expected to slow to the trend level of 1.2 million barrels per day in 2016 and 2017. Using basic estimates for demand elasticity with respect to price suggests the 'price effect'\u009d accounts for a 0.8 million-barrel per day increase in demand. A sizable share of oil demand growth is attributable to the price drop rather than income gains. With limited scope for further declines in prices in dollar terms, increases in oil demand will depend largely on [prospects for global economic growth. The outlook for demand growth isn't encouraging. In the past couple of years, oil demand has been driven by China and other emerging-market and developing countries. While China accounts for just 15 percent of world oil consumption, its contribution to oil demand growth is significant (Chart 2) because its economy is growing much faster than those of advanced nations (the same is true of some other developing nations). Further slowdowns in emerging and advanced economies can change the demand picture significantly. Structural shifts in emerging economies, especially China's effort to shift from an investment and export led growth model to a domestic demand led growth model, can also potentially have major implications. [ Over the medium to long run, the transition away from oil and other fossil fuels further clouds the outlook for oil demand albeit [lower prices may delay the transition. Energy policies will have to be altered significantly to meet the goals set at the December 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), and a significant portion of oil reserves will have to remain [under the ground and unburned. Lack of clarity about the specific actions needed to achieve those goals only adds to uncertainty about the oil-demand outlook. [ Granted, futures markets point to slight gains in oil prices. But a glance at shifts in futures-price curves in the past few months suggests that the prospects for higher prices have been worsening (see Chart 3). That shouldn't come as a surprise. Downward revisions to global growth forecasts, especially for emerging markets, offset supporting factors, such as the growth in oil demand buoyed by [lower prices in the past year. Turmoil in financial markets, plus a strong dollar, has put downward pressure on oil prices. These trends, along with the [secular drop in petroleum consumption in advanced economies and the growth of shale, all point to a 'lower for longer'\u009d scenario for oil prices.

A new [IMF study shows that, over the longer term, both high- and low-skilled workers who migrate bring benefits to their new home countries by increasing income per person and living standards. High-skilled migrants bring diverse talent and expertise, while low-skilled migrants fill essential occupations for which natives are in short supply and allow natives to be employed at higher-skilled jobs. Moreover, the gains are broadly shared by the population. It may therefore be well-worth shouldering the short-term costs to help integrate these new workers. **Migration is nothing new** Rhetoric surrounding migration has turned more negative in recent years. Yet, migration is not a new phenomenon. While the recent refugee surge has made it a hot-button issue, advanced economies already have a large and growing population of migrants (Chart 1). They constitute 15 to 20 percent of the working-age population in many advanced economies, and around 30 percent in some Anglo-Saxon countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Between 1990 and 2015, immigrants accounted for half of the growth in working age population of advanced economies. They are essential to ensure the future workforce in most advanced economies, where the working-age population would shrink over the next decade without further immigration. [ While the stock of low-skilled migrants has been the largest (and broadly constant in percent of adult population over time), the share of high-skilled has been on the rise. Anglo-Saxon countries tend to have a higher proportion of high-skilled migrants than continental European and Nordic countries. As migrants on average tend to be younger than their adopted country's native- born population, they help increase the share of working age population. This is the best known channel through which migration increases income per person. But as this new study shows, it is by far not the most important one. **Migration can be a boon** The study found that the most important channel through which the arrival of migrant workers affects income per person is by increasing labor productivity (Chart 2). * _**Migrants increase GDP per person and productivity: **_** **A 1 percentage point increase in the share of migrants in the adult population increases GDP per person in advanced economies by up to 2 percent in the longer term. This increase comes primarily from an increase in labor productivity, instead of an increase in the workforce-to-population ratio. * **_Both high- and low-skilled migrants improve productivity_:** The gains migrants bring are not exclusive to high-skilled workers with specific knowledge and diverse skills. Low-skilled migrants also have a significant impact on overall productivity by complementing the existing skill set of the population: a) Low-skilled migrants **fill essential occupations** for which the native- born population is in short supply, contributing to a more efficient functioning of the economy; b) When low-skilled migrants take up more manual routine tasks, t**he native- born population tend to move to more complex occupations** that require language and communication skills in which they have a comparative advantage; and c) In what is a key example of complementarity, low-skilled migrants provide housekeeping and childcare services (the 'nanny effect'\u009d) and thus allow native-born women to return to work, or work longer hours. Indeed, **wherever more low-skilled migrants are present, more high-skilled females participate in the labor force**. * **_Prosperity is broadly shared_:** An increase in the migrant share benefits the average income per person of both the bottom 90 percent and the top 10 percent of earners, even though high-skilled migration benefits more the average income of top earners. In addition, the presence of migrants does not seem to increase inequality within the bottom 90 percent of earners. [ **There is more work to do** Immigration can bring substantial benefits to advanced economies, in terms of higher per capita GDP and standards of living. These gains are broadly shared by the population. But the key to reaping these benefits is to address the challenges posed by migration in the short term and, in particular, to ensure migrants are integrated into the labor market. The policies to accomplish this include: language training, job search support, better recognition of the education and work experience of migrants, and lower barriers to entrepreneurship. While integrating migrants can add to fiscal cost pressures in the short run, these policies allow migrants to obtain and keep a job at a relevant skill level, and increasingly contribute to the fiscal accounts. At the same time, native workers, too, require some help to adjust, including by upgrading their skills. Policymakers also need to avoid possible overburdening of public services such as health care and education to contain possible buildup of social tensions.

He saw debt and deflation as the big, bad actors. Now, their close relatives'too high debt and too low inflation'are still in play, at least for advanced economies. ## Related Links * [Read the report * [Fiscal issues at the IMF Until now, however, a full picture of global debt was missing. The October 2016 _[Fiscal Monitor_ has, for the first time, put a number on the size of debt covering virtually the whole world. And the picture is not pretty. Global debt is at record highs, amounting to $152 trillion or 225 percent of global GDP (Chart 1). Close to $100 trillion or about two thirds are liabilities of nonfinancial firms and households'private debt. The remainder is public debt. [ As Fisher warned, such high debt levels represent a major headwind against the global economic recovery, which exacerbates the risk of falling into a debt- deflation spiral. But debt levels are not the same everywhere. Nor are the risks. Trends have been very diverse: * First, deleveraging among advanced economies has been uneven and private debt ratios have continued rising in most countries within this group (Chart 2, blue bar). At the same time, public debt has increased, partly due to the migration of the bad debts of the private sector on to the public sector balance sheet. * Second, low interest rates have led to a surge in the nonfinancial corporate debt of a few systemically important emerging market economies, notably China (Chart 2, red bar). Since the rapid deterioration of government balance sheets in many advanced economies was also preceded by a similar boom, the more recent debt expansion in emerging market economies raises questions about the underlying health of the fiscal positions. * Third, private and public debt have gone up in low-income countries thanks to more depth'in terms of size and liquidity'in their financial markets, and improved market access, but debt ratios remain generally low in these countries. Advances in microfinance lending and mobile banking have also contributed to financial inclusion. Provided debts remain sustainable, financial development is a good thing and should be seen as part of inclusive growth. [ **A sober intermission ** The concern with excessive private debt goes beyond the risk that it may mutate into public debt. Excessive private debt is associated with financial crises. Moreover, financial recessions are longer and deeper than normal recessions. They entail larger output losses and cause more people to lose their jobs. All of which ultimately links back to public debt and deficits. Weak fiscal positions make financial recessions even worse (Chart 3). That is particularly true for emerging market economies where public spending is often slashed in times of crisis. This pattern illustrates how excessively easy fiscal policy in good times often forces spending cuts in bad times, which are especially costly during a financial crisis. But, even in the absence of a crisis, high private debt may hamper growth, as highly indebted borrowers eventually slash their consumption and investment sharply. [ The lack of progress in deleveraging among advanced economies'where private debt levels are the highest'can be traced back mainly to the low nominal growth environment. Comparing the United States and the euro area is very instructive as the former reduced private debt much more than the euro area in the aftermath of the crisis but it enjoyed higher growth rates as well (Chart 4). [ Given the risks and associated uncertainties, should debt be avoided altogether? Debt is fundamental for entrepreneurship and innovation, and thereby, for growth. It is _excessive_ private debt that countries should avoid. Therefore, regulatory and supervisory policies should ensure the monitoring and sustainability of private debt. [Tax policy can also help curb excessive leverage by gradually phasing out tax distortions favoring debt over equity in corporations, financial and non-financial. **New actors in a brand new play** In the meantime, growth-friendly fiscal policies can help facilitate the adjustment in those countries mired in excessive private debt. The solution will depend, of course, on country circumstances and available fiscal resources that may have been created by saving and reducing public debt in good times. Generally, in countries where the financial system is under severe stress, resolving the underlying problem early on is critical. Well-designed and targeted action, in the form of government-sponsored programs to reduce private debt (such as subsidies for creditors to lengthen maturities or guarantees) and measures to accelerate the cleanup of balance sheets (for example though asset management companies), can be highly effective. The design of these measures is critical for minimizing their cost and mitigating moral hazard. In particular, they should be targeted to specific sectors or individuals, subjected to conditionality, and involve burden sharing with borrowers. Strong insolvency and bankruptcy procedures should also accompany them. Ultimately, however, fiscal policy cannot do it alone: it has to be supported by complementary policies, including monetary and structural policies, implemented within consistent and credible policy frameworks to achieve the desired goal. As for the play currently on stage, now is the time to get rid of the big bad actors and move on to a brand new and exciting play about a coming acceleration in nominal growth.

Global growth remains weak, even though it shows no noticeable deceleration over the last quarter. The new [_World Economic Outlook_ sees a slowdown for the group of advanced economies in 2016 and an offsetting pickup for emerging and developing economies. Taken as a whole, the world economy has moved sideways. Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself'through the negative economic and political forces it is unleashing. We project global output growth at 3.1 percent in 2016 and 3.4 percent in 2017'the same as in early July, shortly after the United Kingdom's 'Brexit'\u009d vote to leave the European Union. Within this broad outlook, however, we have slightly marked down 2016 growth prospects for advanced economies while marking up those in the rest of the world. Prospects for 2017 are unchanged for both country groupings. Over the medium term, while we expect that advanced economies will continue along a disappointingly low growth path, emerging market and developing economies should accelerate as most of the large countries with currently shrinking economies stabilize and return to their longer-term growth paths. Even this more granular view conceals important differences within country groups. U.S. growth has disappointed in 2016, but is partially offset by smaller upside surprises in Europe and Japan. Outside of the advanced economies, emerging Asia has done better, whereas sub-Saharan Africa as a whole has been dragged down by its big commodity exporters despite a number of smaller countries benefiting from lower commodity prices. **Why not be satisfied with recent growth rates?** Other things being unchanged, the trend shift in global output away from mature and relatively slow-growing economies, toward emerging and developing economies, should raise global growth over time. But this has not happened. Compared to the 1998'2007 averages, long-term potential growth is now projected to be lower in all regions, and current growth rates are lower still in much of the world, notably in emerging market and developing economies. Admittedly, some of this long-term growth decline reflects demographic trends as well as developments during the earlier period that could not be sustained: the initial burst in productivity due to the information and communications technology revolution, China's growth surge, and a global financial up-cycle that culminated in a severe worldwide crisis. Yet negative output gaps remain widespread, and the crisis has left a cocktail of interacting legacies'high debt overhangs, non-performing loans on banks' books, deflationary pressures, low investment, and eroded human capital'that continue to depress potential output levels. Because investors and consumers become more cautious when they fear income growth may lag for longer, realized growth can fall as well. These self-fulfilling mechanisms could be reversed were global demand higher. But the policy response so far has been unbalanced in relying excessively on central banks. Markets fear that policy has no room to counter the next big negative economic shock. Then there is the gathering political fallout from persistently low growth. The slow and incomplete recovery from crisis has been especially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners, leaving little room for those with lower incomes to advance. The result in some richer countries has been a political movement that blames globalization for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations. Brexit is only one example of this tendency. In short, growth has been too low for too long, and in many countries its benefits have reached too few'with political repercussions that are likely to depress global growth further. These concerns highlight the risks to our projections, which remain tilted to the downside. The presumed recovery in 2017 and beyond, could be derailed by several, possibly interacting developments: a bumpy transition in China, a sharp further fall in commodity prices, a tightening in global financial conditions, or a sharp hike in trade barriers. Geopolitical tensions could flare up, adding to the humanitarian crises already afoot in the Middle East and Africa and further complicating the policymaking environment. **Comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated** An upside outcome would be the adoption by many countries of comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated policies that exploit synergies across instruments, time, and countries to boost growth and make it more inclusive. This strategy was explained in a [Staff Discussion Note that we issued last week. Comprehensive policies are three-pronged: they deploy structural and fiscal policy in support of monetary policy, while monetary policy, in turn, maximizes the expansionary effects of structural reforms and active fiscal policy. Consistent and well-communicated policies harness the power of stabilizing expectations. Coordination among countries'as with the 2014 Brisbane Action Plan on structural measures'confers beneficial spillovers, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts. If widely adopted, this general approach, based on the three policy prongs the IMF has been recommending, can raise growth now. It could also defend against a negative global shock, limiting the resulting damage to fiscal positions, if carried out on a larger scale. Among structural policies, a renewed commitment to lowering trade barriers is especially important, in contrast to current trends. At the same time, governments must recognize the need to develop labor-market resilience, to lower barriers to entry in product and service markets, and to ease adjustment for those most vulnerable to the dislocations from technology, trade, and structural reforms. Here too, policymakers can send the clearest message and have the biggest effect through coordinated action.

And then, lack of cooperation leads to crisis; crisis belatedly forces cooperation; but that cooperation must begin with picking up the pieces. We saw this during the Great Depression when the international community was unable to find common ground and cooperate on monetary, exchange rate, and trade policies. Then in the wake of the Second World War, perhaps the single greatest cataclysm in history, the painful lessons of that failure gave birth to the economic and political cooperation we have known all our lives. Now, as the forces of economic and political fragmentation rise again, are we fated to repeat the mistakes of our history? **For two generations, countries supported a global order based on institutional arrangements aimed at protecting economic stability and safeguarding security**. That order, although imperfect, commanded broad support by permitting meaningful and constructive international cooperation while sufficiently preserving national prerogatives and sovereignty to receive broad and continued support. Through long periods of prosperity punctuated by recession, and throughout the Cold War and its aftermath, that order produced decades of economic progress and stability, and unprecedented increases in living standards lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and created a global middle class. **Growing discontent** **Today, however, we are witnessing rising challenges to the global order, including an erosion of popular support, and a deepening atmosphere of uncertainty**. We will seek to enhance the dialogue on cooperation in an October 7 [seminar held during the IMF [Annual Meetings in Washington. Ian also has written a [background paper on the topic. On the economic front, there is growing discontent in advanced economies stemming from the damage of the global financial crisis, slowing income growth, technologies that make many jobs obsolete, and the individual and community displacement that comes from global interconnectedness. The downsides of modern capitalism have now appeared in sharp relief. Stagnant middle class wage and job growth and rising inequality are fraying the social contract. **Opportunistic political leaders are successfully playing on fear of fast-moving change that seems beyond the control of ordinary citizens'and even their elected representatives**. In the United States, economic progress by minorities and women, celebrated by many, has provoked a backlash from those who feel they are falling behind. Some emerging market economies are struggling to cope with the yawning gap between the rising expectations of the new middle class and the ability of governments to deliver amid slowing global and domestic growth. But the challenges extend beyond economics. Indeed, economics, politics and security are becoming inextricably intertwined in our world. **Most importantly, the global political landscape is changing**. For almost a decade, the United States and Europe have concentrated political energy on recovery from the global financial crisis, and that focus has sapped the will to engage proactively with the wider world. At the same time, China's rapid growth and active involvements in Asia and Africa are tilting the global balances of economic and political power. Despite some slowdown, China still accounts for 37 percent of all global growth. The emerging market countries are rightfully demanding a greater say in international fora and institutions. **Geopolitical forces ** Meanwhile, the emergence of non-state actors imposes new threats and costs that make cooperation more complicated. Wars in the Middle East have bred failed states, the rise of ISIS, and a flood of refugees that burdens the region and Europe. Terrorism and cyber threats are now worrisome facts of life for all countries. These issues can be dealt with only through international cooperation. In the geopolitical realm, there are **other important factors that complicate cooperation**. While not a new phenomenon, there is strong resentment of United States tactics, including its frequent use of sanctions (which is viewed as a 'weaponization of finance'\u009d), attacks from unmanned drones within the borders of other countries, and surveillance on foreign leaders. European leaders face a formidable set of internal problems'including managing the refugee crisis, negotiating Brexit, controlling terrorism, and placating populations weary of reform and change. Finally, the emerging powers'Brazil, India, China, Russia, and South Africa'and others aspire to more influence in their regions and in the world, along with power and influence in global institutions commensurate with their growing international importance and interests. Unconvinced that advanced countries will cede this ground, even over time, they have proposed and funded alternative approaches, either through the creation of institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the emerging market economies New Development Bank, or by stepping up their own national efforts to support development and extend their influence abroad. Yet another dimension adding to complexity comes from **disruptive new technologies**, including advances in information, distributed ledger, and big data technologies, as well as artificial intelligence. These developments hold great promise, but they raise questions about the profitability and sustainability of existing institutions and companies, and may erode the effectiveness of existing legal and regulatory systems. Because these trends **make the future uncertain**, they may also stunt demand by prompting precautionary savings and keeping nervous investors on the sidelines. How to plan for your retirement amid this uncertainty, particularly when interest rates linger near zero? How to invest in Europe's future in a time of 'exit?'\u009d How to invest in a Middle East where states are disintegrating, alliances are shifting, and non-state actors loom? How to prepare for disruptions within individual countries as workers are displaced by machines, or as information technology empowers all kinds of non-state actors to challenge the state's ability to govern effectively. **'What is to be done?'\u009d** **To repeat a question famously posed early in the last century when the global order was being called into question, what is to be done?** The irony of the present predicament is'as we said at the start'that there is more to be achieved by interconnectedness and cooperation than ever. If the advanced economies face a tougher challenge as they mature and productivity growth slows, they can hardly afford to throw away the gains from trade. The emerging market world will continue to depend on the trade, capital and technology that are part and parcel of interconnectedness if it is to sustain and eventually accelerate high growth rates and achieve a convergence of living standards. **It is essential to protect the gains from globalization, by banding together to revitalize growth**. The Group of Twenty advanced and emerging market economies continues to play an essential role in this process, and its member countries need to implement and accelerate the group's growth initiative from this year's Hangzhou summit, making use of all policy levers'monetary, fiscal and structural'to lift the global economy. Recent IMF analysis shows that there remain huge synergies from comprehensive, consistent and cooperative action. By acting together, much more is possible and feasible. **But as we do so, we must make our global and national economies more inclusive to reduce the economic insecurity and rising inequality that has accompanied globalization**. In a capitalist society, most change creates winners and losers. We also recognize that geopolitical 'creative destruction'\u009d is exacerbating the anxiety provoked by economic displacement. So, our efforts to lift growth must be accompanied by **policies that support the poor and those displaced or negatively affected by change**. Our countries must be more open to redistributive policies. That requires a particular focus on providing displaced workers'both in industry and services'with the skills that will enable them to compete in the 21st century economy. Where governments can meet their citizens' expectations for rising living standards and enhanced personal security, populist messages lose their urgency and appeal. Prosperity, in turn, bolsters security and geopolitical cooperation. There is a lot of fanciful talk about building walls these days. In reality, the defensive wall we need is to improve the international community's firewall against future crises. That effort requires better coordination to limit spillovers due to economic vulnerabilities; stronger financial regulations to prevent banking and capital market abuses; and tax cooperation and harmonization to limit the national revenue erosion that results from cross-border profit shifting by corporations. These efforts call for a closer embrace of the multipolarity of our world. We need to protect and, where necessary, reform core multilateral institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and United Nations. Their continuing influence depends on letting governance evolve to reflect changing global power realities. The same approach implies supporting and integrating the new institutions and initiatives promoted by the emerging markets. It also calls for enhancing existing regional financial arrangements, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative, through greater cooperation and coordination. Lastly, the time has come to break down the longstanding divide between economics and security in national and international policymaking. The two are inseparable in a globalized world where territorial disputes and market volatility can reverberate and disrupt without regard to our 20th century constructs. Moreover, only an integrated approach'one that recognizes that security threats have economic repercussions, while economic instability generates security threats'can navigate the hazards of failed states, non- state actors, and regional conflicts to secure a peaceful and stable world. To avoid repeating the mistakes of our history and succumbing to economic and political fragmentation, the time has come for serious dialogue and a renewed spirit of cooperation.

Our [new paper, along with our co-authors, debunks widespread concerns that little can be done by policymakers facing a vicious cycle of (too) low growth, (too) low inflation, near-zero interest rates, and high debt levels. What is the secret? There are three parts to it. None of them is new, but putting them together can add a punch to policy: * First, policies within countries must be **_comprehensive_**'this is not new. For the past two years, the IMF's Managing Director Christine Lagarde has repeatedly championed the simultaneous use of three prongs: monetary; fiscal; and structural policies. * Second, policies within countries must be **_consistent_** over time'this view is also not new, but this paper illustrates its critical importance. * And third, there is a case for internationally **_coordinated _**policies. The IMF has long noted the potential benefits of policy coordination, but the paper illustrates how policies can become much more effective when countries work together toward a common goal. **Policies must be comprehensive** Too often, monetary policy has been the only game in town. Low interest rates since the global financial crisis have not brought growth back to acceptable levels. But monetary policy alone is not enough'fiscal and structural policies need to do much more. For example, targeted public investment can raise domestic demand to close the output gap and, at the same time, raise potential output on a sustainable basis. Structural reforms of product and labor markets would also help unleash countries' economic potential. Financial sector policies that strengthen banks and private balance sheets get credit flowing again, improve the impact and effectiveness of monetary policy, and build resilience of financial systems to shocks. Importantly, these policies complement each other. By acting together, they will have a total effect greater than the sum of benefits from each policy acting alone. For instance, a temporary increase in public investment will have a much greater impact on real and nominal GDP if accompanied by monetary policy accommodation. Structural measures can be more effective with fiscal policy support. **Policies must be consistent** Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies are not likely to succeed if people believe that monetary tightening cannot happen without unsettling markets or that high debt levels will increase risk to intolerable levels. Rather, for accommodative macroeconomic policies to work, policymakers must commit to credible frameworks that adjust policy instruments consistently over time. In the case of monetary policy, a temporary overshooting of the inflation target can help economies escape the deflationary trap much faster if a detailed, transparent, and well-communicated strategy shows the public that the monetary framework can safely allow for such deviations. Similarly, a credible fiscal framework embeds a longer-term vision by indicating how short-term increases or changes in the composition of spending can actually help reduce government debt levels over time, and contain risks associated with public sector balance sheets. **Policies work better when coordinated across borders, especially if a shock strikes again** It would be in each country's interest to coordinate their policies with other countries. By pulling in the same direction at the same time, they can amplify their domestic efforts to lift growth at home and, by implication, around the world. Such coordination between countries would be particularly valuable in the event of another shock like the one in 2008. The benefits of global coordination are indeed recognized in the [2014] G20 Brisbane Action Plan, where major countries committed themselves to stimulate growth at home, using the tools at their disposal and operating within their own political and economic constraints. Does this mean that all these elements have to be deployed at the same time? The answer is no. All countries should follow comprehensive and consistent national policies, even in the absence of international policy coordination. But to get the biggest bang for the buck and credibly escape the next significant negative shock, all three legs must stand together: within countries; over time; and across countries.

But dollarization usually persists many years after the problems that triggered it are alleviated and limits the effect that central banks can have on economic activity and inflation. As a result, many countries have tried to slowly wean their economies off dollar use (see Chart 1). Letting the exchange rate change according to market conditions would help a de-dollarization effort by making it as risky to save as it is to borrow in dollars rather than in the domestic currency. The recent sharp terms-of-trade shock faced by many dollarized emerging markets has added urgency to the issue. The marked decline in export prices has put depreciation pressures on the currencies of commodity producers. Currency depreciation creates winners (such as households with savings in foreign currencies) and losers (such as corporates and households that borrow in foreign currencies because repayments in dollars cost more). As a result, the probability of loan defaults rises as do risks to the financial sector. The question policymakers in highly dollarized economies must confront is whether to allow their exchange rate to adjust fully to the shock of lower commodity prices and expose the financial sector to these negative balance- sheet effects, or to curb exchange-rate flexibility, even if it hinders de- dollarization. In our [study, we look at data for 33 emerging-market economies from 1997 to 2015 and find that greater exchange-rate flexibility reduces incentives to lend in dollars. **Effect of exchange rate flexibility on dollarization** Our research on the effect of exchange rate flexibility on dollarization reveals the following: **First**, the exchange rate had moved more in countries that subsequently experienced a significant reduction in dollar loans (measured as a reduction of loan dollarization of at least 20 percentage points over the sample period, to below 20 percent). **Second**, statistical estimates confirm that more exchange-rate flexibility causes more rapid de-dollarization. These estimates hold even after controlling for the differential in domestic and foreign interest rates, the macroeconomic framework in individual countries (such as whether the country is an inflation targeter), measures of external volatility, the amount of inflation volatility, and other measures of domestic risks. The analysis also suggests that restoring (nearly) full exchange-rate flexibility'and, along with it, the risks of lending and borrowing in foreign currency'would provide incentives to save and borrow in local currency. Our results suggest that policymakers should allow the exchange rate to adjust fully when facing external shocks if they want to reduce dollarization and gain greater control of monetary policy. However, the question remains of how to manage risks from mismatched balance sheets'that is, corporations and households who borrow in dollars but whose income is in the now depreciated local currency. **A look at Peru** Peru'a commodity producer'is a good case study. Following the hyperinflation of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which led to dollarization levels of around 90 percent, Peru embarked upon serious macroeconomic reforms. A new fiscal responsibility law helped keep deficits and debt low, while an inflation- targeting regime, adopted in 2002, bolstered confidence in the local currency. As a result, Peru's inflation rate, averaging 2\u00c2\u00be percent annually since 2002, is among the lowest in Latin America. The economic house was put in order and dollarization receded, but it remained at around 40 percent in 2014. At this level, dollarization still kept the banking system potentially vulnerable to exchange rate movements. Indeed, to support a strategy of limiting financial risks from dollarization, the central bank curbed exchange rate volatility for many years'a decision that could have limited the extent of de-dollarization in the country (see Chart 2). However, recently Peru has put in place macroprudential measures (i.e. measures aimed at overall financial stability rather than the health of individual institutions) to address financial stability risks, while at the same time triggering more rapid de-dollarization. Among the de-dollarization measures, the Peruvian government made it more expensive for banks to lend in foreign currencies'taxing foreign exchange lending, imposing stricter requirements (such as more stringent loan-to-value ratios) on foreign currency loans, and making it less profitable for banks to accept foreign currency deposits by increasing the percentage of those deposits banks must maintain with the central bank (that is higher reserve requirements). Moreover, since 2013, the Peruvian government has set explicit de-dollarization targets and raised the costs of dollar lending in banks that failed to comply with them. These strong incentives for lower lending in U.S. dollar clashed with incentives to keep savings in dollars, as the central bank leaned against fundamental pressures for further currency depreciation. With dollar deposits surpassing dollar loans, the central bank has been offering currency repos (buying dollars with _soles_, Peru's domestic currency, with a promise to reverse the transaction at a set date in the future). This provides banks the _soles_ they need for local currency lending. As a result of these prudential measures, loan dollarization has declined from 40 percent in 2014 to about 29 percent in recent months without a credit crunch, which supported the growth recovery following the 2014 economic slowdown. While continuing to keep one eye on financial stability risks, our research suggests that further exchange-rate flexibility would bring Peru's dollarization further down and help to keep it low, while possibly alleviating the need for accompanying macro-prudential measures to deal with balance-sheet mismatches'a message that also applies to several other emerging market countries. ", "index": 78}, {"pub": "9/20/2016", "title": "No Victory Lap Yet: U.S. Wage Growth Elusive", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=14777", "content": " By [Stephan Danninger The U.S. labor market seems to have finally healed. The unemployment rate has been below 5 percent for some time and job growth is steady. And more Americans are coming back to the labor market'in other words, labor participation is increasing. Yet, despite a bump-up in 2015, wage growth so far this year'compared to the 2000s'is still disappointingly low (see Chart 1). This is worrying because consumer spending, which makes up the majority of U.S. economic output, cannot continue at the current pace unless wages grow. **Still a legacy from the Great Recession** Low wages are a vestige of the crisis. Almost eight years after the height of the crisis, laid-off workers continue to re-enter the labor force, which affects average wage growth. This so-called decomposition effect occurs when new employees are hired for less than the average wage rate. When a worker finds a new job after a long unemployment spell, his or her wages tend to be well below that of peers who remained employed. As a result, these new hires bring down the average hourly wage rate'that is, the rate across all workers. In a [recently published study, I find that this re-entry effect is substantially larger in the post-Great Recession period than before, as returnees to the labor market have to accept large wage cuts. **Low productivity an increasingly important factor** The next question is whether wages among steadily employed workers are growing at a healthy clip. The results are not so surprising: wage growth for a broad segment of workers is also lower than a decade ago. For instance, wages of so-called job stayers'the vast majority of U.S. workers who remain at the same job'have risen 3.5 percent this year, a full percentage point lower than before the Great Recession. Similarly, earnings in the middle of the wage distribution'the 50th percentile'are also seeing less gains than in the past: they have risen by 3.2 this year compared to 4.1 percent during 2000'07. The same is true for workers in services and other sectors. And while it is often said that slow wage growth is due to a rising share of low-paying jobs, the data do not support it: the number of low-wage jobs has grown but not nearly fast enough to make a substantial dent in average wage growth. A likely reason for slow wage growth is declining productivity of workers. The more productive workers are, the more they earn. **Less wage growth from less worker mobility** New research shows that labor mobility'the grease that has oiled the U.S. productivity machinery'has slowed. For more than two decades, workers have transitioned less and less frequently between firms or across sectors. This decline in labor market fluidity, a term publicized by a [2014 study, has weakened a traditional source of wage growth: the climb up the wage ladder by changing jobs. In my study, I show that the decline in job changing was substantial'from 20 percent of job changes per year on average in the early 2000s to 12 percent in the last few years. And the decline was widespread: job move rates fell among young as well as older workers, the skilled and low-skilled, and women and men (see Chart 2). These results hold after accounting for lower job security post-2008 and changes in the age and skill composition of the U.S. labor market. In other words, labor reallocates less than in the past. But are less frequent job changes a bad thing? Maybe, but unlikely. There is little evidence that job searching has become easier and job matching better. Rather, reallocation rates of workers to more productive firms appear to have slowed. Possible reasons are a rise in regulations that have raised the cost of job changing and hiring, technological change that makes skills less transferable, or a rise in social distrust. So, the case of a resounding wage recovery being just around the corner is not a strong one. For this reason, policies that help raise wages by increasing productivity are paramount. In the United States there is a strong policy case for increasing infrastructure investment to help businesses become more productive, but also a need to expand partnerships between industry and higher education institutions, more vocational training, and apprenticeship programs.

Within the region, more than 20 million people are displaced, and a further 10 million are refugees'a scale not seen since the end of World War II. The immense humanitarian costs that these conflicts inflict are difficult to grasp. The economic consequences are also significant. Much of the productive capital in conflict zones has been destroyed, personal wealth and income losses are enormous, and human capital deteriorates with the lack of jobs and education. The Fund, along with the international community, will be called upon to assist in rebuilding the economy once the conflicts end. We have therefore looked more deeply into the economic challenges brought about by these conflicts, as well as into options for policymakers on managing the post- conflict recovery. Let me highlight three key findings that were published in an [IMF staff paper today. **_First, the economic costs of conflicts are massive_.** In addition to tragic loss of life and physical destruction, war and internal strife in countries such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have exacerbated already high levels of poverty, unemployment, and pushed countries further into fragility erasing previous development gains for a whole generation. For example, in Syria school dropout rates reached 52 percent in 2013 and life expectancy fell to 56 years from 76 years before the conflict. Conflicts have also driven up inflation, weakened fiscal and financial positions, caused deep recessions and damaged institutions. For example, after four years of intense fighting, Syria's output is now estimated to be less than half its level in 2010, before the conflict, while inflation surged by almost 300 percentage points in May 2015, the latest available month of data. Yemen lost an estimated 25-35 percent of its GDP in 2015 alone. These are staggering numbers. Conflicts leave deep marks on economies. We estimate that even with a relatively high annual growth rate of 4.5 percent, it would take Syria more than 20 years just to rebound to its 2010 pre-conflict GDP level. [Yet, the impact of conflicts is not confined to national borders. There are also powerful spillovers to neighboring countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Turkey, and beyond (see Chart). To varying degrees, these countries are exposed to the challenges of hosting large numbers of refugees, weaker confidence and security, and declining social cohesion. All this affects the quality of institutions and their ability to undertake much needed economic reforms. **_A second major finding is that appropriate policies can limit the immediate impact of conflicts_.** This means: * _Protecting economic institutions_. Experience has shown that keeping core government institutions functioning in times of conflict'such as fiscal agents and central banks ' is key to maintain life-saving services to people. Such institutions provide wages and salaries, health, and other services. * _Prioritizing spending_. Conflicts are associated with greater fiscal pressures. Spending on security and military increase just as government revenues drop. In such an environment, prioritizing spending is critical to ensure that essential services, including shelter, are maintained to protect the most vulnerable groups. * _Ensuring macroeconomic stability_. Fiscal and external imbalances increase during conflicts, and central banks tend to take on a greater role in financing governments and facilitating economic activity'as happened in Yemen and Libya. The resulting rise in inflation and loss of currency reserves may require the use of nontraditional tools and administrative measures to maintain some degree of macroeconomic control. **_Third, external partners, including the IMF, all have a role to play in helping countries to confront, and eventually overcome, conflict_.** The priority is first and foremost to alleviate human suffering and meet the immediate needs of those affected by conflicts. The IMF has been an important partner in these efforts'for example, by accommodating refugee or security-related outlays in our programs with Iraq, Jordan and Tunisia, as well as through our policy advice and capacity building activities throughout the region. We are also hoping to catalyze additional donor support for countries hosting refugees. At the London Conference for Supporting Syria and the Region in February, donors committed to funding humanitarian and development activities to the tune of $5.9 billion and $5.5 billion for 2016 and 2017'20, respectively. Even if all these pledges were fulfilled, they would not be enough given the magnitude of the crisis. Moreover, any financing should come through grants and concessional loans to reduce the financial burden on recipient countries. Over the longer term, the priority is to provide scaled-up development aid to help rebuild infrastructure and institutions, and, more broadly, strengthen economic and social resilience across the region. Here too, the IMF stands ready to help with a macroeconomic toolkit and experience gained from many years of working in post-conflict zones around the world. The international community has a major responsibility in helping countries in the region overcome this situation. We are ready to do our part.

He replied 'Because it's 2015.'\u009d He was right, of course, and his response demonstrated his government's clear commitment to gender equality. But there is another important reason for promoting greater female participation in the workforce: women in jobs are good for growth. [IMF studies have shown significant macroeconomic gains when women are able to participate more fully in the labor market. Since the global financial crisis, countries around the world have been trying to grow their economies more quickly. Canada is no exception. Low oil prices and weak demand from major trading partners have hampered its exports, and an aging population is shrinking its labor force. The policy prescription is no secret. Canada must improve its labor productivity, which is about 20 percent below the level in the United States, and is growing at less than 1 percent a year. Women are part of the solution. Tapping into Canada's highly educated pool of women would help offset the shrinking labor force, boost growth potential in the medium term, and raise living standards for all Canadians. Moreover, a forthcoming study by the IMF suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in the labor force participation of women with an advanced degree would raise Canada's overall labor productivity growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point a year. So, if the current gap of 7 percentage points between male and female labor force participation were eliminated, the level of real GDP could be about 4\u00c2? percent higher today. To be sure, Canada has already made impressive strides in boosting female labor participation over the past several decades. In 1980, only 60 percent of Canadian women aged 25'54 years old were in the labor market, below the United States and significantly lower than in the Nordic countries, which led the pack. Four decades later, Canada's female labor participation rate is over 80 percent, comparing favorably with most advanced economies'including the United States, where the rate has actually fallen since the mid-1990s to about 74 percent (see Chart 1). Canada's rapid progress in female labor participation was no accident; it reflects deliberate and targeted policy measures. [Two Canadian reform initiatives have been particularly effective in boosting female labor participation. * **Tax reforms**. A federal tax reform in the late 1980s replaced a number of deductions (including on income earned by secondary earners) with tax credits, broadened the tax base, and lowered the marginal tax rate structure. That encouraged more secondary earners (who are usually women'but that is a story for another day!) to participate in the labor force, partly because their tax burden would no longer be tied to the higher marginal tax rate of primary earners. And in the 1990s, the federal government introduced tax cuts and benefits for families with children, further improving work incentives for secondary earners. * **Family-support policies**. Federal and provincial governments launched initiatives to support parenting and early childhood development starting in the late 1990s. They lengthened maternity and parental leaves from a maximum of 37 weeks to 52 weeks in 2001 and established a national system of early learning and child care, supported by increased government spending on early childhood development. These targeted measures worked. Since 1980, Canada's female labor force (aged 25'54 years) has increased by 3.2 million, compared with a 2.1 million increase in its male labor force. Despite these successes, gender gaps still remain in Canada. The participation rate for women was 82 percent in 2015, well below the 92 percent level for men. But the more disappointing fact is that a substantial increase in women with an advanced academic degree has not led to a proportional increase in their participation in the labor force. In 2015, more women received university degrees than men, but their labor participation rate is 7 percentage points lower than men's. Thus, there is still room to tap the underutilized female labor force to anchor strong growth. A good place to start may be by narrowing the remaining policy gaps. While paid maternity and parental leave is the 7th longest in advanced Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies, public spending on early education and care still falls short of that in many advanced economies, and there could be further scope to improve work incentives for secondary earners (see Chart 2). In addition, family support policies should be targeted at enhancing incentives to work. The Canada Child Benefit introduced in the 2016 federal budget is a step in the right direction, by providing benefits to low- and middle-income families (single mothers often fall in the low-income category). But the benefit program'and family support policies more generally'could be better targeted toward increasing childcare subsidies for working parents whose parental leave has expired. To boot, Canada's gender wage gap is well above the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average, and progress in promoting women's representation in senior management has also been slow, with women making up only one in four senior managers. This 'invisible glass ceiling'\u009d could discourage younger generations of women to pursue professional careers. Bold decisions are needed to change corporate cultures and shift social norms'for example, by providing incentives for women's representation on corporate boards or reforming the current parental leave system so that more fathers are willing to take leave. [Prime Minister Trudeau recently tweeted 'poverty is sexist.'\u009d Canada can grow its economy and improve prospects for all Canadian women, especially the poorest, by boosting their participation in the labor force.

Political leaders and pundits sometimes propose import tariffs to offset the supposed price advantages and exert pressure for policy changes abroad. What proponents often fail to realize is that such tariff policies, while certainly hurting their targets, can also be very costly at home. And surprisingly, the self-inflicted harm can be substantial even when trade partners do not retaliate with tariffs of their own. **When the going gets tough** The [World Trade Organization's [Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures allows a country unilaterally to apply a countervailing duty on imports of a good whose production has been subsidized. Other policies that do not clearly fall under the strict WTO definition of a subsidy, including currency undervaluation and accompanying macroeconomic distortions, could also have a net effect of pushing export prices down, leading trade partners to cry foul. Whatever the reason, political discourse perennially focuses on unilateral national action to 'get tough'\u009d with trade partners whose export prices are perceived to be artificially low. Leading examples are the U.S. Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988'which followed a notable period of dollar strength and rising U.S. deficits'and several subsequent initiatives in the U.S. Congress, including a proposal last year to allow industries to press for countervailing duties against alleged currency manipulators. Of course, such pressures [are not limited to the United States; and they are currently taking a toll on global trade, as the forthcoming _World Economic Outlook_ will document. A problem with this approach is that it opens the door to industry lobbying based on criteria likely to be less objective than a measurable financial subsidy. Furthermore, countervailing protection may induce trade partners to impose retaliatory tariffs, possibly setting off mutually destructive trade wars. There is another big drawback of such tariffs: while they may give some relief to industries and workers that directly compete with the affected imports, they will be broadly contractionary, reducing output, investment, and employment in the whole economy. These negative effects follow even if trade partners do not retaliate, although if they did, the outcome would be even worse. This prediction may seem surprising: after all, by shifting demand toward domestically-produced goods and raising the prices of competing imports, wouldn't a tariff both raise output and employment and deliver welcome upward pressure on inflation? That the answer is 'no'\u009d was pointed out more than a half century ago by Robert Mundell, winner of the 1999 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (and, incidentally, a staff member in the IMF's Research Department during the early 1960s). [Mundell perceived the key reason why a tariff could have these negative aggregate effects: by promising to improve the importer country's underlying balance of payments position, it causes the domestic currency to strengthen in the foreign exchange market, possibly reducing GDP and employment (and in that case, worsening the trade deficit in the end). The effects will be harsher when the home country's central bank policy interest rate is at or near zero'a circumstance Mundell did not consider. In that case, the central bank is more constrained in using monetary policy to offset the tariff's contractionary effect. **The effects of tariffs in two charts** The point is illustrated by the IMF's [Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model, which is more complicated than Mundell's framework and has the advantage of covering multiple regions and including the dynamic effects of policies. To demonstrate the potential effects, we chose a scenario in the charts below that show the response of four U.S. variables after the United States levies a 20 percent tariff on imports from emerging East Asia. The experiment assumes that the Federal Reserve policy interest rate is at zero, while emerging East Asia is not. (That assumption makes no qualitative difference to the results, but it does make the negative GDP impact harsher than it would be if the Fed could cut interest rates to cushion the economy.) Chart 1 below shows two scenarios, one in which emerging East Asia does not retaliate with its own tariff on U.S. imports (green line in the chart), and one in which it does (red line). Under either scenario, real GDP declines and, as Mundell predicted, the dollar is worth more. Not surprisingly, output in emerging East Asia (not shown) declines. With retaliation, the dollar appreciates by less, but U.S. GDP falls by far more. Also (not shown), real investment falls, due to both the activity decline in the U.S. and higher prices of East Asian intermediate imports used in making investment goods. [ One key behind the fall in GDP is that exports actually fall initially by _more_ than imports (see Chart 2). The rise in tariffs on East Asia leads importers to buy from other countries instead, and the dollar's appreciation reinforces the switch by making those alternative imports cheaper across the board. At the same time, the stronger dollar weighs on all U.S. exports. The main effect of the selective tariff is thus, broadly, to subsidize most imports and tax all exports. That hurts the trade balance, output, and employment. Moreover, in the United States, as in many countries, the export jobs that are lost tend to be relatively high paying. [ Who gains from the tariff? Because the United States is a large country, the tariff, if it does not provoke retaliation, raises the prices of U.S. exports relative to its imports, allowing higher real consumption. These consumer benefits, though, are spread widely and possibly thinly and must be weighed against job losses. Producers for the domestic market who compete directly with emerging East Asia also are likely to gain, though all other import- competing industries and exporters lose. Matters are much worse in case of retaliation, because then, everyone loses. **Think twice** Economic policies aimed at attaining an artificial export advantage are a legitimate topic for international consultation and peer pressure. In some cases, unilateral retaliation is sanctioned by WTO rules. But those who promote 'getting tough'\u009d with foreign trade partners through punitive tariffs should think carefully. It may be emotionally gratifying; it may boost specific industries; the threat may even frighten trade partners into changing their policies; but, ultimately, if carried out, such policies cause wider economic damage at home.

(Chinese) The word 'rebalancing'\u009d is often used to describe China's economic transition. But what does it mean? And how much is China rebalancing? A recent IMF [paper attempts to answer these questions. **1\\. The Scorecard: mixed progress** China's economy is like a large, high-powered ship that is still sailing fast, but in a lopsided way, listing and drawing water. 'Rebalancing'\u009d refers to the structural transformation that should put this economy on a more even keel, making its voyage more balanced, its growth more sustainable. This economic transformation has four inter-related dimensions: external, internal, environmental, and distributional. Overall progress since the global financial crisis has been mixed'strong on external rebalancing (i.e., switching from external demand to domestic demand in generating growth), and uneven on the other dimensions. The current account surplus has fallen from the pre-crisis peak of 10 percent of GDP to around 3 percent in recent years, and exports are no longer driving growth. [ **2\\. Consumers growing in importance** Until 2011, this reduction in the external imbalance was reflected in a growing internal imbalance as the investment to GDP ratio rose to even higher levels, reflecting the strong fiscal stimulus. Such rotation could be observed in Chart 1. Since 2012, however, internal rebalancing from investment to consumption has made headway, with a notable acceleration in 2015'consumption is now contributing more than two thirds of GDP growth. [ **3\\. Deindustrialization: speedy transition** China has made substantial progress on switching from industry to services. The speed of its transition is in line with international experience. [ **4\\. Credit: China's Achilles' heel** But, critically, progress has lagged on reducing reliance on credit. For example, credit intensity, the amount of new lending provided for each additional unit of output, has more than doubled since the global financial crisis. [ **5\\. Pollution and inequality: on the high side ** While the energy intensity of output has fallen, air pollution remained very high in cities. Similarly, income inequality remains very high, though labor's share of GDP is rising. [ [ **6\\. Falling savings ** With population ageing and the envisaged strengthening of social safety nets, household savings are expected to fall gradually and consumption to rise. This is good, as it will allow investment to moderate while keeping the current account balance broadly stable. The importance of the services sector will likely continue to increase, helping reduce environmental pressure and increase labor's share in national income. [ The structural transformation of the Chinese economy is a work in progress. The economy is rebalancing, but credit remains the Achilles' heel'absent decisive corporate restructuring and reform of state-owned enterprises, credit to the nonfinancial private sector will likely rise continuously, increasing the risk of disruptive adjustment.

This meeting comes at an important moment for the global economy. The political pendulum threatens to swing against economic openness, and without forceful policy actions, the world could suffer from disappointing growth for a long time. **2016 will be the fifth consecutive year with global GDP growth below its long-term average of 3.7 percent** (1990-2007), and 2017 may well be the sixth (Chart 1). Not since the early 1990s'when ripple effects from economic transition caused growth to slow'has the world economy been so weak for such a long time. What has happened? **In advanced economies, real growth is running almost a full percentage point below the average of 1990-2007.** * _**Many are still plagued by crisis legacies**,_ such as private and public sector debt overhangs, and impaired balance sheets of financial institutions. The result has been stubbornly weak demand. * **_The longer demand weakness lasts, the more it threatens to harm long-term growth_** as firms reduce production capacity and unemployed workers are leaving the labor force and critical skills are eroding. Weak demand also depresses trade, which adds to disappointing productivity growth. * **_On the supply side, slowing productivity and adverse demographic trends are weighing on potential growth_**'a trend that started before the global financial crisis. And with little expectation of stronger growth tomorrow, firms have even less incentive to invest, which hurts both productivity and short-term growth prospects. **Emerging economies have also been slowing'but from an exceptionally fast pace of growth in the past decade.** Their slowdown is therefore more a return to the historical norm. Developments _within_ emerging economies are quite diverse. In 2015, for example, GDP in two of the four largest economies'China and India'grew between 7-7\u00c2? percent, while GDP contracted by close to 4 percent in the other two'Russia and Brazil. But there are important common factors: * **_One is the rebalancing of the Chinese economy from investment to consumption, and from external demand to domestic demand_**_._ While a stable Chinese economy growing at sustainable rates is ultimately good for the world economy, the transition is costly for trading partners that rely on Chinese demand for their exports. It can also trigger bouts of financial volatility along the way. * **_The second, related, development is the large decline in commodity prices_**, which has taken a toll on disposable income for many commodity exporters. The adjustment of commodity exporters to this new reality will be difficult and protracted. In some cases, it calls for a change in their growth model. **Weak global growth that interacts with rising inequality is feeding a political climate in which reforms stall and countries resort to inward-looking policies.** In a broad cross-section of advanced economies, incomes for the top 10 percent increased by about 40 percent in the past 20 years, while growing only very modestly at the bottom (Chart 2). Inequality has also increased in many emerging economies, although the impact on the poor has sometimes been offset by strong general income growth. **Forceful policy actions are needed to avoid what I fear could become a low-growth trap. **Here are the key elements of a global growth agenda as I see them: * **_The first element is demand support_** in economies that operate below capacity. In recent years, this task has been delegated mostly to central banks. But monetary policy is increasingly stretched, as several central banks are operating at or close to the effective lower bound for policy rates. This means fiscal policy has a larger role to play. Where there is fiscal space, record-low interest rates make for an excellent time to boost public investment and upgrade infrastructure. * **_The second element is structural reforms_.** Countries are not doing nearly enough in this area. Two years ago, the members of the G20 pledged reforms that would lift their collective GDP by an additional two percent over 5 years. But in the most recent assessment, the measures implemented to date are worth at most half this amount'so more reforms are urgent. IMF research shows that reforms are most effective when they are prioritized along countries' reform gaps and take into account the level of development and position in the business cycle. * **_The third element is reinvigorating trade _**by reducing trade costs and rolling back temporary trade barriers. It is easy to blame trade for all the ills afflicting a country'but curbing free trade would be stalling an engine that has brought unprecedented welfare gains around the world over many decades. However, to make trade work for all, policymakers should help those who are adversely affected through re-training, skill building, and assisting occupational and geographic mobility. * **_Finally, policies need to ensure that growth is shared more broadly._** Taxes and benefits should bolster incomes at the low end and reward work. In many emerging economies, stronger social safety nets are needed. Investments in education can raise both productivity and the prospects of low-wage earners. **It takes political courage to implement this agenda.** But inaction risks reversing global economic integration, and therefore stalling an engine that, for decades, has created and spread wealth around the globe. This risk is, in my view, too large to take.

This question is getting much-deserved attention. Let's abstract from macroeconomic (business cycle) considerations and look at the issue purely from an optimal tax smoothing perspective'that is, weighing the cost and benefits of raising taxes to pay down debt. By doing so we decidedly do not engage in the current debate about the contribution that fiscal policy may make to demand management. In advanced economies, the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached the highest level on record since 1950 (Chart 1). The increase in debt has been particularly pronounced since the beginning of the Great Recession, when many governments stepped in to rescue their financial system and stimulate economic activity'at the expense of a substantial increase in general government's liabilities. In an era of low inflation and low growth, deleveraging is difficult. At the same time, with bond yields at historical lows, fiscal policy has been called upon to play a more active role to head off a new mediocre of subpar growth and extremely low inflation. In an [interesting paper published last year, our IMF colleagues Jonathan Ostry, Atish Gosh and Raphael Espinoza argued that countries can live with high debt under certain assumptions (for example, continuous access to financing).They look at the interaction between tax smoothing and productive public investment in determining optimal policy. In their model, high public debt ratios are bad for standards of living (or growth) because they imply higher tax rates. Nevertheless, after a sharp increase in the debt ratio, taxes should be increased only to the extent necessary to stabilize it. Pushing taxation further up to reduce debt would not be optimal because the excess burden of taxation increases more than proportionally to the tax rate. The contribution of Ostry et al. was to show that from the fact that public debt is bad for growth (or the standards of living) it does not necessarily follow that governments should actively pursue debt reduction policies. The authors stress that governments should nevertheless be opportunistic in reducing public debt, for instance when there are privatization receipts, licensing royalties, or economic booms that yield exceptionally high revenues In a [recent working paper, we follow their contribution but simplify the framework by disregarding public investment and by directly postulating the normative goal of minimizing the excess burden of taxation. But, on the other hand, we extend it by taking into consideration the empirical fact that financial crises, natural disasters, and wars are repeated events, with sizable implications for public finances. Moreover, we were motivated by the perception that risks to public finances are asymmetric: large, positive disturbances to the public debt ratio are much more likely than negative shocks of similar magnitude ([IMF, 2016). To put it simply, sudden surges in debt ratios from, say, wars or bank bailouts are more common than sudden drops of debt ratios from, say, privatizations or licenses. To document this asymmetry, we looked at the long-term trends of debt ratios in the United States and the United Kingdom using historical time series. In the last 200 years, these two countries provided the ultimate safe asset to the world economy and data are available for both (see Chart 2, for the U.S., and Chart 3, for the U.K.). Chart 2a and 3a show the historical behavior of the debt ratio over the period 1790 to 2014. The pattern is striking: long periods of persistent, gradual declines punctuated by occasional sharp increases. Charts 2b and 3b show the histogram of changes in the debt ratio, which suggests that the distribution is skewed to the right. In the paper, we confirm this visual impression through a battery of statistical tests. Those allow for the rejection of symmetry. How often and at what scale do surges in debt ratios occur? In the United Kingdom, we observe on average a (positive) outlier year every 28 years with an average increase in the debt ratio of 30.8 percentage points of GDP. The corresponding numbers for the United States are an outlier every 32 years on average with an average increase in the debt ratio of 15.4 percentage points of GDP. To prevent debt from ratcheting up because of such future shocks, the debt ratio needs to decline in normal years, as insurance. Our computations show that, indeed, the average decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio was 1.3 percentage points of GDP in the UK and 0.3 in the United States. The corresponding model normative benchmarks are, respectively, 1.1 and 0.5 percentage points. Surprisingly, the actual behavior of public debt in the two countries that have provided the ultimate safe asset to the world economy, over the last 200 years, is close to the normative implications of the model. The key to optimal tax smoothing is small but enduring public debt reductions in normal years.

This could cause productivity growth to decline in the years ahead, raising another policy challenge for governments already dealing with legacies from the crisis such as high unemployment and debt. The euro area's population is expected to grow significantly older over the next couple of decades. This has two components. First, the number of retirees is set to grow compared to the people of working age (15'64) in the region. Second, and much less examined, the average age of people _within_ the labor force will rise: the share of workers aged 55'64 is forecast to increase by a third, from 15 percent to 20 percent, over the next two decades (Chart 1). [ What is the likely impact of such workforce aging? If different age cohorts within the workforce have different levels of productivity, then clearly average productivity will be affected by changes in the age distribution. But in which direction? There are several different theories regarding age-related effects on productivity. On the one hand, accumulated years of work experience could make older workers more productive. On the other hand, frailer health and obsolete skills could reduce their productivity, at least beyond a certain threshold. While it is difficult to generalize across occupations, the consensus in the literature is that productivity increases with age at first, peaking sometime in the 40s or 50s. Then it diminishes. **Empirical estimates** We use a sample of European countries from 1950 to 2014 to examine the relationship between workforce aging and labor productivity. Correcting for various econometric pitfalls'such as reverse causality'we find that workforce aging significantly reduces output per worker. A five percentage point increase in the share of workers aged 55'64 is associated with a decrease in labor productivity of about three percent. Changes in labor productivity'that is, output per worker'can themselves be broken down into changes in the amount of physical and human capital used, and total factor productivity, which ultimately measures the efficiency with which an economy converts inputs into outputs. In the long run, total factor productivity is by far the most important driver of economic growth. We find that total factor productivity is the main channel through which workforce aging affects labor productivity. In particular, a five percentage point increase in the share of workers aged 55'64 is associated with a decrease in total factor productivity of somewhere between two and four percent. **What does this imply for euro area countries?** First, aging will take a considerable toll on productivity growth over the medium- to long-term. As shown in Chart 2, average total factor productivity growth in the euro area is forecast to be around 0.8 percent per year. This could be higher by a quarter'that is to say, total factor productivity could increase to about one percent per year'if we shut down the effect of workforce aging. This result stands in stark contrast to the United States, where the workforce is not projected to age at all (in fact, it is projected to become slightly younger), and hence the impact on total factor productivity is negligible. [ Second, the burden of workforce aging will fall unequally across euro area member states. Worryingly, some of the largest adverse effects on productivity will fall on countries that can least afford it, such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. These countries already have elevated debt levels and meager fiscal space, and need rapid productivity growth to build competitiveness and bring down unemployment. **What can policy do?** The good news is that policy matters. We find that a number of policies can mitigate the adverse impact of workforce aging on productivity growth (Chart 3). Health conditions'measured in our study by the availability of doctors'are particularly important. Sufficient improvements in this indicator have the potential to substantially reduce the negative effects of aging on productivity. While good quality healthcare is clearly beneficial to all age groups, older age groups are likely to use medical services to a greater extent, and thus will benefit disproportionately from public interventions to improve healthcare. [ Active labor market policies focused on worker training or re-training are another important avenue for mitigating the impact of aging. As with better health care, such training programs are likely to be disproportionately beneficial to senior workers, since their skills will typically lag behind evolving new technologies and job requirements. Other public policies'such as reducing the difference between gross income and after-tax income by cutting the rate of tax on marginal employment, and investing in research and development'can also help.

Power is influence, and it is also the ability to do what you want without having to worry about what others want, according to Cohen. The United States dollar has been a dominant currency because the U.S. economy has dominated since World War II. What makes the dollar attractive, according to Cohen, is the U.S. financial market. The dollar offers liquidity advantages that no other does. Cohen describes what he calls a currency pyramid, which includes the U.S. dollar at the very peak. It has universal scope and domain.

The move complemented a series of other easing measures aimed at bringing inflation back to the ECB's price stability objective of below, but close to, two percent over the medium term. A negative policy rate makes sense. When commercial banks are charged (rather than remunerated) to deposit their excess liquidity at the ECB, they should be more inclined to lend to consumers and companies. Consumers would then buy more goods, and companies would invest in new productive capacity. Faster economic growth would help prevent inflation from sinking too low'or even becoming negative'which is a sign of economic malaise. For a long time, many economists and policymakers believed that central banks could not cut the policy rate below zero. If they did, the argument went, commercial banks would have to respond by charging their own customers for deposits. As a result, companies and households would start withdrawing cash and stash it under the proverbial mattress ([Bech and Malkhozov, 2016). But not going below zero percent meant that so-called _real_ interest rates'nominal rates minus inflation'could not fall further when inflation was too low. And real interest rates that were too high would hold back investment and consumption. In fact, in the euro area, real rates were likely still well above the rate required to raise output to its potential level (technically, the 'natural'\u009d rate of interest). So, to push real rates lower, the ECB would have to cut the nominal policy rate below zero. **Track record of negative interest rates** What has been the track record of the ECB's negative rate policy'also adopted by other central banks, notably in Japan and Switzerland'after two years? Our [paper finds that, so far, it has been successful. The rate cut has eased financial conditions, reducing the cost of borrowing for both banks and their customers ([ECB, 2016; [Heider and others, 2016). Lower funding costs for banks have also strengthened the ECB's 'forward guidance,'\u009d meaning its commitment to keep rates low for an extended period. Lower borrowing rates for both households and firms have also contributed to a modest credit expansion'favorable to growth and inflation. Finally, the ECB's deposit rate cuts have helped amplify the impact of its asset purchases, which are intended to spur markets and the economy. That is because banks have reduced their cash balances and instead invested it in riskier, but higher- yielding, assets. [ However, there are unique challenges to negative rates in the euro area. Since the ECB charges interest only on excess liquidity, the charge is greater in those countries where banks hold large excess reserves. These are generally countries with substantial current account surpluses vis-\u00c3 -vis other members of the monetary union. At the same time, banks' ability to generate interest revenues for each euro of assets has suffered because their reliance on a wide deposit base has prevented them from cutting the amount they pay for customer deposits as much as that they charge for loans. And in several large economies, loans are typically indexed to the policy rate (so-called 'variable rate loans'\u009d). Banks in these countries face reduced margins not just on new lending, but also on existing loans, as discussed in the IMF's [April issue of the GFSR (Chart 1). [ To some extent banks have been able to mitigate the squeeze on profitability with higher lending volumes, lower interest expenses, capital gains from investments, lower risk provisioning, small increases in fees and commissions, as well as savings from cost cutting ([Rostagno and others, 2016). But there are clearly limits to such mitigation measures. **Diminishing returns** Overall, the ECB has limited room for further substantial rate cuts without hurting the profitability of banks. As outlined in our [paper and in the [IMF staff report on the euro area, the prospect of prolonged low policy rates has clouded the earnings outlook for most banks, suggesting that the benefits from a negative interest rate policy might diminish over time, while future lending growth may be insufficient to offset declining interest margins in some countries (Chart 2). Further policy rate cuts could bring into focus the potential trade-off between effective monetary transmission and bank profitability. Lower bank profitability and equity prices could pressure banks with slender capital buffers to reduce lending, especially those with high levels of troubled loans (Charts 3 and 4). [ Therefore, looking ahead, the ECB may need to rely more on purchases of assets. Additional rate cuts could weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy if lending rates fail to adjust or customers withdraw cash from banks. Focusing on asset purchases would raise asset prices and aggregate demand, while also supporting bank lending. This would also facilitate the pass- through of improved bank funding conditions to the real economy.

(Chinese) A single policy could do it all for China. A carbon tax'an upstream tax on the carbon content of fossil fuel supply'could dramatically cut greenhouse gases, save millions of lives, soothe the government's fiscal anxieties, and boost green growth. According to IMF estimates, a tax on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, rising by $5 per year between 2017 and 2030, could reduce CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030, well in excess of what is needed to fulfill China's pledge for the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The carbon tax could also save close to 4 million lives during this 14-year period (Figure 1), principally by deterring use of coal, the main source of the fine particulates that elevate the risk of strokes, heart, and lung diseases. And the tax would raise well over 2 percent of GDP in new revenue by 2030, a huge bonus which represents more than enough to double government spending on healthcare. [ In fact, this is good news for the planet given that China is by far the world's leading producer of CO2 emissions, contributing 25 percent to the global total in 2013, compared with 16 and 6 percent from the United States and India, respectively, the world's second and third largest emitters. **Predicting the effects of a carbon tax** These [findings are based on a new spreadsheet tool developed at the IMF, for projecting future fuel use by economic sector. Using assumptions about how fuel demand would respond to price changes, and [previous IMF estimates of local air pollution deaths from fuel combustion for China, we are able to assess the carbon, public health, and fiscal impacts of carbon taxation. The future is of course inherently uncertain so the numbers should not be taken too literally, but they do at least provide a broad indication of the likely impacts of carbon taxes. **Moving it forward** Administering a carbon tax is straightforward. It involves a tax on fossil fuel products at their point of entry in the economy with rates levied on coal, petroleum products, and natural gas based on the tons of CO2 produced per unit of fuel. The government could collect the tax at the mine mouth for coal (where royalties are already collected) or at coal processing plants, at the refinery for petroleum products, at the border for imported fuel products, and so on. Yes, downsides exist, but they are manageable. The most difficult challenge is dealing with the burden of higher energy prices on vulnerable groups, though impacts should not be overstated'in 2020, for example, the carbon tax raises electricity prices by around 5 percent. Our analysis reveals that a carbon tax imposes a disproportionately large burden on low income households, 50 and 25 percent larger for the lowest 20 percent of income earners, compared with the top ten percent of income earners, given that low income households spend a greater share of their budget on energy. The good news is that only about 5 percent of the carbon tax revenues would be needed to compensate the bottom twenty percent, for example, through reduced social security contributions and increased welfare and social spending (areas where China has been lagging relative to advanced and other middle income countries). How about the impact on export sectors? Here again, our analysis shows that exporting sectors do not bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden compared with other sectors. Moreover, compensation for these industries would again use up a minor fraction (at most 10 percent) of carbon tax revenues. Any compensation should be temporary however, as firms that cannot compete with energy efficiently priced should eventually cease operation. And the needed compensation could be smaller if more countries follow China's and others' lead to mitigate emissions. **To tax or trade?** As China continues its transition to a sustainable growth path, a carbon tax can be a powerful policy to support economic re-balancing and improve the environment. It is true that China has already committed to introducing a nationwide emissions trading system (ETS) in 2017 for large industrial sources. A carbon tax is still imperative, however, because by comprehensively covering fuels and emissions, it has about twice the environmental and revenue impacts of an equivalently scaled ETS. There is no reason the tax cannot be introduced in tandem with the ETS for the interim (perhaps allowing carbon tax refunds for entities required to obtain emissions permits), as what matters is establishing a robust and far-reaching emissions price to reap the badly needed health and fiscal benefits'while at the same time taking a major step forward in addressing the global environmental challenge of our time. ", "index": 93}, {"pub": "7/26/2016", "title": "The Lowdown on U.S. Core Inflation", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=13903", "content": " By **[Yasser Abdih** There was a time when U.S. central bankers worried that inflation was too high, and they tried to bring it down. Now the opposite is true: the Federal Reserve is concerned that inflation has remained stubbornly low, and it's trying to boost prices. The reason: persistently low inflation raises the risk that prices will actually start to decline, a dangerous condition known as deflation. That's bad news because it makes people less willing to borrow and spend'anticipating lower prices, consumers will put off spending'and could also lead to a fall in wages. To avoid such a damaging spiral of falling prices and wages, the Fed targets a 2 percent inflation rate. That's one half of its so-called dual mandate of price stability and full employment. And while the Fed has managed to bring the unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent, inflation has remained below its goal. Low unemployment without an acceleration in inflation has also raised the question of whether the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (known as the Phillips curve) has weakened or even disappeared post-Great Recession. In econspeak, has the Phillips curve become flatter? Our [new study looks at the individual components of inflation to better understand its relationship to unemployment. We find that a fairly flat Phillips curve plus global forces have conspired to keep core inflation down. These findings have implications for the future path of interest rates. **A weak relationship** Recent [IMF research finds no evidence for a change in the slope of the Phillips curve post-Great Recession. In other words, the authors find that the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment has not changed. Rather, what appears to have changed after the global financial crisis has been the nature of economic shocks that have hit the U.S. economy. These shocks, such as weaker global growth, have been disinflationary and kept inflation low even in the face of a labor market that is approaching full employment. The result is a weakening in the correlation between unemployment and inflation. Our parallel work reaches a similar conclusion but from a different perspective. We focus on so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, and has been persistently below 2 percent (see Chart 1). Because of such volatility, core inflation is a better predictor of longer-term price trends. By looking at the individual components that feed into core inflation, we find that the slope of the Phillips curve'that is, the responsiveness of inflation to changes in unemployment, all else held constant'has been the same over the past 20 years or so and has not changed after the global financial crisis. The slope, though, is very flat. In particular, a one percentage point decline in unemployment only nudges core inflation up by a cumulative 0.1 percentage points over the following two years. **Bottoms up!** Taking a deeper bottom-up look at inflation dynamics reveals that foreign rather than domestic factors are keeping core inflation low. Specifically, falling core prices of goods being exported to the United States from China, Canada, the euro area and Mexico, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar have both significantly reduced non-oil import price inflation, which, in turn, have resulted in falling domestic core goods prices (see Chart 2). Low imported inflation has also played a role in holding back core services inflation (but to a lesser extent than core goods inflation). However, declining unemployment and expectations that inflation will ultimately return to its target'bolstered by Fed credibility'have been offsetting factors, particularly for housing services. **The elusive quest for higher inflation** Using a disaggregated approach to forecast inflation reveals that the United States is likely to face challenges getting inflation back to the Fed's medium-term goal of 2 percent. Indeed, it would take the combination of a depreciation of the U.S. dollar, a continued decline in the unemployment rate (which is already quite low), a pick-up in house price inflation, and rising wages in the health sector (which has a large weight in core inflation) to generate inflation much above 2 percent (see the upside scenario in the Chart 3). The monetary policy implications of the benchmark scenario'which entails more conservative assumptions, including a constant dollar and house price inflation'are clear. The Fed's low interest rate policy has been appropriate and future interest rate increases will need to proceed cautiously and gradually to ensure that inflation gets back to 2 percent target over the next few years.

The IMF's recent [forecast for global growth is a disappointing 3.1 percent in 2016 and 3.4 percent in 2017. And the outlook remains clouded by increased economic and political uncertainty, including from the impact of the Brexit vote. Policymakers have taken forceful macroeconomic policy action to support growth, such as fiscal stimulus and appropriately accommodative monetary policy. But a lasting recovery remains elusive. What needs to be done to rev up the global growth engine? The world's largest economies need more structural reform. This was a key theme at the G-20 meetings this past weekend in Chengdu, China, and has in fact been a major focus of the G-20 under the Chinese presidency. The IMF's [April 2016 World Economic Outlook has also highlighted the key role of structural reforms in boosting economic growth, specifically the impact of labor and product market reforms on growth in advanced economies. And a [new staff paper pulls together our specific structural reform recommendations for G-20 countries. **Choosing the right structural reforms** There are many different areas in which [structural reforms'or measures that make the institutional and regulatory framework more supportive of economic growth'can help boost productivity. These include labor and product market regulation, trade policy, taxation, and the financial sector. With so many potential areas to work on, how should policymakers prioritize their efforts? IMF research finds that structural reforms will work best when they are well aligned with a country's macroeconomic conditions. Our [Guiding Framework for Structural Reforms sets out three key considerations: * First, the economy's _level of development_ helps determine which reforms are likely to have the greatest productivity pay-off. In advanced economies, reforms that foster innovation. In emerging markets, reforms that improve the way markets function are likely to matter more. * Second, the economy's _position in the business cycle _also matters. The weaker the economy, the more important it is to choose reforms that will support growth in the short term _and_ the long term. Infrastructure investment is a good example'it boosts growth today, through investment and job creation; and it boosts growth tomorrow, by improving productive capacity. The state of the economy can also make a big difference for the impact of structural reforms. For example, in good economic times, labor market deregulation can make employers more willing to hire new workers, which boosts growth. But if the outlook is poor, deregulation could actually lead to job losses in the short term, because it will be easier to lay people off. * A third important consideration is _macroeconomic policy space_. As I just mentioned, some structural reforms will be more successful when economic prospects are looking up. So demand support can be critical for enhancing the impact of structural reforms. Such support can also help offset possible short-term costs of supply measures. For example, extra support for those who become unemployed as a result of labor market deregulation can be critical. The benefits also work the other way around'some structural reforms can help increase macroeconomic policy space. Labor and product market reforms that increase competition and lower prices can create space for monetary easing. Structural reforms can also help generate space for discretionary fiscal policy. Measures that boost growth in the medium term will also increase tax revenue. These together'higher output and higher revenue'will lower the ratio of public debt to GDP down the road. So this helps increase fiscal space today. **So what does all this mean in practice?** At the IMF, we are using the framework explained above to guide our policy advice. In **advanced economies, **we are focusing on measures that raise both short- and medium-term growth. These include recommending that countries like Australia, Canada, and Germany increase public spending on infrastructure investment. We are also recommending reforms that help broaden full-time employment opportunities for women in countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the US. Where policy space is limited, for example in Italy, product market deregulation is particularly recommended for raising investment, employment, and output without generating budgetary costs in the short run. Interactions across these different reforms are also factored into IMF advice. For example, tax simplification and broadening measures in the U.S. can reduce inefficiencies, generating revenues to finance other high pay-off (but costly) reforms. Given that most **emerging markets** are in weaker economic condition and have limited fiscal space, we are focusing on structural reforms that can also deliver payoffs in the near term. These include better management of public investment processes in India, product market reforms in China, and labor market reforms in South Africa. Our recommendations also address trade and FDI impediments'for example in Brazil, India, and Indonesia'as well as governance of public institutions and other institutional reforms. Where fiscal space is limited or consolidation is necessary, we are encouraging governments to adjust the composition of fiscal policy to make it more growth-friendly. **Policy synergies** Ahead of the Hangzhou Summit this September, G-20 member countries are making new structural reform commitments. To ensure maximum impact, policymakers need to implement them as part of a comprehensive policy package, with demand and supply policies complementing each other. And to ensure inclusive impact, they must be supported by policies that cushion those who may suffer short-term costs under these reforms. For reforms to be effective, they need to benefit not just some, but all.

Released earlier this week, the IMF's [update to the global economic outlook expects global growth at 3.1 percent and 3.4 percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively, slightly down from April estimates. The global outlook, which was set for a small upward revision prior to the U.K.'s referendum, has been revised downward, reflecting the increased economic, political, and institutional uncertainty. The setback from 'Brexit'\u009d adds to mounting concerns that a sustained recovery'with more jobs, higher living standards, and declining debt levels'remains elusive. The risks of a slow growth environment go beyond pure economic costs'they could spur social tensions and the risk of protectionism that could further hurt the global economy. Adding to uncertain economic prospects, increasing geopolitical risks have cast a shadow over the global economy. How to power the global growth engine will be one of the key themes of the G-20 meetings this weekend in Chengdu, China. An [IMF staff note for the G-20 outlines the urgent need for a broad-based policy effort to contain risk and reinvigorate growth both in the short and longer term. The _Note_ explores five main areas to rev up growth. These include: * **Reducing uncertainty around 'Brexit'\u009d** and its repercussions, through a smooth transition to a new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union that as much as possible preserves gains from trade. * **Implementing a stronger and more balanced set of economic policies** that exploits policy synergies of well-sequenced structural reforms with growth friendly fiscal policy and continued monetary support. * **Addressing the post-crisis debt overhang** that saddles advanced economies and the rising corporate debt that burdens many emerging economies. * **Lifting long-term growth and making it more inclusive**, through structural reforms by making workers and business processes more productive. * **Reinvigorating trade,** making sure that the gains from trade are widely shared, and reviving the spirit of multilateralism, including to address geopolitical spillovers that could threaten the global recovery. The G-20 growth strategy stresses the need for more _inclusive_ and _sustainable_ growth. The bottom line, however, is that strong global growth will not return without decisive policy action.

But the outlook for the region is still uncertain. Commodity prices have recovered since their February 2016 trough, but they are still expected to remain low for the foreseeable future. This has been accompanied by a brake'or even a reversal'in the large exchange rate depreciations in some of the largest economies in the region. Most recently, the U.K. referendum on Brexit led to a sharp increase in volatility in global financial markets, especially in equity prices and exchange rates. While direct trade exposures of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to the U.K. are small (on average about 1 percent of total exports), the region is exposed to the [broader slowdown in the rest of the world'through trade and financial linkages'and fickle investor sentiment. At the same time, however, a more gradual pace of monetary normalization in the United States, with compressed U.S. term premium, should help contain funding cost pressures for both the public and private sector. Taking all this into account, the growth outlook for the region for 2016 and 2017 has been revised up modestly'by 0.1 percentage points both years relative to the April 2016 forecasts (see table). Following the small contraction of activity in the region in 2015, we expect economic activity to contract by 0.4 percent this year (slightly better than the -0.5 percent envisaged in the April 2016 projections), followed by a modest rebound in growth in 2017 to 1.6 percent. But frequent bouts of increased financial market volatility, even if short-lived, are a constant reminder that benign market conditions can flip overnight. Such global volatility could also feed into corporate sector vulnerabilities, given increased debt burdens and lower profitability. **Mixed growth performance** Growth performances continue to differ across the region, due to a combination of external and domestic forces. **_South America: an interplay between trade and domestic factors_** **Chile**, **Peru, and Colombia** continue an orderly adjustment in response to a relatively sizable terms-of-trade shock (sharp drop in export revenues). **Chile's** growth outlook was revised slightly up to 1.7 percent in 2016 as momentum into the year was stronger than anticipated. The investment outlook, however, remains weak, with lower and more uncertain copper prices stalling mining investment, and weak external demand and uncertainties related to an incomplete delivery of the reform agenda delaying non-mining investment. Overall, monetary accommodation and a credible fiscal framework have helped smooth the impact of low copper prices and weak global demand. In **Peru**, growth has been supported by increased production in primary sectors, as long-planned mining projects came online, and is expected to gain further momentum in 2016 (3.7 percent) and 2017 (4.1 percent). Continuing with education reforms, increasing labor market flexibility, reducing red tape, and rationalizing fiscal decentralization are the policy priorities_._ In **Colombia**, a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy tightening will help contain the current account deficit and inflationary effects from weather- related and exchange rate shocks. Recent advances in the peace process have increased prospects of a near-term final agreement, which would further boost market confidence and spur growth. The authorities' infrastructure agenda is on track and should also help boost growth over the medium-term. In **Brazil**, GDP continued to contract in the first quarter, but by a lesser extent than expected, implying that the widely anticipated contraction for 2016 will be less sharp than previously envisaged. The economy is expected to hit bottom this year, and 2017 should see some positive growth in economic activity, although the elevated level of unemployment will be a drag on domestic demand. The interim government has outlined a gradual deficit reduction strategy that aims to curtail unsustainable spending pressures over the medium term. The proposed consolidation strategy has been broadly welcomed by markets, and the government needs to focus on overcoming implementation challenges. In **Argentina**, the transition to a more coherent and credible macroeconomic policy framework continues, and should bolster medium-term growth prospects, although the adverse impact on activity in the near term has been greater than previously expected. The relative price adjustment in the first half of 2016'following the exchange rate depreciation and increase in utilities tariffs'has accelerated inflation and hurt private consumption. Economic activity is now likely to begin recovering toward the end of 2016, as inflation moderates gradually, spending is boosted, and interest rates are lowered. The easier monetary and fiscal policy stance is expected to support growth in 2017, but would make meeting inflation and fiscal targets announced earlier this year more challenging. In **Ecuador**, in addition to the adverse impact of the April earthquake, the economy continues to endure the effects of low oil prices, a strong U.S. dollar, and tight financing conditions. It is expected to contract this year, but at a milder pace than projected earlier, due to the relative recovery in oil prices and more availability of external financing (mainly from China). Financing provided by the IMF under the Rapid Financing Instrument should help the country meet balance of payments needs due to the damages caused by the earthquake. In **Uruguay**, growth has come to a virtual halt. However, with inflation well above the target range and public debt rising, there is little room for countercyclical policies. Efforts should focus on structural reforms, such as improving the quality and enrollment of secondary education, upgrading infrastructure, and enhancing labor market efficiency to better tie wages to productivity, to boost the economy's productive potential. **Venezuela**'s economic condition continues to deteriorate, as policy distortions and fiscal imbalances remain unaddressed. Economic activity is expected to contract by 10 percent in 2016, and inflation is expected to exceed 700 percent, marking the worst growth and inflation performance in the world. **_Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean: benefiting from the U.S. recovery_** **Mexico** is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace, although a relatively weak performance of U.S. industrial production would increase risks. It will be important to proceed with planned fiscal consolidation and the restructuring of Pemex (the state-owned oil company) to maintain market confidence. The central bank increased policy rates recently to ensure that inflation remains close to the target. In the context of ongoing fiscal consolidation and well-anchored inflation expectations, it would be important to keep the monetary policy stance relatively accommodative. **Central America and the Dominican Republic** have continued to benefit from low oil prices, a stronger U.S. growth, and higher remittances, despite a small downward revision related to the the U.S. outlook. These countries should use the relatively favorable external conditions to strengthen their fiscal positions (Costa Rica, El Salvador), protect financial stability (Honduras, Panama), and adopt reforms to boost potential growth. Likewise, tourism-based countries in **the Caribbean** are benefiting from the U.S. recovery, although risks are increasing from Zika, [the withdrawal of global banks, and Brexit. Conversely, still low commodity prices continue to weigh on growth prospects for commodity-based economies in the Caribbean. Addressing fiscal vulnerabilities, strengthening the financial sector, and boosting long-run growth are the key policy objectives for most countries. **How to stabilize and boost growth** Given the sizable terms-of-trade shocks and increased volatility in global financial markets, exchange rate flexibility remains the first line of defense. Reassuringly, in countries with well-established inflation-targeting frameworks, large exchange rate depreciations have had a relatively limited pass-through to domestic inflation (see Chart 1). Clear central bank communication continues to be key in keeping inflation expectations well anchored. Fiscal space remains limited across most countries in the region, and particularly so for commodity exporters, given still low commodity prices and recent bouts of volatility. Preserving policy buffers remains vital in case further risks materialize. A faster pace of adjustment is warranted for countries with large debt burdens and sizable market pressures (see Chart 2). Countries benefiting from a positive external environment and decent growth should also use this period to strengthen their fiscal positions. Finally, now would be the right time to address bottlenecks to reinvigorate potential growth in the region. Policies aiming at improving education and infrastructure, and strengthening the rule of law would help support growth and increase resilience to shocks.

The inflow of capital and innovation has led to better institutions, better economic management, and higher efficiency. On the flip side, it has also led to sizable and persistent outflow of people. Close to 20 million, mostly young and skilled Eastern Europeans'equal to the combined population of the Czech Republic and Hungary'left their countries over the past 25 years to seek better opportunities abroad (Chart 1). And even as they have contributed to the riches of the receiving countries and the EU as a whole, their departure has slowed growth and convergence of their home countries to the living standards of advanced Europe. A [study by IMF staff proposes policy options to balance the scales. [ **Emigration slowed growth in Eastern Europe** Economic migration is driven by personal choices. For Eastern Europeans, the motivation to leave is mainly better jobs and higher pay (Chart 2). Many of these economic migrants are highly skilled (e.g., doctors, architects, engineers) and younger than the average person at home. The less effective the government and the weaker the institutions (guarding the rule of law, upholding accountability and fighting corruption) in their home countries, the more likely the young and educated are to seek better opportunities abroad. While emigrants themselves tend to be better off and their families back home often benefit from remittances, their departure weakens the economic potential of their home countries. [ This has left Eastern European countries worse off (Chart 3). Large and persistent emigration appears to have slowed both overall and per capita output growth rates. In the absence of emigration between 1995 and 2012, real GDP growth would have been altogether 7 percentage points higher on the average in the region, according to analytical work by IMF staff. Some skills are in short supply, lowering productivity growth in the East. And while the large inflow of remittances has supported investment and consumption, it also led to exchange rate appreciation, making economies less competitive. Moreover, the money sent back to relatives pushed up starting wages and reduced incentives to work. As a result, wages have risen faster than productivity, eroding returns on investment and weakening incentives to invest in home countries. [ With lower output, government spending on social benefits has increased in relation to GDP. The departure of the young adds to the already existing trend of the elderly occupying an increasing share in the population, leading to more spending on retirement benefits relative to GDP. Governments have tended to respond to these budgetary pressures by raising labor taxes that lower employers' incentives to create jobs, thus making budgetary structure even less jobs and growth friendly. The departure of some of the youngest and brightest makes Eastern Europe's process of catching up to advanced Europe more challenging. **Boon for Europe as a whole** How about the impact of the east-west migration on receiving countries? The westward migration seems to have contributed to stronger growth in Western European countries and been an economic boon for the European Union as a whole. As such, economic migration is an indicator of success of the European Union project, which sees freedom of movement as necessary for greater economic integration and, ultimately, higher incomes for all. With income and institutional differences between East and West remaining wide, the push and pull factors driving emigration from the east are likely to persist for some time. What's more, the trends could further intensify with new countries getting ready to join the European Union. **Making it work for all** Overall, European Union membership brought substantial benefit for Eastern Europe. Now what can be done to ensure that the free flow of people leads to a win-win outcome for both labor sending and receiving countries? Although there are some tasks to be done locally, there is also room for a pan-European response. * **For Eastern Europe****:** better institutions and economic policies in home countries would make it more attractive for people to stay, for emigrants to return, and for people from other countries to seek jobs in Eastern Europe. Further liberalization of immigration regimes, especially for skilled workers, could be considered as well. Governments can do more to work with diasporas abroad in order to leverage their expertise and savings, and to provide more incentives for people to invest rather than spend remittances. In addition, more can be done to retain and better use the existing workforce, for example, through better matching of education to employment needs and providing more opportunities for on-the-job training. The choice of policy responses to emigration-related fiscal pressures matters as well: avoiding increases in labor taxes and relying more on consumption taxes would be more conducive for investment and long-run growth. * **For the European Union:** given that the East-West migration has benefited the European Union as a whole, there is a case for better redistributing the gains. For example, the size and composition of the European Union structural and cohesion funds'transfers from wealthier to poorer European Union regions'could explicitly account for the negative effects of emigration on sending countries' economic potential. This would also be consistent with the European Union's goal of reducing economic and social disparities across regions and promoting sustainable development.

The first half of 2016 revealed some promising signs'for example, stronger than expected growth in the euro area and Japan, as well as a partial recovery in commodity prices that helped several emerging and developing economies. As of June 22, we were therefore prepared to upgrade our 2016-17 global growth projections slightly. But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works. **The new **[**_World Economic Outlook Update_****, released today, reports our revised analysis.** Our April outlook was for 3.2 percent global output growth in 2016 and 3.5 percent in 2017. For today's update, we have reduced both of those projections by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1 and 3.4 percent, respectively. Relative to the April baseline scenario, the new baseline concentrates the growth slowdown through 2017 in the advanced countries. Outside the advanced economies, gains in the emerging group are matched by losses in low-income economies. The growth reduction for sub-Saharan Africa'driven by the difficult macroeconomic situation in its largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa'has a dramatic implication: in 2016, regional output growth will fall short of population growth, implying declining per capita incomes. This revision incorporates projected effects of Brexit, but also other developments since April that lead us to adjust the outlook. Naturally, the direct effects specifically due to Brexit are greatest in Europe, especially the United Kingdom. Our projections for other areas are little changed by Brexit. Despite an uneven distribution across regions of the world, the overall growth downgrade in our baseline global projection is moderate, reflecting among other things a relatively mild assessment of Brexit's negative impact. That scenario, however, is based on country-level information available now, which remains very limited for the post-Brexit period. It is therefore important to underscore that the real effects of Brexit will play out gradually over time, adding elements of economic and political uncertainty that could be resolved only after many months. This overlay of extra uncertainty, in turn, may open the door to an amplified response of financial markets to negative shocks. Thus, while our modestly reduced central scenario is the most likely outcome in our judgment, there are other, downside possibilities with substantially lower growth in Europe and palpable spillovers outside. Because the future effects of Brexit are exceptionally uncertain, the _World Economic Outlook Update _presents two model-based illustrations of alternative scenarios to the baseline'one that is moderately worse, and another that is much worse. These scenarios are driven by the uncertainty Brexit introduces about the U.K.'s ultimate trade relationship with the remainder of the European Union and the wider world; the length and contentiousness of the negotiations; markets' difficulty in gauging the resulting depressing effects on demand; and resulting financial tightening leading to widespread banking- sector stress in the euro area. For the alternative scenarios to develop, the international-trade effects of Brexit would have to be more disruptive than we now anticipate. Moreover, the effects of uncertainty on economic activity would have to be greater than is yet evident to trigger severely negative financial feedback loops. Indeed, a main reason we place less weight on these alternative scenarios, especially the more severe one, is that financial markets have proven resilient in the weeks after the referendum, repricing in an orderly fashion to absorb the news. This benign result owes importantly to the market perception'and the reality'of major central banks' readiness to provide liquidity to markets. But vulnerabilities persist, not least in some of Europe's banks. **Risks to the outlook** Aside from downside possibilities associated with Brexit uncertainty itself, there are other continuing downside risks to the outlook owing to longstanding vulnerabilities and pressure points in the world economy. Many countries, both receiving and originating, face the strains of refugees and other displaced people. These strains have political as well as economic ramifications. Geopolitical risks remain as well, along with political strife in some countries. Crisis legacies on both the real and financial sides of many economies persist'ranging from continuing long-term unemployment, with the associated loss of human capital, to the nonperforming loans that still clog many bank balance sheets. Emerging and low-income commodity exporters struggle with balance of payments pressures, debt overhangs, and low investment. China's welcome transition to a more consumer- and service-oriented growth model still could be bumpy, especially in view of the continuing credit expansion supporting the official growth target. These ongoing risks, joined by the additional risks that the Brexit vote has set in train, are more worrisome because expectations of long-term potential growth have fallen. In part, this fall is the result of demographic and technological trends; but lower potential growth reduces demand today and with it, investment, generating even lower potential output going forward, in a vicious circle. Weak demand today can erode an economy's productive capacity through other channels as well'loss of labor skills, discouraged labor force participation, lower dynamism in the business sector, and slower diffusion of technological best practice. **Policy action is needed** Policymakers should not accept current growth rates as a 'new normal,'\u009d dictated by factors out of the reach of policy. The risks go beyond the pure economic costs of a descent into persistent stagnation. In addition, a slow- growth environment will worsen the social tensions associated with long-term wage stagnation, structural economic change, and threatened entitlement programs. These stresses are contributing to demands for inward-looking solutions that seek to reverse long-term global trends at the expense of the open, dynamic markets that have delivered worldwide growth throughout most of the postwar era. It is up to policymakers (and even more, political leaders) to offer a narrative about these long-term developments to counter those popular ones that blame all ills on globally-oriented markets. But that narrative must also offer the hope of policy actions that can restore middle classes and a sense among voters that the benefits of economic growth can be more fairly shared. With policy space constrained along several dimensions, it is critical to deploy all of the main policy levers efficiently'growth-friendly fiscal policies, well-sequenced structural policies, and monetary policy support for anchored inflation expectations. Efficient policy packages will exploit synergies across various instruments; and policy can be even more effective when it is able to tap synergies across countries as well. More than ever, policymakers should consider the incidence of their measures across different income groups, along with accompanying actions to support social cohesion while promoting economic growth and stability.

For one, it helps mobilize savings and to direct funds into productive uses, for example by providing the start-up capital for the next innovative enterprise. This in turn facilitates a more efficient allocation of resources and increases overall productivity. It also supports the creation of a larger variety of products and services, improves the management of risks, makes payments easier and helps lenders better monitor their clients. In addition, it provides instruments, such as insurance packages, and information that help households and firms to cope with negative events, ensuring more stable consumption and investment. Given the weakening growth outlook for the region, examining all potential sources or lubricants for growth is now of particular interest. So, in our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa_ we examine the extent to which developed, well-functioning and accessible financial institutions and markets could boost growth and what policy options would best help achieve this potential. **Good progress but significant challenges remain** To fully appreciate the potential for further financial development, take a look at the encouraging progress sub-Saharan African countries have made over the last decades. First, the region has led the world in innovative financial services based on mobile telephones, especially in East Africa. The fast spread of systems such as M-Pesa, M-Shwari, and M-Kesho in Kenya has helped reduce transaction costs and facilitate personal transactions even in the absence of traditional financial infrastructure. Microfinance has also grown rapidly, providing services to customers at the lower end of the income distribution, and large parts of the population now have access to financial services more generally (Chart 1). [ But financial inclusion, the degree to which all segments of the population can benefit from financial services, still lags well behind that of other developing regions of the world. For instance, as cellphone ownership continues to grow among the poor, the less well educated, and women, there is a large potential to fully exploit mobile payments to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional methods in providing financial services to the most underserved. Second, the financial sector has deepened'the region's median ratio of private sector credit to GDP has doubled from its 1995 level. However, with the exception of the region's middle-income countries, financial market depth and institutional development are also still much lower than in other regions. Third, we now find Pan-African banks'locally-owned banks that operate in several countries'in the vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries. Their expansion has filled gaps in services left by European and U.S. banks, promoted greater economic integration, and made the sector more competitive. But as often is the case with new and rapidly growing financial developments, Pan-African banks also bring a number of challenges, in particular the need to strengthen supervisory oversight on a consolidated and cross border basis and improve the internal controls and transparency within those institutions. **A large untapped growth potential** But how much more financial development could sub-Saharan African countries realistically achieve? Examining a combined [index of the various dimensions of financial development shows there's a substantial gap between the level of financial development at which many sub-Saharan African countries are currently operating, and what they could reach when compared to other regions with similar structural characteristics. So, the potential for further financial development is substantial, and the impact of filling the gap is about 1\u00c2? percentage points additional annual growth for the median sub-Saharan African country, with variations across country groups (Chart 2). [ In addition, we show that higher financial development can reduce the volatility of growth, especially if financial development is initially relatively low, as is the case for most countries in the region (Chart 3). Here, more financial development relaxes credit constraints and provides instruments to withstand adverse shocks. However, as the sector deepens, its contribution to reducing volatility declines because financial depth also increases the propagation and amplification of shocks. [ **Safeguard macro-stability and strengthen institutions stability** So, what should policymakers do to help sub-Saharan African economies reap this potential? Our analysis shows that the region's financial development has been largely driven by better macroeconomic fundamentals over the last decades, but hindered by weak institutions. So, providing strong legal and institutional frameworks and corporate governance in particular, are critical for creating an environment in which the financial sector can develop and thrive. But countries also need to be vigilant about risks to the financial system and their spillovers to the economy. As regulations in many countries are not fully in line with global best practices, and their implementation remains weak, improving the regulatory framework and strengthening supervisory capacity as well as enforcement powers are essential. Among many other reforms, the harmonization of regulations and supervisory procedures to avoid regulatory arbitrage and establishing an appropriate mechanism for resolving nonviable financial institutions are high priorities. Finally, financial supervisors should monitor carefully the risk related to mobile money transactions as they become increasingly popular in the low- income segment of the population'ensuring households' funds are safe while allowing them to enjoy making transactions more easily, saving for worse times or taking up a loan to start a business.

(Chinese), [Espa\u00c3?ol (Spanish) IMF lending increased to unprecedented levels in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. As difficulties emerged, we extended financial support to countries across the world'in the euro area, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and emerging economies in Europe. The IMF tried to draw lessons in real time as the crisis evolved in order to adapt our operations. We reviewed individual programs and, from time to time, paused and took stock of our experience across countries. The latest such cross-country review was our December 2015 [review of crisis programs. The review looks at the IMF's experience with 32 programs approved during the five or so years after the crisis in 2008. The crisis was difficult and exacted a tremendous toll on countries, which had to deal with consequences amid quickly changing and often unprecedented circumstances. The world economy was extremely fragile and financial markets unsettled. In this environment, policymakers in the euro area had to contend seriously with the possibility that they could have systemic repercussions given the interlinkages between countries and the absence of a firewall and crisis management framework. Two broad conclusions emerged from the review. First, IMF programs played a part in helping the world avoid a fate that many had feared at the outset'a meltdown of the global economic system, a repeat of the Great Depression, a cascading of the crisis from country to country'and, second, the IMF adapted its program design as the crisis unfolded. Here are five of the lessons we learned: **Lesson 1: If the exchange rate is not available as a tool to help the economy adjust to shocks, we may need to prepare for longer programs with more financing.** A notable difference between the crisis program cases and historical program episodes was the very limited adjustment in nominal exchange rates this time. In the chart below, the black dashed line shows the nominal exchange rate path in previous program episodes while the colored lines show the exchange rate path for the various regions in the recent crisis cases. In some cases, the lack of exchange rate movement reflected currency union membership (the euro area); in others it reflected some form of managed exchange rates. In yet others it reflected concerns about the potential impact of a large depreciation on households and corporations that had borrowed heavily in another currency. But regardless of the reason, the main point is that nominal exchange rates did not move much. Instead, the adjustment strategy of many countries relied on so-called 'internal devaluation,'\u009d which seeks to restore external competitiveness by lowering domestic prices instead of the nominal exchange rate. Internal devaluation proved hard to achieve. Some of the overvaluation of real effective exchange rates was corrected, but on average real effective exchange rates adjusted by only 12 percent across program cases, compared with around 48 percent historically. An old truth re-emerged: adjusting the economy smoothly and quickly is much harder to achieve when the nominal exchange rate is not available to help, such as in currency union members. It requires a large macroeconomic (especially fiscal) adjustment and deep-seated, sustained structural reforms'and even then may take longer to achieve than the typical three to four- year period of an IMF program. **Lesson 2: The pace of fiscal adjustment matters, and so does the composition.** Fiscal adjustment is necessary to reduce public debt and restore sustainability. It may need to be rapid if financing is constrained or initial imbalances are very high. It is particularly important in these circumstances to build support for and implement complementary measures to support growth. Otherwise, too large a consolidation done too quickly can, by driving down GDP, actually raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by more than envisaged in the short term. Program design in the context of a regional shock that results in several concurrent programs in neighboring economies also needs to take account of the potential spillovers from fiscal adjustment. Other factors also contributed to push up public debt or pull down output, such as bank recapitalization costs, political uncertainty or crises, confidence shocks, incomplete reform implementation, and weak global demand. Despite fiscal adjustment, debt-GDP ratios rose more than expected in Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina (2009), Greece (2010), Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Maldives, Portugal, and Romania. As the larger-than-expected contractionary effect of fiscal consolidation and other factors on output became evident, we advised countries to slow the pace of consolidation (for example, in Armenia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal, and Ukraine). Our country teams also paid increasing attention to debt restructuring where the debt was so high as to require an implausibly large fiscal adjustment to bring it down within a reasonable time frame. A concern with debt restructuring, particularly if there are no firewalls, is the risk of contagion. Absent this concern, it is better to restructure substantively and early when necessary. Countries that did so tended to achieve better debt and growth outcomes. Fiscal policy paid special attention to social safety nets and poverty. Several countries explicitly aimed to reduce poverty. Many included some form of social protection in their conditionality. And programs were generally effective in protecting social benefit spending. **Lesson 3: Structural reforms** **are important for competitiveness and growth.** This is even more the case when nominal exchange rate adjustment is not available and the strategy is internal devaluation. Structural reforms rightly featured more prominently, therefore, in programs during the crisis period than they had in the previous few years. They were generally implemented well, although implementation was patchier in programs with more numerous reforms or in those that continued for a long time, which might be an indication of 'reform fatigue.'\u009d And reforms did not always pay off as quickly as expected, as the boost to potential growth seems to have been more modest than expected in the short term. This is no reason to shy away from structural reforms; on the contrary, we should support them all the more because the benefits may not be visible right away. But we learned we should be more realistic about how much of a boost to expect from structural reforms in the short run, as well as the authorities' capacity to implement these reforms. **Lesson 4: To reduce risk, countries need early action to enhance debt resolution frameworks as well as bank supervisory and regulatory capacity_. _**Private balance sheets (household, corporate, and financial debt) were an important part of the crisis, and we tried to ensure that programs took them sufficiently into account.** **Countries tried to prevent vicious 'feedback loops'\u009d associated with excessive debt, but they were only partially successful in doing so. The negative effects of bad balance sheets on public finances and growth were bigger than we expected'partly because implementation was patchy, partly because debt resolution/restructuring kept getting delayed, and partly because the crisis kept evolving. At any rate, here too we learned lessons and built them into country programs. **Lesson 5: We would benefit from clearer guidelines for future IMF collaboration with regional financing arrangements.** The experience with the euro area programs brought to the fore the issue of how the Fund interacts with regional financing arrangements and with members of currency unions. Our interaction with regional arrangements was different than before in some key respects, notably the joint approach to program design, which benefited from the arrangements' regional expertise and financing. We could draw lessons from the experience with euro area programs to build more concrete guidelines for future collaboration, recognizing, of course, that institutional frameworks and practices differ across arrangements in different parts of the world. Programs with members of a currency union need to deal with the fact that policies set at the union-wide level may importantly influence the economic situation of an individual member. Such policies are often hard to agree as they can require political agreement among all the members. Where changes in union-wide policy were important, we generally sought them through commitments or surveillance advice. **Test of time** The durability of the gains has still to stand the test of time, but the worst outcomes were largely avoided. The decline in output was cushioned and in many cases reversed, imbalances reduced, and financial systems stabilized. The euro area gained time to mobilize political support to build firewalls and a crisis management framework; emerging economies and small states were able to handle the abrupt decline of global trade and financing flows; and confidence in Middle Eastern and North African economies was shored up after the 2011 Arab Spring. Many articles and books have now been written on the global financial crisis and more are to come. For now, what we need to do from a practical perspective is to ensure program design remains agile and focused on members' needs. Drawing lessons in real time and responding to them is an important part of doing so.

That's not just the stuff of spy movies anymore. Increasingly, a growing number of high-net worth individuals are looking to have a passport portfolio. This has led to a proliferation of so-called citizenship-by-investment or [economic citizenship programs that allow individuals from all over the world to legitimately acquire passports. The wealthy, especially in emerging market economies, see buying citizenship or residency rights as a means of greater global mobility (visa free travel in many countries), tax planning, and family security. In exchange, countries administering such programs receive significant financial inflows into their economies. Indeed, offering citizenship in return for investment has been a 'win-win'\u009d for some small Caribbean states. The substantial inflows of funds from these programs have helped boost employment and growth. Inflows to the public sector alone in St. Kitts and Nevis had grown to nearly 25 percent of GDP as of 2013. Now more and more countries have joined the game. While all well and good, these countries face the critical challenge of preserving the credibility of their citizenship programs and weeding out the risks to governance and sustainability.

This is the main takeaway from the high-level [seminar on 'Law and Financial Stability'\u009d held on May 16-18 in Washington, D.C., organized by the IMF's Legal Department to mark its [70th Anniversary, and which brought together more than 120 senior lawyers and policymakers from over 80 countries. The discussions highlighted the great progress many countries have made in strengthening their legal frameworks in a number of important areas. These include: * **Bank resolution through international standards:** Many resolution authorities now have the mandate and powers needed to resolve a troubled financial institution in an orderly manner. At the international level, national authorities from key jurisdictions have established Crisis Management Groups (CMGs), and have made great progress in implementing resolution planning across borders. * **Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs) and resolution:** After the Pittsburgh summit in September 2009, the G-20 leaders agreed that all standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts should be, where appropriate, cleared through CCPs. Reforms to implement this mandate have advanced, although resolving a CCP involves complex legal and regulatory challenges that deserve further reflection. * **Macroprudential policy:** The global financial crisis has highlighted the costs of systemic instability at both the national and global level, as well as the need for dedicated macro-prudential policies to achieve financial stability. Central banks, in addition to their 'classic'\u009d mandate of defining and implementing monetary policy in order to pursue price stability, are also being given macro-prudential tasks, often accompanied by the microprudential supervision of banks or resolution. Still, national authorities need to put in place effective legal frameworks to support those policies. * **Corporate debt restructuring and economic recovery:** IMF member countries directly or indirectly affected by the global financial crisis have experienced the negative consequences of an overleveraged corporate sector. These countries need to develop comprehensive resolution strategies for non-performing loans, which include both robust insolvency regimes, as well as speedy and cost effective out of court debt restructuring mechanisms. * **Islamic finance: **The activities of institutions providing Shari'ah-compliant banking services have grown rapidly over the years, and are becoming an increasingly important component of the global financial system. Significant progress has been achieved in developing international standards for Islamic banking that complement more general international norms. The role of the Islamic Financial Standards Board (IFSB) and other standard setters in the Islamic banking space has been key. **Further work remains** Despite this progress, participants acknowledged the work that still remains. Many countries still do not yet have effective resolution regimes in place. They also face challenges in in designing effective frameworks for cross- border cooperation that, in particular, will ensure that resolution actions in one jurisdiction can be given effect in the laws of another jurisdiction. As noted above, legal frameworks still need to be strengthened in the areas of CCP resolution, macro-prudential frameworks, and corporate debt restructuring. Further, prevailing international standards enforcing bank resolution as well as anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) may need to be modified to accommodate the specific features of Islamic financial institutions. The international community also confronts new and emerging issues, including: **First, a reduction in correspondent banking relationships. **Several countries have reported a reduction in [correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) by global banks in recent years. Pressure on CBRs has been associated with restricted access to financial services by certain categories of customers, business lines, jurisdictions or regions. The IMF staff has been supporting member countries experiencing issues in this regard by analyzing risks and policy responses in its surveillance and Financial Sector Assessment Program; assessing compliance with international standards including those on AML/CFT; building capacity that can help strengthen regulatory and supervisory frameworks; and facilitating international dialogue, working with other international organizations and stakeholders. ** ****Second, the expansion of the shadow banking system**. This has been one of the key areas of recent attention by policy makers, as it is estimated to account for approximately 25% of total assets of the financial sector. Interaction between banks and shadow banks should be strengthened, and securitization should be made safer. Further work is necessary to decide whether institution-based or activity-based regulation is the right approach to deal with shadow banking. **Third, rising misconduct risks. **At the international level, work continues on reducing misconduct risks. It focuses on exchanging best practices on governance frameworks, developing supervisory toolkits, and examining the effectiveness of post crisis reforms to compensation. It also involves sharing experiences on bank regulators' enforcement powers to address instances of market abuse by professional market parties. However, it is doubtful that this problem can only be addressed through regulation. More fundamental changes involving a shift in the ethical climate within the financial sector may be necessary. **Finally, financial inclusion in emerging economies. **Broadening access into formal financial networks is instrumental not only to empower individuals and families to take advantage of economic opportunities, but also to generate strong and inclusive growth. The growing use of financial technology, supported by robust legal and regulatory frameworks, may play an important role in this respect. **The road ahead** * The international community needs to continue to develop international standards and best practices to guide the design of legislation at the national level and frameworks for cross-border cooperation. * And countries need to continue to put existing international standards and best practices into effect by enacting national legislation, and strengthening countries' institutional capacity to implement them. * The law, however, cannot solve all of the problems arising in the financial sector. A change in culture may also be necessary to improve the ethical standards of financial market participants and public authorities. The IMF remains deeply committed to advancing the legal reform agenda in all areas.

Without cross-border banking services, the flow of money, investment, trade, and foreign payments'all of which grease the wheel of a country's economy'may stop. People abroad face difficulties sending remittances home, international charities can't send donations to help fund local organizations, exporters can't receive payments, and it may [exclude people from their own financial system. If this happens, a country's jobs and growth may be affected. For example, the Pacific island of Samoa is currently in danger of losing the ability to receive formal remittances, which amount to 20 percent of GDP. While the impact on different countries varies, the hardest hit by the withdrawal of global banks are countries in the Caribbean, small island states in the Pacific, and African countries such as Liberia and Angola, to name a few. Some of our economists, financial experts and lawyers decided to shine a spotlight on this critical issue. In a [new paper, they examine what drives this phenomenon and its consequences, and discuss initiatives to address it. **Why they leave: **Global banks may decide to stop doing business with local banks in a particular country for a number of reasons: changes in regulations since the crisis, unclear or overly complex regulations, the cost of doing business in certain countries, particularly if local rules are not up to international standards, economic and trade sanctions, rules to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, and tax transparency. These factors lead banks to evaluate the costs of doing business against the risks, not only to their bottom line but also to their reputation. **What countries can do:** The [right policies can help fix this problem. Both the public and private sector has a role to play and a coordinated approach is needed to better understand the phenomenon and identify specific approaches tailored to each country's circumstances. The IMF can help bring countries together, along with the private sector, to create an open dialogue between policymakers, banks, and other key stakeholders. A 2015 [action plan by the [Financial Stability Board is a guide to priorities. The IMF will also help countries with policy advice and technical assistance so they can update or establish rules designed to keep their financial systems safe and up to international standards. The paper includes some details about how particular countries are affected, an explanation of the factors that lead banks to withdraw, a primer on what the profession calls correspondent banking relationships, which means global banks operating in other countries, and measures taken by different countries to respond to these developments.

Beyond public investment in transport and telecommunications, and more competition in services, dealing with an aging population needs urgent attention. With the right policies, Germany can bring more people into the workforce'and for longer'to counter the demographic trend, argues a recent [study accompanying the regular health check of the German economy by the International Monetary Fund. The problem is widespread across advanced countries: with the baby boomers hitting retirement age and low fertility rates, fewer workers have to sustain a growing proportion of retirees. In Germany, despite a steady inflow of migrants, the number of workers is expected to decline at an accelerating pace after 2020. With less people working, the country's potential output growth'the rate at which the amount of goods and services the country can produce at normal capacity increases'is expected to fall, putting the long-term sustainability of the social security system and public finances at risk (Chart 1). While there is little room to adjust pension benefits or social security contributions, Germany can introduce measures to make it easier for more people to work, and encourage others to work more. According to our analysis, the country would benefit from doing more in the following areas. **Affordable and full-time child care** First, Germany should employ more women and for longer hours. Although a large portion of women is in the labor force (73 percent in 2014), many do not work full-time (the average is 30.5 hours a week, which is 9 hours less than men). While this may reflect to some extent culture and personal preferences, Germany's tax system discourages full-time employment by the household's second earner (usually a woman). The scarcity of affordable, full-time child care options and after-school programs also makes it difficult to reconcile parenting and full-time work. Addressing these constraints would allow more women to switch to full-time employment. More women working more hours would help fill the gaps left by the growing number of pensioners. Our calculations show that if Germany spent a quarter of a percentage point more of its GDP on child care services (lifting the total spending to 0.75 percent of GDP, the OECD average), real GDP would be 2.5 percent higher in the long run, with positive effects on short-term growth as well (Chart 2, first panel). **Retire later** Second, sooner or later, Germany has to take the politically unpopular step of lifting the retirement age further. Currently, Germans stop working at the age of 62.7 on average, which is low in international comparison. The goal should therefore be to extend working lives, by increasing the statutory retirement age (the age at which workers can draw a government pension without penalty) and removing current disincentives to continue working after that age. Adding one extra work year on average would result in 1.75 percent higher real GDP in the long run, according to our calculations (Chart 2, second panel). The corresponding savings for the social security system could be used to lower the already very high contribution rates and/or avoid cuts in benefits, leaving a bit more pay in workers' pockets. **Upgrade immigrants' skills** Third, even before the latest surge in refugees, Germany was attracting a growing number of immigrants. Past experience shows that, as in other countries, immigrants have been integrated in the job market only slowly'with higher unemployment and lower wages than German workers. On average, wage gaps between natives and immigrants have been estimated at 30 percent upon entry, narrowing but not fully disappearing over a span of 25 years. Stepping up investment in training, and adapting training to the needs of immigrants, could help ensure that immigrants have the skills that German employers seek, lifting long-term employment and GDP (Chart 2, third panel). Earlier IMF reports and economic health checks have repeatedly suggested further structural measures that the government should carry out to stimulate growth over the medium-term. These include for example government investment in transport and other public infrastructure, improving crumbling roads and ailing school buildings. In 2015, net public investment in these areas was negative, which means that the country failed to keep up with the depreciation of the public capital. A recently released plan showing sizable increases in transport infrastructure investment is promising, but budget allocations are only to be decided year- by-year and so are highly uncertain. Germany is also lagging many peers when it comes to fast internet broadband connections, and much is left to do to boost competition in some regulated professions and in the postal and railway sectors. _Read also the IMF Survey [interview on the stability of the German financial system._ ", "index": 105}, {"pub": "6/28/2016", "title": "Rising Income Polarization in the United States", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=13404", "content": " By [Ali Alichi Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol (Spanish) The latest IMF [review of the U.S. economy underscores the country's resilience in the face of financial market volatility, a strong dollar, and subdued global demand. But the review also cites longer-term challenges to growth, including rising income polarization. Ever since the 1970s, the number of U.S. middle-income households, as percent of total, has been shrinking. The result has been increasing income polarization. For the three initial decades since then this polarization was more about households moving into the upper income ranks. However, since 2000, more middle-income households have fallen into lower, rather than higher income brackets. Combined with real income stagnation, polarization has had a negative impact on the economy, hampering the main engine of the U.S. growth: consumption. The analysis in our new [paper suggests that over 1998'2013, the U.S. economy has lost the equivalent of more than one year of consumption growth due to increased polarization. **Importance of middle-income households** The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed that 'the most perfect political community is one in which the middle class is in control, and outnumbers both of the other classes.'\u009d More than two thousand years later, most would still agree with that idea. For all its importance, notwithstanding some studies in the 1980s and a handful of recent contributions, economists have fallen behind in documenting the progress being made by middle-income households, their consumption patterns, and other economic behavior. More analysis is needed on the economic policies that could affect middle-income households by spurring the upward mobility of low and middle income earners. Part of the problem has been that we do not have any stable conventions on how best to define middle-income households. Our work seeks to address some of these issues and energize this line of empirical research, focusing specifically on the movement of middle-income households up or down the income ladder, and the economic effects of these moves. While income inequality has attracted much attention, income polarization has yet to receive as much examination. There is a conceptual and qualitative difference between the two: income polarization measures the move from the middle of the income distribution out into the tails; income inequality, however, measures how far apart those tails are, i.e., what is the income distance between the low- and high-income groups. **Worrying trend** Middle-income households serve as a point of reference in any discussion of income polarization, and should, therefore, be well defined. Here, middle- income households are defined as those whose real incomes are within 50 to 150 percent of the median income. Households with incomes below this range are viewed as low income and above it, high income. Chart 1 shows that the population share of middle-income households has shrunk from about 58 percent of total in 1970 to 47 percent in 2014. Such a shift, in part, represents economic progress as roughly half of these households have been able to advance up through the income distribution, while the other half have moved down. Looking at the long trends, however, masks the deteriorating trends since the turn of the current century. While during 1970'2000, more of the middle-income households moved into high- rather than low-income ranks, since 2000 only a quarter of one percent of households have moved up to high income ranks, compared to an astonishing 3\u00c2? percent of households who have moved down the income ladder (from middle to low-income ranks). [ These polarization trends are robust to different cut-offs in defining the middle-income households. In addition, excluding households at the top 1 percent of income distribution or looking at households across age, race, or education still produces the same result. In addition to the polarization trends, it would be also important to look at the income shares of different income groups'a proxy for their relative weights in the economy. Chart 2 shows that income shares have also had a similar trend as polarization trends. The income share of the middle-income households, which was about 47 percent of total income in 1970, had fallen to about 35 percent in 2014. That decrease in the income of the middle-income households corresponds to the increase in the income share of the high-income households. Meanwhile, the income share for the lower-income households has remained flat over the entire period at around 5 percent of total national income. Low wage growth in recent years'partly a result of the drawn out recovery but also because of lower labor market dynamism'has also contributed to these [trends. [ **The macroeconomic consequences of rising polarization** Income polarization, insofar as it disproportionately moves households toward the lower part of the income distribution, may have negative social and political repercussions and simply be seen as unfair. But polarization can also have important macroeconomic consequences. Low- and middle-income households spend a far larger share of their income than high- income households'to use economists' jargon, the low- and middle-income households have higher marginal propensities to consume. Therefore, any loss of income in these two groups has the potential to lower the U.S. economy's aggregate consumption. Given the smaller propensity to consume by higher income groups, they can only provide a partial offset. To make matters worse, evidence suggests that, after controlling for income levels, the responsiveness of consumption to income gains for most of the income distribution has weakened in recent years. This puts further downward pressure on consumption. Combined, these effects are estimated to translate to about 3\u00c2? percentage points of lost U.S. consumption over 1998'2013'equivalent to more than one year of total consumption growth. To sum up: income polarization in the United States has seen a significant increase since the 1970s. While initially more middle-income households moved up the income ladder rather than down, since 2000, most of the increased polarization has been towards the low end of the income ladder. These trends, in addition to the well-documented income inequality trends, have led to a declining income share of the middle-income households. This has important macroeconomic consequences and merits receiving increasing attention and analysis in the coming years. Further research is needed to understand what are the root causes of income polarization and devise policies to mitigate the pattern, ensure the bulk of the population is achieving improved living standards over time, and tackle the social and macroeconomic consequences of polarization toward the lower part of the income distribution.

Surely, it is too soon to understand all the ramifications of the British referendum. But at the same time, today is surely a good day to make the case for multilateralism. While there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about the future, I will argue that globalization still has promise. But to achieve that promise, we will need a fresh look at multilateralism and the role the international financial institutions can play. My generation can be excused for assuming that history moves in one direction: We have experienced globalization and with it rising incomes and economic progress at home and abroad. Our experience was different than our parents' generation, which came of age experiencing depression and war. But now the Brexit vote raises the possibility of an abrupt change in direction. While that vote may have hinged on sentiments about migration and sovereignty, its effect will be the withdrawal of the U.K. from one of the greatest projects of economic integration. European unity has been part of our generation's narrative. From the creation of the coal and steel community in 1951, to the creation of the euro, to the re-integration of central and eastern Europe. Brexit is, at the least, an interruption in that integration process. Could the same doubts that gave rise to Brexit lead to an interruption in globalization? Many people say globalization is unstoppable. Integration has been achieved. There is no going back. I hope so. But Brexit and the economic trends in the world should cause us to pause, and to think again about irreversibility. Despite decades of deepening integration, many have come to question whether closer global integration will bring them meaningful benefits, and they see costs and vulnerabilities, both economic, but also social and cultural. Without clear economic benefits, the costs, including a sense of lack of control, can dominate public opinion. The critics can point to evidence: for people in advanced economies, the global financial crisis was a hit to wealth and, for many, retirement prospects; and growth recovery is still sluggish. People feel the effects of income inequality, stagnating wages, and a lack of job security; and they sense and fear market volatility. At one level, we have to admit that there are some economic forces at play we don't yet fully understand: we cannot satisfactorily answer some important questions. Are we in secular stagnation? Does the trend toward lower real interest rates over the last 15 years reflect a drying up of investment possibilities? We will need to continue looking at these questions. So what can we say? Let me make three points: **First**, globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and raised the living standards across the globe. There is every reason to believe it still holds the promise of supporting rising living standards in advanced economies and emerging markets and developing countries alike. But to preserve and protect that promise, we will have to work to enhance the gains of globalization, limit the costs and vulnerabilities, and make the case to a skeptical public. **Second**, as has always been the case, much of what needs to be done requires action at the individual country level. We at the Fund have called for a three prong approach to boosting growth, with support for demand coming from both fiscal and monetary policies, and with structural reforms tailored to support demand in the short run and to boost potential growth over time. While this remains the right recipe, it is clear that individual governments see limits to their room for maneuver, and so far have not made sufficient progress. And **third**, we need multilateralism now more than ever. Part of the political problem today is that national leaders cannot really solve domestic problems, nor fulfill the aspirations of their people, with domestic action. That is because their country's prospects depend too heavily on global prospects. So, we need everyone pushing in the same direction at the same time. That is why it is important for the IMF to rally its membership to act in harmony. With each country doing its part, the impact will be greater, and leaders can have some greater assurance that growth will be based on demand creation, not demand diversion. And we also need to consider how to make sure that the international monetary system is supportive of individual country efforts, creating growth opportunities and lowering vulnerabilities. When I say this, I have a couple things in mind. Even if the advanced economies are facing a form of secular stagnation, in principle the emerging markets and developing countries hold the potential to be the engine of growth over the next generation, as rapid growth leads to convergence in living standards toward advanced levels. However, we are seeing a perverse slowdown in potential growth in emerging markets and developing countries. With present projections, many large emerging markets cannot expect to see convergence at all. That is perverse because with the availability of technology, Internet communications creating educational opportunities, and ample funds for investment, those countries should be accelerating and speeding convergence in living standards. Now surely, emerging markets and developing countries still have much to do at home to adjust to global events and foster faster growth. But the volatility of the global economy and especially of large flows of short term capital has not been helping. Rather it is leading emerging markets and developing countries to have to act defensively, guarding against openness, worrying about borrowing and current account deficits, and self-insuring with weak currencies and reserve accumulation. Re-examination of the international monetary system can help here. We can re- assess how macro prudential and capital flow measures can provide protection. We can ask how to promote growth supporting equity flows. And how we can better promote technology transfer. And we can create a better global financial safety net, including through IMF coordination with regional financing arrangements, and possibly new IMF lending facilities. There is also room for cooperation with the new multilateral institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, whose formation we welcome. Let me end by observing that the new normal in global economics has a parallel in global politics. Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group has dubbed this a 'G-zero'\u009d, a world characterized by a 'vacuum of global governance'\u009d. Hegemony, for better or worse, no longer prevails. Nor are traditional security relationships coping with the evolution of security challenges. With a growing number of important geo-political risks, and their adverse impacts on economic growth and stability, we will need to pay more attention to the interplay between economics and geopolitics. We see this already in addressing events in the Middle East, Africa, and the refugee issue in Europe. In the economic realm, the IMF can be a voice for global cooperation and collective action. The IMF is stronger than ever, and better able to deal with economic challenges. Now we must continue to address the new challenges that arise with creative, multilateral solutions that can respond to our rapidly changing world. Watch Mr. Lipton's speech [here.

The latest IMF [review of the U.S. economy can be summed up in three numbers: **above 2**, **below 5,** and **4**. What does that mean? * Growth is **above 2 percent: **we expect the economy to grow above 2 percent this year and next, more specifically 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017. * Unemployment is well **below 5 percent: **in the past year an average of 200,000 new jobs were created every month, and household incomes are rising at a healthy clip. * **Four \"forces\" pose a challenge to future growth:** beyond the important recent achievements, however, we need to look forward to what will be needed to ensure strong, sustained and balanced growth in the years ahead. Here, I would highlight in particular the four P's. **The Four P's** What are those four forces? Declining labor force **participation**, falling **productivity** growth, **polarization** in the distribution of income and wealth, and high levels of **poverty** in the U.S. Let me elaborate. _First, labor force **participation** is declining._ * The U.S. population is aging and, as a result, a smaller share of the population will be active in the labor force in the coming years. * The workforce makes up the backbone of the U.S. economy. Mitigating the effects of population aging on labor supply and demand should therefore be a priority'both here in the U.S. but also in many of the advanced economies. _Second, **productivity** growth has also declined._ * It has fallen from 1.7 percent in the decade prior to 2007 to 0.4 percent in the past five years. * Much of the gains in average per capita incomes in the 20 years before the financial crisis were from gains in productivity, innovation, and efficiency. * The fall in productivity growth seems, at least in part, to be linked to falling dynamism both in the U.S. labor markets and in the formation of new and productive enterprises. _Third, the distribution of income and wealth has steadily become more and more **polarized**. This is a double-edged sword._ * On the one hand, since 2000 around one quarter of a percent of the population has moved from earning close to the median income to earning 1.5 or more times the median. This is a good thing and has raised living standards for those families. * On the other hand, though, more than 3 percent of the population has moved into the group that earns less than half of the median income. For that group, economic insecurity and flat real incomes have resulted in either a stagnation or decline in living standards. * Our [calculations suggest that since 1999, this polarization of the income distribution has knocked around 3\u00c2? percent off of badly needed consumer demand. That is around one year's consumption over a period of 15 years. _Fourth, the share of the population living in **poverty** is at very high levels._ * The latest official poverty [measure shows almost 15 percent of Americans'or 46.7 million people'living in poverty. Measured by the supplemental poverty measure, which takes into account effects of government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Earned Income Tax Credit_,_ the poverty rate is even higher. * Regardless of which measure you use, poverty is even higher than the average for certain minority groups; for single parent (and particularly female-headed) households; for children; and for those with disabilities. * With such a large share of the population living below the poverty line, this undoubtedly is an important macroeconomic issue. * Not only does poverty create significant social strains, it also eats into labor force participation, and undermines the ability to invest in education and improve health outcomes. By holding back economic and social mobility, it creates an inter-generational persistence of poverty. All in all, our assessment is that, if left unchecked, these four forces'participation, productivity, polarization, and poverty'will corrode the underpinnings of growth (both potential and actual) and hold back gains in U.S. living standards. **What are the policies needed to counter these 'forces'\u009d?** We have outlined a range of possible options. Let me highlight a few: * Policies need to help lower income households'including through a higher federal minimum wage, more generous earned income tax credit, and upgraded social programs for the nonworking poor. * There is a need to deepen and improve the provision of reasonable benefits to households to give incentives for work, raise the labor supply, and to support families. This should include paid family leave to care for a child or a parent, childcare assistance, and a better disability insurance program. I would just note that the U.S. is the only country among advanced economies without paid maternity leave at the national level and U.S. female labor force participation is 12 percent lower than that for men. Sensible skills-based immigration reform could also raise the labor supply and boost productivity. * Boosting productivity growth is another policy imperative. Productivity gains must inherently be based in the private sector. But public policies can help. A better tax system, efforts toward more trade integration, better infrastructure, a stronger and more vocationally oriented education system would all support higher productivity growth. None of this is easy. However, there are many good ideas out there as to how best to address these issues. And that provides a strong foundation for progress. In conclusion, let me return to my 'above 2, below 5, and 4'\u009d: We think that growth should be 2.2 percent this year and higher still in 2017; unemployment is below 5 percent; and by countering the 'four forces,'\u009d I am confident that the United States can remain on the frontier of innovation and opportunity.

[New research indicates that easing barriers to international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) could boost productivity and output. Efforts to lower trade barriers have been stalling, but a push toward new agreements promises to reverse the trend. The recent Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement between the United States, Japan, and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, along with the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Europe on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), place productivity and growth high on policymakers' agendas. Past multilateral trade liberalization rounds have helped boost productivity, so these recent agreements'albeit not global'could do the same, given their broad geographic coverage, both as a percentage of total world GDP and total world trade. Policymakers, however, need to be mindful of the distributional effects of open trade and take steps to mitigate the impact on those displaced to realize the full potential of lower trade barriers on productivity and economic well-being. As shown below in Chart 1, even in advanced economies, which have already liberalized tariffs in the past, further reductions in nontariff/regulatory barriers to trade and FDI offer scope for additional productivity gains. [ **How liberalization of trade and FDI lifts productivity and output ** There is wide consensus that liberalization of trade and FDI can lead to improved resource allocation across firms and sectors, boosting productivity and output. For instance, existing evidence suggests that more-productive firms tend to gain market share at the expense of less-productive firms. But two specific effects of liberalization additionally enhance productivity: * **Increased competition:** Lower trade and FDI barriers on final goods can strengthen competition in the liberalized sector(s). This can help firms exploit economies of scale, improve efficiency, absorb foreign technology, and innovate. * **Enhanced variety and quality of available inputs:** Trade liberalization can also boost productivity by increasing the quality and variety of intermediate inputs used in final goods production. ** **So which of these two effects is more important? New research, based on our unique database of effective tariffs in 18 sectors across 18 advanced countries spanning more than two decades, sheds light on this issue. We find that productivity gains arising from tariff cuts on intermediate inputs outweigh the gains arising from cutting 'output tariffs,'\u009d which capture competitive pressures from liberalization in the sector considered. In other words, trade liberalization in upstream industries that use intermediate inputs matters more for sector-level productivity than liberalization in the sector itself. Specifically, a one per cent reduction in input tariffs raises total factor productivity levels by about two percent. The productivity gains from liberalization appear to materialize rather quickly, within 1-5 years, with the estimated impact leveling off over time. **Size of productivity gains** ** **For advanced economies, tariff reductions have clearly been important drivers of productivity growth in the past. For the countries in our sample, input tariffs fell on average by 0.5 percentage point over the decade 1997-2007, which translates into an average productivity gain of about 1 percent. While trade barriers in advanced countries have been reduced substantially over the last two decades, further reduction would lead to additional productivity gains in some sectors in some countries. A simple back-of-the- envelope calculation of the potential gains from total elimination of remaining tariffs indicates that aggregate productivity could rise by around 1 percent, on average, across advanced economies. This varies from a 0.2 percent gain in Japan to a 5 percent gain in Korea. Potential gains for Ireland and Korea are estimated to be larger than for other advanced economies: Korea has higher remaining effective tariffs than other advanced countries in the sample; Ireland's strong reliance on imported inputs, especially in specific sectors, such as chemical and pharmaceutical industries, would drive the potential gains. The analysis of productivity gains that would follow from tariff liberalization is only an illustration of how trade liberalization more broadly could bring about even larger gains in productivity. Indeed, our estimated productivity gains from tariff liberalization should be viewed as lower bounds because they do not account for the gains that would arise from reallocation of resources across industries, that is, from more efficiently capitalizing on each country's comparative advantage or, most importantly, from a reduction of non-tariff barriers. [ **Why complementary policies are important** The productivity dividend from the liberalization of tariffs depends importantly on complementarities between FDI and trade. In particular, our research suggests that the productivity gains arising from a reduction in both 'output'\u009d (final goods) tariffs and input tariffs tend to be higher in those countries that have less restrictive FDI regimes. One reason for this result could be that foreign firms use imported inputs more effectively and pay a lower fixed cost for importing: their presence, which benefits from lower barriers to FDI, thus magnifies the productivity impact of tariff liberalization through the input channel. These results are economically significant. For instance, when the FDI restrictiveness index is at the 75th percentile of its cross-country and cross-sector distribution, the impact of a 1 percentage point drop in input tariffs on total factor productivity ranges from zero to -1 percent, while it ranges from 3 percent to 4 percent when FDI restrictiveness is at the 25th percentile of its distribution. **Policy takeaways** Our findings provide a case for further liberalization to raise productivity and output in advanced economies. That the estimates vastly understate potential gains by overlooking the much larger economic benefits of easing non-tariff barriers makes the case all the stronger. Indeed, recent trade liberalization efforts have increasingly centered on reducing non-tariff barriers, particularly in services sectors, and from expediting customs procedures. Given the emerging and low-income countries' comparatively higher barriers to trade, productivity gains for them could conceivably be even higher. Reducing barriers to FDI in parallel would amplify the positive impact of lower tariffs and reduced non-tariff barriers on productivity. The productivity gains from trade liberalization may also benefit from reforms in other areas, such as in labor or product markets. For instance, the effect of tariff liberalization could be greater when domestic product-market ('behind- the-border barriers'\u009d) regulations are less stringent. This highlights the need for a broad liberalization agenda cutting across different areas. **Compensating policies for those affected** Trade and FDI liberalization can have costs. While this kind of reallocation of resources between firms and industries is a source of productivity growth, workers in specific locations, industries, or with skill mismatches could face serious costs including wage cuts and job losses. Increased mobility of capital from FDI liberalization could also lower the bargaining power of less mobile workers. This highlights the importance of supportive labor market policies (e.g., education and training) and other interventions to compensate those that are displaced and achieve a more equitable adjustment. Including labor standards or other labor provisions, as is done increasingly in trade agreements, could help to distribute the benefits more widely.

(Arabic) The significant and prolonged drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has changed the fortunes of many energy-exporting nations around the world. This applies particularly to countries of the Middle East and Central Asia, because these regions are home to 11 of the world's top 20 energy exporters. Budgets have generally turned from surpluses to large deficits (Chart 1), growth has slowed, and financial stability risks have increased. In such a challenging environment, a policy of \"business as usual\" will not suffice'policymakers will need to adopt [significant measures to put public budgets on a sounder footing, address risks to liquidity and the quality of assets in the financial sector, and improve growth prospects. This will be a difficult long-term process, but the good news is that many countries have made a strong start, especially in terms of budget policies. [ **Spending restraint** In the early stages of the oil price decline, most countries appropriately used their savings to cope with the shortfall in oil revenues. As it became clear that the oil price decline would persist, oil exporters made significant spending cuts, an obvious area to target since public expenditures had ballooned during the oil-price boom. The budget plans for 2016 indicate that deficit-reduction efforts will deepen further, with sizable adjustment measures planned especially in Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Countries have generally aimed for savings in both current and investment expenditures. Cross-country evidence suggests that reviewing both spending categories is sensible'for instance, the Gulf countries, Algeria, and Central Asian oil exporters all have higher capital expenditure levels than their emerging market counterparts (Chart 2). The Gulf countries and Algeria, meanwhile, also have a much larger public sector payroll, a longstanding element of the social contract between policymakers and their citizens. [ Artificially low domestic energy prices are also being targeted by policymakers. Government regulations ensuring inexpensive fuel, water, and electricity have traditionally been another part of the social contract. Therefore, the reform of these subsidies (that had tended to benefit the well- off) is welcome evidence of a sea change in the policies of the oil exporters. Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and, more recently, Qatar have gone one step further by introducing automatic pricing, whereby local energy prices adjust in tandem with international benchmarks. The challenge for policymakers across the region will be to move energy prices toward international levels in a way that minimizes the adverse social impact; for example, through targeted transfers to the vulnerable segments of population. **New sources of revenues** Spending control is only part of the fiscal equation for oil exporters, however. Another important consideration is finding new sources of revenue. A number of promising plans are emerging, especially the discussions of Gulf countries to introduce a value-added tax (VAT). This would be a major achievement for a region that has traditionally relied mostly on hydrocarbon- linked receipts. In parallel, some Gulf countries have been raising fees, excises, and corporate income taxes. In the Central Asian oil exporters, non- oil taxation is much more developed, but there is room to reduce exemptions and strengthen collections (Chart 3). [ Central Asian oil exporters have achieved some fiscal adjustment indirectly, by allowing their exchange rates to depreciate. This has raised the local- currency value of their export receipts and related taxes. However, these fiscal gains will only last if fiscal expenditures, in particular public wages, do not increase in tandem with the exchange rate depreciation. Currency adjustment in these economies has also brought some undesired side effects, including inflationary pressures and concerns about stability of the highly-dollarized financial systems. Therefore, the Central Asian oil exporters also face the challenge of strengthening their monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policy frameworks. **Push for diversification** In the coming years, oil revenues will no longer be sufficient for governments to act as the main employer of their fast-growing young populations. Therefore, policymakers must find new ways to promote private sector development and help their economies diversify away from oil. The Gulf countries already benefit from high-quality infrastructure, but are hindered by bureaucracy and lingering gaps in their legal and regulatory frameworks. They could also further improve the quality of education.

The term graced the cover of _TIME_ magazine in December 2012, in an issue that chronicled the region's decades-long journey from economic anemia to impressive vigor. Beginning in the mid-1990s, many'but certainly not all'countries in sub-Saharan Africa energized their economies, achieving in recent years some of the world's highest growth. Living standards improved as a result, as did health care and other key services, inspiring hope for a bright future. The past year has been harsh, however, as the region suffered a sharp slowdown, owing to slumping commodity prices and softer global economic conditions. Drought has struck in some countries. And China'now a major trade and business partner in a number of African countries'is slowing as it retools its economy, sparking fears of further weakening. A wave of pessimism is taking hold, prompting some to wonder if the Africa Rising story has come to an end. This issue of _F&amp;D_ looks at this critical moment for Africa and brings together articles suggesting that many countries are well positioned to ride out this storm despite the toughest conditions in a decade. Our writers express hope that strong growth will resume, albeit with a pause or two along the way In his overview, Georgetown University's Steven Radelet documents [changes that leave Africa better positioned to handle this downturn. Marked improvements in governance, the emergence of more adroit leaders and economic managers, and better economic and social policies are a solid foundation for future growth. Although likely to slow in the next few years, he says, the long-term outlook for growth is solid for countries that diversify their economies, increase competitiveness, and further strengthen their institutions of governance. Antoinette Sayeh, head of the IMF's African Department, sounds a similar note in her [Straight Talk column, arguing that the underlying drivers of growth over the past decade still persist and that a reset of monetary and fiscal policies can help reignite sustainable growth in the region.

Total debt of nonfinancial firms in Latin America increased from US$170 billion in 2010 to US$383 billion in 2015. With potential growth across countries in the region slowing, in line with the end of the commodity supercycle, it will now be more difficult for firms to operate under increased debt burdens and reduced safety margins. In this environment, Latin American firms are walking a tightrope. With external financial conditions tightening, the walk towards the other side'notably through adjustment and deleveraging'while necessary, has become riskier. After making good progress, the crossing has also become more perilous due to strong headwinds'including slower global demand and bouts of heightened market volatility. In our most recent [regional report, and in a companion [working paper, we take a deeper look at the factors driving corporate risk in Latin America over the last decade. We use company-specific financial information for close to 500 publicly listed nonfinancial firms between 2005'15 in 7 major economies'Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Peru. We then gauge the main factors driving corporate risk dynamics in the region. We analyze company-specific, country-specific, and global conditions and the factors contributing the most to the recent rise in corporate risk. **Warning signs** The data shows that corporate risk, as reflected in higher credit default swaps (CDS) spreads, has indeed been rising in 2014'15 (Figure 1), though only in the cases of Argentina and Brazil has it approached the levels observed during the global financial crisis. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the peak year in most commodity prices (2011) marks the beginning of risk differences across countries, which have further widened since late 2014. Our results show the following: * All dimensions'company-specific, country-specific, and global factors'play a role in driving corporate risk, albeit to varying degrees and with different implications across countries. Overall, macroeconomic domestic factors, particularly the pace of currency depreciation and changes in sovereign spreads, are key direct factors placing upward pressure on corporate risk since 2011 (Figure 2). * External conditions'in particular measures of global risk aversion (such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, VIX)'constitute a dominant driver of corporate risk. Stress tests indicate that external shocks can generate substantial increases in corporate risk across the region'ranging from 100 to almost 300 basis points in the event that the VIX surges to just half of the spike observed during the global financial crisis. * Domestic macroeconomic and political factors have played a particularly important role in generating upward pressures on corporate risk in Argentina and Brazil through rapid exchange rate depreciation and an increase in sovereign CDS spreads'reflecting significant macroeconomic imbalances (Figure 3). Higher corporate vulnerabilities in Colombia have been driven by the large exchange rate depreciation, as well as deteriorating firm-specific factors. The latter has also generated upward pressure on corporate spreads in Peru. In contrast, Chile, Mexico, and Panama have experienced much lower pressures on corporate risk from domestic economic factors. * Across these major Latin American economies, benign global financial conditions (in particular, low market volatility) have helped to contain corporate risk despite an environment of slower external demand and declining commodity prices. **Minimizing risk** The soundness of policy frameworks matters for corporate risk. Indeed, given the important link between corporate and sovereign spreads, macroeconomic stability and credible policies are an important defense against additional upward pressures on corporate spreads. For instance, reining in risks to fiscal sustainability as well as curbing inflation, particularly in Argentina and Brazil, is crucial to contain corporate risk. Recognizing the importance of global factors in driving corporate risk at home, solid macroeconomic policies alone, however, may not be enough and supporting underlying microeconomic adjustments are also imperative. This means promoting firms' capacity to push through needed adjustments. In particular, orderly deleveraging through market-based solutions should be the first line of defense in highly indebted companies. Public sector equity should not be used to stave off needed adjustments in the corporate sector. In the case of insolvent companies, restructuring and bankruptcy legislation should minimize both administrative costs and economic losses related to default. Finally, enhanced monitoring and supervision and well-targeted macroprudential policies are key to alleviate risks and spillovers, particularly to the financial system. Policymakers should monitor closely corporate balance sheets and income flows, particularly in systemically important nonfinancial firms. Financial regulators also have a critical role to play. Adequate consolidated supervision, particularly in cases where financial and nonfinancial firms are highly interlinked, remains an important risk-mitigating tool.

Until about 1990, Asia grew rapidly and secured large gains in poverty reduction while simultaneously achieving a fairly equitable society. Since the early 1990s, however, the region has witnessed widening income inequality that has accompanied its robust expansion'a break from its own remarkable past. This matters because elevated levels of inequality are harmful for the pace and sustainability of growth. What can be done? Our research finds that policies could substantially reverse the trend of rising inequality. In particular, given limited social safety nets, well-designed fiscal policies may be able to alleviate inequality without stifling the region's wealth- creating growth. Home to more than half of the world's population, Asia remains the engine of global growth. It is expected to grow at 5.5 percent in 2016 and account for almost two thirds of global expansion this year and next. After more than two decades of rapid economic development, incomes rose across all segments of Asia's population. Though millions have been lifted out of poverty thanks to the growth dividend alone, the IMF's _[Regional Economic Outlook for the Asia and Pacific_ shows that economic development has not benefited the region's populations equally or at the same pace, causing the region's income disparity to grow. **Rising inequality** Indeed, income inequality has risen in most of Asia, in contrast to most regions. In some larger countries, including China and India, spatial disparities, in particular between rural and urban areas, explain much of the increase. Since 1990, China's economy has recorded the steepest growth but also a large increase in income inequality. In India, the gap between the income share of top and bottom earners also grew significantly (Figure 1). While global factors, such as technological change that puts a premium on skills, help explain inequality anywhere in the world, regional and country- specific factors influence the growing discrepancies between income levels of different populations in Asia. Asia seems to be unique not just in its pattern of high and sustained economic growth, but also in the distinctive effect of various policy-related inequality drivers. For example, financial deepening, which tends to be associated with higher inequality in other parts of the world, has had an equalizing effect in Asia. In a number of Asian economies, government policies have successfully sought to expand the coverage of financial services, giving low-income households and small and medium-sized enterprises access to credit. **Contributing Factors ** On the other hand, in contrast to other regions, where education and social benefits function as economic equalizers, they have failed to reduce income inequality in Asia and even tend to increase it. Progressive taxation predictably ameliorates income inequality in Asia, just as it does in other parts of world. However, poorly targeted policies are partly to blame for failure of expenditure to alleviate income inequality. Moreover, social safety net spending is relatively low in Asia compared with the rest of the world (Figure 2), and lower revenue collection translates into lower coverage of spending, including, for example, on social insurance. Let's put it in a more global, comparative context. At 22 percent, the share of retirees in Asia who receive a pension is among the lowest in the world ' about the same as in Sub-Saharan Africa and approximately one-fourth the level in advanced economies or in Emerging Europe (Figure 3). Unemployment benefits are similarly low, and like all other social benefits, distributed unequally. The spotty reach of social-benefits spending, combined with poorly targeted spending that disproportionately benefits the more affluent, puts a strain on the countries' budgets without meeting the equalizing social purpose of these fiscal policies. Furthermore, Asia also faces considerable inequality of opportunity (as do other regions), which is of critical importance since it delinks economic outcomes from an individual's efforts and thus entrenches income disparities that prevent the emergence of a substantial middle class. Lack of access to education and health services can worsen education and health outcomes, hampering productivity and perpetuating income inequality. Also, the inadequate financial services also constrains the ability of people, particularly low-income individuals, to borrow for investment and to finance education spending. **Policy Responses ** So what can be done to reverse this trend of rising inequality in Asia? Strengthening the redistributional effect of fiscal policy could help without endangering the region's poverty-reducing growth. On the tax side, broadening the base for income and consumption taxes while making them more progressive is important, but it cannot be achieved without better compliance to support effective tax collection. On the spending side, designing well-targeted transfer programs while avoiding costly universal price-subsidy schemes is essential, as is improving and broadening access to health services and higher education to raise earnings potential and reduce income gaps.

(Arabic) Every year, millions of people leave their countries of birth in search of better opportunities abroad. Often, these migrants are among the most talented workers in their home countries. At first glance, this is a loss for the home countries, which invested considerable time and money in educating and developing these people, only to watch them leave. But look again. With the right policies, home countries can make use of their diaspora communities'which include emigrants and their descendants'to support the economy. In a recent [study, my colleagues and I find that diasporas can help raise long-term economic growth, on average, by 0.6 percentage points in emerging and developing home countries (see chart). [ **How diaspora communities boost home-country growth ** Diaspora communities can make a unique contribution to the development of their home countries'especially toward building physical capital and productivity, and ultimately helping to boost job creation, living standards, and higher growth. How do they do this? First, they send money home in the form of remittances. Migrants from emerging and developing countries sent home $430 billion last year'three times more money than their home countries receive in financial assistance from other countries or international financial institutions and a substantial portion of their GDP. For example, as a percent of GDP, remittances represent 37 percent in Tajikistan, 30 percent in Nepal, around 25 percent in Tonga, Liberia, and Haiti, and 16 percent in Lebanon. These figures could be even higher if the high cost of sending remittances'ranging from 5 percent of the amount being sent in South Asia to 12 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa'were lowered. When these remittances are spent on goods and services, they immediately support economic activity. When these remittances are used to invest, they can boost the home-country's capital. For example, relatives back home may use this money to fund their own businesses'or they may save it, increasing the funds banks have to lend to businesses. Diasporas also invest directly in business opportunities and government bonds in their home countries. In addition to supporting investment in capital, diasporas also support productivity by funding education, training, and healthcare. Second, by virtue of their education and training, diaspora networks convey knowledge and expertise'raising productivity through a variety of channels. By contributing to the design of educational curriculum and training, diasporas can raise the quality of education in their home countries. They can also directly provide rigorous professional development and leadership training programs. Combining their skills, contacts, and know-how with their insights into global opportunities and local customs, diasporas help home-country businesses overcome hurdles, raise efficiency, and expand into new markets. In the same vein, they can also be powerful advisors to governments in helping to improve the quality of public institutions and advocates to foreign businesses looking to expand. For example, Indian-born executives in U.S.-based technology companies played a critical role in giving their companies the confidence to outsource work to India. **Catalyzing diasporas** Ultimately, the intensity of diaspora involvement in their home country depends on a multitude of factors. Many of those are out of policymakers' realm of influence, such as culture, a sense of identity, prevalence of extended families, and security conditions. However, there is also plenty governments can do. A multi-pronged strategy can help governments get the most out of their large and successful diaspora communities, including: * **_Developing networks_** are essential for deepening communication and building partnerships of diasporas with professional communities at home and across the diasporas themselves. Governments can support these networks in two key ways. As a first step, they can reach out to highly educated and motivated parts of their diasporas to encourage participation in the network. Governments can also provide forums for information sharing, ranging from simple websites to large-scale conferences. [Globalscot, a diaspora network created and managed by the Scottish government, is just one example. Making use of various platforms, they have elevated the quantity and quality of global knowledge circulation in Scotland. * **_Encouraging investment _**by relaxing legal barriers and capital flow restrictions faced by diasporas when investing in home-country property and business opportunities. Governments can also appeal to the patriotism of their diasporas by encouraging them to support public investment by marketing bonds catered to their interests. Infrastructure bonds sold by Israel are an example. More broadly, improvements to the business environment, governance, the quality of institutions, and reducing perceptions of corruption would facilitate investment from not only diaspora networks, but also from other entities abroad as well. * **_Reducing remittance costs_** and improving access to wider financial services for migrants and remittance recipients would raise regular remittance flows. This can be achieved by enhancing the integrity of money transfer systems, improving the infrastructure for domestic and cross-border payments, removing legal barriers to the development of sound remittance markets, and fostering market competition. Recently, Indonesia, Liberia, Nicaragua, and Samoa implemented policy reforms, technical improvements, and regulatory changes aimed at enhancing the remittance market for consumers. * A **_strong communications strategy_** on the benefits of diaspora networks is helpful in mobilizing support from elites in home countries. This is important because elites, who may view diasporas as competition, often have a strong influence on home-country institutions that partner with diasporas.

(Chinese) China's economy leaves nobody indifferent. The world is watching closely as the second largest economy in the world is shifting its growth model from an export-driven one to one centered on household consumption. As China's economy slows and rebalances, its impact is being felt on an already fragile global economy, and particularly in the rest of the Asia region. Our recent [studies show that while China's rebalancing will adversely affect some Asian economies, it will also open opportunities for several others. **A significant partner** Because of its sheer size and integration into the global economy, China's transition will certainly affect those around it. China is now the top trading partner of most major economies in the region, particularly in East Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During 2000'15, exports to China increased dramatically from 3 percent to 9 percent of world exports and from 9 percent to 22 percent of Asian exports. According to IMF staff calculations, a 1 percentage point change in China's real GDP growth is estimated to affect the real GDP growth of the median Asian economy by 0.15'0.30 of a percentage point. Against this backdrop, some countries have felt the pinch. As China's economy moves away from investment, its demand for raw materials used intensively in related activities, such as iron ore, copper, and coal, is declining contributing to lower commodity prices. Commodity exporters such as Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and New Zealand are likely to be hard hit. Beyond that, those economies that have been closely integrated with China through the global value chains, and which are heavily exposed to China's investment activity, such as Korea and Taiwan Province of China, will be affected. Suppliers of technology like Japan and Korea, and providers of capital, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, will also feel the pain. Finally, financial connections are also growing. Financial spillovers from China to regional markets are on the rise, in particular in equity and foreign exchange markets, driven by greater trade links with China (see Chart 1). In addition, several economies, such as Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China, have significant financial links with China, both directly and through Hong Kong. Overall, financial markets are likely to become more sensitive to shocks from China as these links develop further, including with the ongoing internationalization of the renminbi and China's gradual capital account liberalization. [ **New opportunities for some countries** Still, China's rebalancing also presents opportunities for several economies in the region. Countries that export consumer goods to China, such as New Zealand (higher end food), or that are destinations for rapidly-growing Chinese tourism, could benefit (see Chart 2). China's efforts to move to higher value-added production will also provide opportunities for low-income Asian countries, particularly in labor-intensive manufacturing sectors, such as apparel, footwear, furniture, and plastic toys. Already, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Vietnam have captured some of the global market share in these sectors. [ **Adapting to change** As China moves to become a service economy, the region will need to adapt. Here are three things countries could do: * Countries need to diversify their economies and look for new engines of growth, including through deeper trade (and financial) integration. Promoting the growth of the services sector can help, both as a response to China's rebalancing and as a new source of growth while the region reduces its reliance on manufacturing and exports. Structural reforms, aided by growth-friendly fiscal policy, should support economic transitions, while boosting potential growth and alleviating poverty. * With inflation low across most of the region, monetary policy should remain supportive of growth. At the same time, exchange-rate flexibility should be part of the risk-management toolkit. Flexible exchange rates have provided and will continue to provide an effective cushion, barring a trade-off with external stability. Countries with adequate fiscal space can use fiscal policy to help smooth the adjustment. * Countries need to safeguard financial stability, especially if volatile asset prices and exchange rate movements increase vulnerabilities, including in the corporate sector. Measures could also include capital flow management to guard against sudden and large-scale cross-border capital flows associated with large external shocks. Over time, though, as economic rebalancing makes China's growth model more resilient and sustainable, its Asian neighbors will benefit. But in the meantime, some of them should expect to feel the effects of China's rebalancing and be prepared to brace for change.

In theory, a falling currency is expected to create inflation by driving up the price of imported goods and services'triggering what economists call exchange rate pass-through. Indeed, prices are on the rise in Latin America while they stagnate in the rest of the world. Inflation has remained stubbornly above central bank targets in some Latin American countries and two of the region's largest economies'Venezuela and Argentina'have the highest inflation rates in the world (Chart 1). Recalling the instability that followed large depreciations in the region during the 1980s and 1990s, should we be worried about the impact of the current depreciations on inflation? Yes and no. Where monetary frameworks have improved substantially over the past two decades, the rate at which currency depreciations are passed through to domestic prices is much lower than in the past. But in other Latin American countries, exchange rate pass-through remains larger than warranted. [ **Revisiting exchange rate pass-through in Latin America** Our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Western Hemisphere_ revisits the question of exchange rate pass-through in Latin America. In joint work with Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Magud and Fabi\u00c3\u00a1n Valencia, we first estimate how consumer prices have been affected by nominal exchange rate depreciations in a large group of countries since the late 1990s. We then compare these pass-through estimates with the import content of domestic consumption, since the price of goods purchased abroad is expected to respond closely to movements in the exchange rate for reasons largely outside the control of the local central bank. This provides us with a benchmark to assess exchange rate pass-through, beyond which we might suspect that second-round factors'such as indexation through wage and pricing contracts, or self-fulfilling price hikes due to expectations'are at work in driving inflation. Our findings suggest that pass-through in emerging economies has fallen dramatically over time, including by four-fifths among Latin America's most established inflation targeters (Chart 2). In these cases, the degree of pass- through has fallen to below 10 percent and is now smaller than the share of imports in the domestic consumption basket'a characteristic that was once limited to advanced economies such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This comparison suggests that second-round inflationary effects are no longer playing a major role in these countries. [ According to our analysis, this strong performance is related to improvements in the credibility of central banks since the late 1990s. Stronger and more independent central banks in the region have been able to better anchor inflation expectations, thus preventing increases in the price of non-tradable goods following depreciations. This largely explains why the inflationary impacts of the recent episodes have been so modest despite the extent of currency depreciations in countries with well-established inflation targeting regimes, such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. But there is substantial variation in pass-through estimates among Latin American countries, and our estimates suggest that second-round effects remain important in the region (Chart 3). While our analysis cannot fully capture the effects of very recent improvements in policy frameworks, it suggests that many countries still have ground to cover in terms of improving central bank credibility. Over time, as countries establish a strong track record of meeting their inflation targets, exchange rate pass-through will likely decline further in the region. [ **Will the anchors hold? ** Despite lower pass-through, the size and persistence of recent depreciations have generated enough effects to push inflation outside central bank target bands in many countries in the region. Where currencies have depreciated repeatedly in response to a sequence of external shocks, central banks have had to deal with the tension of keeping monetary policy expansionary to support weak domestic demand despite inflation remaining outside their target range for a prolonged period. This, of course, creates a difficult environment for the communication of monetary policy in an inflation targeting framework. In particular, there might be a risk that markets begin to second-guess central bank targets, causing inflation expectations to rise. Hence, monetary accommodation can only take place if markets believe in the central bank's commitment to meeting inflation targets in the medium term. Otherwise, hard- won gains in credibility that were accumulated over a long period could be lost rapidly. That is why our advice rests on two equally important pillars. First, if central banks clearly communicate the drivers that are pushing inflation above target and the reasons behind their interest rate decisions, monetary policy can remain accommodative so long as inflation expectations are well anchored. Second, if medium-term inflation expectations begin to deviate from their target, central banks should be ready to take proactive policy measures. Indeed, most regional central banks have responded to increasing expectations by hiking rates modestly, underscoring their intention to do what is necessary to fulfill their mandates. So far, anchors have held firm, and most Latin American inflation targeters have ridden out some very large swells of external adjustment with relative success, having supported their economies with accommodative policy while rightly tolerating a temporary period of higher inflation that was outside their control. Steady reductions in exchange rate pass-through over the past two decades have helped make this possible.

This has created unique opportunities for continued growth. By contrast, when it comes to exports of manufactured goods, India has lagged behind its emerging-markets peers, both in quality and as a percentage of the total export basket, leaving substantial room for improvement. While trade leads to structural transformation and diversification of economies, the types of goods and services traded'and trading partners'make all the difference. India should capitalize further on its comparative advantage in exports of high-value services. At the same time, it should also increase the quality, sophistication, and diversification of manufacturing. That way, India can expand its total exports, while improving the sophistication of goods and services, and diversifying into higher value-added activities that generate better jobs for Indians. Our new [paper looks at the evolution and prospects of India's exports documents and analyzes the technological content, quality, sophistication, and complexity of India's export basket. It also discusses their implications for future export performance, structural transformation, and growth. **India's exports evolution** The evolution of Indian exports follows a unique growth model: a well- integrated, technologically advanced, and highly sophisticated service sector thrives alongside a lagging manufacturing sector. At 32 percent, the share of services in total exports is now more than double the average for emerging markets (EMs) and exceeds that of many advanced-income economies. At the same time, the share of goods exports in total exports declined from nearly 80 percent in 1990 to 67 percent in 2013. India owes its rapid growth in service exports to the emergence of _modern services_, defined as products that can be stored and traded digitally. The fastest-growing sector of the global economy, exports of modern services account for nearly 70 percent of India's total commercial-services exports, double the average for emerging markets (see Chart 1). Though no developing economy performed as spectacularly as China between 1980 and 2013, most have seen sharp increases in manufacturing's share of total exports. India's manufacturing exports as a share of total goods exports rose from 58 to 64 percent, but in contrast to its highly evolved and sophisticated modern services sector, India's product quality trails that of both China and other EMs (Chart 2). In line with global trends, Indian exports shifted from the European Union and the United States toward emerging and developing economies. East Asia and the Middle East have emerged as the top two destination markets (Chart 3). **Implications for the future** Goods differ in productivity and therefore in their future growth consequences, and development involves not just making more of something but also introducing new, more sophisticated products. Because of revealed comparative advantage, countries tend to add to their export mix whatever is more, rather than less, closely related to the goods already being manufactured (a country has revealed comparative advantage when the share of a given product in a country's total exports is larger than the share of that product in total global exports). India is no exception in the pattern it follows while expanding its export basket. Existing revealed comparative advantage in various products, such as textiles, has led to comparative advantage and export growth in related product clusters, such as fabrics, garment technology, etc. Similarly, emerging comparative advantage in research and development can lead to expansion of other high-value exports of modern services. **Recommendations** The income and employment potential of Indian exports could further benefit from the following structural and policy changes: * Increasing the value and quality of high- and medium-tech manufactured exports (low-skill or low-tech products would likely face an incumbency disadvantage relative to lower-cost producers). * Diversifying services that underpin modern the manufacturing supply chain and capitalizing on emerging comparative advantage in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemical and mechanical-engineering research and development. * Expanding exports to new markets, especially South Asian neighbors. * Optimizing policies to promote export through reducing trade costs; liberalizing foreign direct investment rules; improving urban infrastructure; developing labor's technological skills and the future market's flexibility; and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship to enable higher productivity activities. * New technology and cultural inventions from India would shape the wave of economic growth. For example, California with a population barely 3 percent of India has the GDP which is very similar to India's. It is driven by a pocket of few concentrated yet uniquely specialized hubs of exports within California. Similar clusters with unique new inventions could be a source of growth engine in India too, and would require an enabling environment for openness and creative inventions in India. This could help move faster towards convergence.

But what matters more to the person on the street is how growth translates into jobs. Unfortunately, the mediocre growth outlook of recent years may lead to a disturbing outlook for jobs, particularly among fuel-exporting countries and in the Latin America and Caribbean region. **The global picture** Chart 1 provides a measure of the global unemployment rate based on data for 116 countries, of which 37 countries are classified as \"advanced\" (a term used in the IMF's [_World Economic Outlook_ to refer to high- income countries) and the remaining 79 are emerging and developing economies (for brevity, we refer to the group as \"emerging economies\"). [ The unemployment rate in advanced economies has declined over the past couple of years'with sharp declines in the United States and slower progress in the euro area'and this trend is expected to continue. In contrast, the unemployment rate in emerging economies is expected to increase over the course of this year. Much of this increase is expected to occur in countries where fuel exports are a big share of export earnings. As shown in Chart 2, the unemployment rate in this group is expected to increase to 8.4 percent this year, a full percentage point above the estimate for last year. [ **A look at Latin America** Looking across regions, Latin America and the Caribbean in particular, face a sharp increase in the unemployment rate (Chart 3). In 2016, unemployment in the region is expected to be nearly 8 percent, over two percentage points higher than it was two years ago. This sharp rise is driven by recessions in large economies in the region, such as Brazil. Elsewhere, many economies are growing modestly, thus limiting the labor market deterioration (see the IMF's [_Regional Economic Outlook_ for the Western Hemisphere). [ These increases in the unemployment rate imply job losses for thousands of people across the region. The declines in employment for the cases of Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina are shown in Chart 4. In Brazil, the job loss between 2014 and 2016 is expected at over 2 million people. [ **Weakening beneath the surface** As the Inter-American Development Bank's (IDB) 2016 [report on the region notes, this cloudy outlook for labor markets comes after a decade of progress during which more than 50 million people in the region escaped poverty, inequality fell, and the share of informal workers declined significantly. As of last year, labor markets seemed to remain buoyant, despite the slowdown in growth in the region. However, as an IMF [blog cautioned at the time, 'labor markets are not as strong as they appear'\u009d and there was evidence of 'weakening beneath the surface'\u009d. With the growth outlook marked down further since then, the outlook for the labor market has become much more disturbing. Both the IDB and IMF note that the extent to which growth and jobs are linked varies considerably across countries in the region. Chart 5 shows the so- called [Okun coefficient for countries in the region: this is the estimated historical relationship between unemployment and GDP growth. For the three countries with the biggest increases in unemployment rates'Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela'the link is reasonably strong by the standards of emerging economies. In Brazil and Venezuela, a one percentage point increase in growth lowers the unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage points; in Argentina the impact is about half as strong. [ **Getting people back to work** Restoring the health of labor markets in the Latin America and Caribbean region will thus require a return to stronger growth as well as more targeted measures to tackle barriers in the creation of private sector jobs, which may vary from country to country. In particular, it would be useful to provide assistance for job seekers through a mix of placement services, retraining and'in some instances'subsidies to encourage formal sector employment. In the short-run, the presence of large informal sectors may buffer the increase in formal sector unemployment rates. But the transition to the informal sector is likely to be associated with wage losses in the short-run, and a loss of skills and ability to move to the formal sector if it persists. Hence, a more lasting solution is needed to the emerging unemployment problem in the region.

(Chinese) China's high and rising corporate debt problem and how best to address it has received much attention recently. Indeed, corporate debt in China has risen to about 160 percent of GDP, which is very high compared to other, especially developing, countries. The IMF's April 2016 [_Global Financial Stability Report_ looked at the issue from the viewpoint of commercial banks and resulting vulnerabilities. Its analysis suggests that the share of commercial banks' loans to corporates that could potentially be at risk has been rising fast and, although currently at a manageable level, needs to be addressed with urgency in order to avoid serious problems down the road. Indeed the success in addressing this issue is important for China's economic transition and, given its size and growing global integration, the world's economy at large. Encouragingly, the authorities have announced that they are focusing on the problems of excessive corporate debt and the resulting burden on banks and, indeed, the whole economy. Media have reported on two specific techniques to tackle the country's debt problems: (1) converting Non-Performing Loans ('NPLs'\u009d) into equity and (2) securitizing NPLs (that is repackaging bank loans into marketable securities) and selling them. The IMF staff's international experience provides some useful lessons on these techniques. This blog, and the associated [note, summarizes our findings. The key message is that while such techniques can play a role in addressing these problems and have been used successfully by other countries, they are not comprehensive solutions by themselves. Unless they are carefully designed and part of a sound overall framework, they could actually worsen the problem, for example, by allowing 'zombie'\u009d firms (non-viable firms that are still operating) to keep going. Banks generally also don't have the expertise to run or restructure a business and debt-equity conversions could create conflicts of interest'banks may keep lending to a now-related party. Thus, getting the design right is critical: * **Debt-equity conversions** should convert debt only of viable firms in the context of operational restructuring plans for the firms (which may include changing management), at fair value, and with banks holding the equity for a limited period only. * **NPL securitization **should encompass a diversified pool of NPLs, with banks keeping some residual financial interest ('skin in the game'\u009d), under a legal and operational framework that will allow owners of distressed assets to force operational restructuring of firms and obtain the best value from those assets. Moreover, for these techniques to help address the systemic problem of excessive corporate debt and impaired bank loans more generally, they need to be part of a comprehensive, system-wide plan. Such a plan should, in addition to addressing the social consequences (especially to support laid-off workers), involve the following: * Assessing the viability of distressed firms, and restructuring the viable ones and liquidating the nonviable ones * Requiring banks proactively to recognize and workout NPLs * Burden sharing among banks, corporates, institutional investors, and the government * Enhancing the framework for corporate restructuring, including the Enterprise Insolvency Law * Developing distressed debt markets. Such a comprehensive plan would help allocate resources'labor, capital, and credit'to more productive uses. And it would support, together with the right mix of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, China's broader economic rebalancing towards a more sustainable growth model.

Our back of the envelope calculations show that most large emitters will need to charge anywhere from $50 to $100 per ton or more (in current prices) by 2030 to meet their commitments to reduce carbon emissions. These are quite sizeable numbers: for example a $50 per ton CO2 charge would add $0.12 cents per litre to the pump price for gasoline. And it would almost triple world coal prices. As discussed in a previous [blog, there is widespread recognition (just ask people in business and finance) that on average and over time, CO2 reduction pledges are best met through a robust and predictable emissions price. And the best way to implement CO2 pricing'and provide across-the-board incentives for investments in clean technology'is to charge for the carbon content of fossil fuels. Some background: More than 190 countries came together last December to pledge to do their part to halt global warming. They also agreed to procedures for evaluating progress and updating these pledges. A typical commitment is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 30 percent by 2030 relative to emissions in some baseline year. **Level of carbon pricing** The above figures for carbon pricing come from some highly simplified calculations presented in the table below (assuming carbon pricing is the main mitigation instrument to implement the Paris pledges). Not all countries may need carbon prices of $100 per ton. For example, prices needed to meet carbon targets in Russia are lower than in other countries as Russia's emissions have already fallen substantially relative to 1990, the benchmark year for its emissions pledge. But we should be under no illusions about how far we have to go: only 12 percent of global emissions are currently covered by pricing systems and typically with prices below $10 per ton. What about potential revenues from carbon pricing? Typically, these are well above 1 percent of GDP for the price levels (see table). These large revenues could allow, for example, substantial cuts in burdensome taxes on labor and capital. **A two-step approach** How do we assess needed carbon prices? First, we project a country's future use of coal, natural gas, and petroleum products in the absence of new mitigation policies. This determines 'business as usual' (BAU) CO2 emissions and it depends on income growth, trends in energy efficiency, possible shifts in the future fuel mix from technological and price changes, and so on. Second, we infer the relation between CO2 prices and emissions using assumptions about the responsiveness of fuel use to CO2 pricing'a large empirical literature provides some sense of these fuel price responses based on previous experience. Inevitably, there is a lot of uncertainty in these price estimates. So countries will need transparent and predictable rules for periodically adjusting CO2 pricing trajectories if energy systems evolve in unexpected ways. Emissions prices should also be phased in progressively to allow firms and households time to adjust, limiting risks of scrapping existing capital well before the end of its useful life. For example, a country requiring an estimated CO2 price of $75 per ton by 2030 might plan to increase the emissions price by $5 per ton each year starting this year. **In their own interests** The good news is that many countries are appreciating that carbon pricing can be in [their own interests. The fiscal and domestic health benefits (from cleaner air) can both be substantial, before even counting the benefits for the global climate. And thanks to the Paris Agreement, governments will at least be under considerable pressure from their peers to demonstrate progress on meeting their commitments to reduce carbon emissions, which could create important [momentum for carbon pricing.

A new reality is emerging. Against this backdrop, countries need to _act now_ to boost growth and build resilience. They must also be prepared to _act together_ to fend off global risks. **Worsening public finances** The [April 2016 _Fiscal Monitor_ shows that public debt continues to rise in every corner of the world. Fiscal deficits have also gone up in many countries. In advanced economies, once again, we will have to wait another year for debt ratios to decline. On average, public debt now exceeds the level observed during the Great Depression and is approaching the level immediately after World War II (Chart 1). [ In emerging markets and low-income countries, fiscal deficits in 2016 are projected to be even higher than in 2009 during the global financial crisis. This represents a big shift compared to what we expected about a year ago; there's been a large jump in future public debt ratios (Chart 2). The fiscal positions of commodity exporters have been especially hard hit because of the collapse in revenues. In the Middle East and North Africa, the cumulative fiscal balances of oil exporters alone are set to deteriorate by a staggering $2 trillion in the next five years, compared to the pre-crisis period 2004'08 (Chart 3). [ Fundamental and far-reaching trends of the global economy are affecting public finances everywhere. These transformations include continued weakness in global activity and entrenched low inflation pressures in advanced economies, the decline in commodity prices (about 35 percent in the past 12 months and 65 percent since mid-2014 for oil), and the slowdown in trade. Emerging market and developing economies are also facing higher interest rates and dwindling capital inflows. Risks are also rising almost everywhere. These changes look like they are here to stay, at least for some time. [ Countries need to adapt to these new realities but 'no one-size-fits-all.'\u009d The appropriate policy response varies across countries, but the exact mix of measures depends on the nature of the fiscal challenge they face. We identify three main challenges. **Three challenges** **_Challenge 1: Avoiding the low growth-low inflation trap_** Advanced economies are facing the triple threat of low growth, low inflation, and high public debt. This combination of factors could create self- reinforcing downward spirals. By this, we mean that continuous downward revisions in growth and inflation are associated with upward revisions in public and private debt as a share of GDP. This may lead governments, firms and households to cut spending in order to lower debt, depressing further economic activity and inflation. To avert falling into such a trap, countries should follow a three-pronged approach based on expansionary monetary policy, growth-friendly fiscal policy and productivity-enhancing structural reforms. By growth-friendly fiscal policy, we mean measures that boost growth both in the short- and the medium- term (such as higher infrastructure investment) and policy actions that support the implementation of structural reforms. One example of this is using public funds to compensate those that lose from reforms (such as reforms promoting greater competition) and who could block their adoption. In countries with fiscal space, the budget could also do more to support aggregate demand. Many countries lack this fiscal space and, of course, how much countries can do to support demand will depend on individual country circumstances'particularly on their debt level and current and future borrowing costs. In some cases, countries will not be able to slow down fiscal adjustment. But even in these circumstances, governments should protect growth by avoiding cuts to highly productive public spending and scaling down less efficient programs instead. And what if the macroeconomic situation gets worse? What should countries do if there is a large slowdown in global growth and intensifying deflationary pressures which could precipitate the world economy into the downward spirals that we have just described? Then individual country's responses would not be sufficient. Policymakers should _act quickly and act together_ to fight the stagnation forces and deploy coordinated policies across the major economies of the world. The international response should combine growth-friendly policies on the demand and supply sides. It is particularly important that countries act simultaneously, because the beneficial effects from each country's policies would be amplified. Of course, some economies would not be able to participate in the coordinated policy response, in particular those under market pressure. But they would still benefit indirectly from higher growth elsewhere through stronger trade and improved global stability. **_Challenge 2: Addressing _****_the big and lasting drop in_****_ revenue_****_s_** Between 2014 and 2016, about two-thirds of all countries experienced a decline in their revenue-to-GDP ratios (Chart 4). Commodity exporters saw the largest revenue shortfalls'an average of 7 percent of GDP for oil exporters. As commodity prices are likely to remain low for some time, producers have no choice but to reduce public spending and align it with lower revenues. Nonetheless, this unavoidable adjustment can be made less painful by mobilizing non-commodity revenues and cutting poorly targeted and wasteful spending, including by reforming fuel subsidies. Countries that have accumulated financial assets in the past and are under less pressure from financial markets will be able to consolidate at a more gradual pace. [ **_Challenge 3: Achieving development goals with constrained budgetary resources_** Almost half of the low-income developing countries have a tax ratio below 15 percent of GDP. Low revenue mobilization is an important impediment to economic development not only because it limits the ability to fund pro-growth spending but also because a low tax ratio is often associated with a lack of institutional capacity, which is essential for growth to take off. Thus, adequate revenue mobilization is a fundamental component of a growth and development strategy. Building up a minimum tax capacity can support and complement broader state and legal capacity. In particular, stable taxation that is broad-based and governed by clear rules, is necessary for an effective budget process. Combined with improvements in expenditure efficiency, better revenue mobilization can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including by enhancing the provision of health and education services and developing infrastructure. In practice, low-income countries should explore possibilities for raising new forms of revenue (for instance, by introducing or expanding the value added tax or the property tax) and strengthening tax compliance'two areas in which the IMF provides extensive technical assistance. **Medium-term objectives** Beyond the country-specific immediate policy responses outlined above, there are two main objectives that all countries should pursue over the medium term: * **_Enhancing the resilience of public finances_**_._ In a risky environment, a key objective of fiscal policy is to make public finances less sensitive to shocks, such as a drop in commodity prices or a currency depreciation. But how can government reduce vulnerabilities? Principally by working on three fronts. First, countries can improve how they disclose and analyze risks. A comprehensive, reliable, and timely public reporting on the state of public finances can reduce the likelihood and magnitude of negative surprises. Such events are not uncommon. For instance, governments often provide guarantees to the private sector that may prove very costly when they are exercised. It is very important to disclose such guarantees, so that they do not pop up unexpectedly. Second, countries should take concrete measures to mitigate the risks they have identified. Very few countries have developed risk management strategies that actively reduce the probability that risks may occur and limit the government's exposure to risk. Taking our previous example, countries could introduce caps to the amount of guarantees provided by the government. Third, governments should create adequate cushions to absorb the remaining risks that cannot be mitigated. For instance, budgets should include adequate 'provisions,'\u009d which are safety margins to cope with unexpected events. * **_Promoting sustainable growth_**. Raising medium-term growth is necessary in all countries. In advanced economies, a lasting solution to the high debt problem is not possible without higher growth. In fact, a sustained increase in growth of 1 percentage point could bring debt ratios in advanced economies to their pre-crisis levels within a decade. In emerging and developing countries, strong growth is also warranted to raise living standards and finance development strategies. How do we increase growth? An [IMF study suggests reforms of tax and expenditure policies could lift medium- to [long-term growth by \u00c2\u00be of a percentage point in advanced economies and even more in developing economies. The [analysis in Chapter 2 of the _Fiscal Monitor_ shows that some fiscal measures are very powerful tools for fostering innovation and productivity. In particular, fiscal support to private research and development (in the form of research and development tax credits or subsidies) costing 0.4 percent of GDP to the budget'less than half a percent of GDP'can deliver 5 percent higher GDP in advanced economies in the long run. In sum, countries face big challenges in restoring vigorous growth, and healthy and resilient public finances. But the good news is that policymakers, individually and in concert, still have adequate policy tools to address these challenges and adapt to the new realities.

These risks were highlighted yesterday at the _[World Economic Outlook_ press conference. * Second, falling commodity prices and concerns about China's economy have put pressure on emerging markets and advanced economy credit markets. * Finally, confidence in policy traction has slipped, amid concerns about the ability of overburdened monetary policies to offset the impact of higher economic and political risks. Earlier in the year, markets reacted negatively to these developments. Global equities plummeted; volatility rose sharply; talk of recession in advanced economies increased; and bank equity prices came under renewed pressure. Today the situation in markets appears significantly better compared to the lows of mid-February. Equity markets have recovered much of their losses and oil prices are higher, while volatility has subsided. This improvement followed some better news on the economic front, as well as intensified policy actions by the European Central Bank, and a more cautious stance toward raising rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. China has also stepped up efforts to strengthen its policy framework to bolster growth and stabilize the exchange rate. A key question that this [_Global Financial Stability Report_ edition addresses is whether the turmoil that we have seen over the past months is now safely behind us, or is it a warning signal that more needs to be done? I believe it is the latter: more needs to be done to secure global stability. Much is at stake. Additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix. If not, market turmoil may recur and intensify, and could create a pernicious feedback loop of fragile confidence, weaker growth, tighter financial conditions, and rising debt burdens. This could tip the global economy into economic and financial stagnation. In such a scenario, we estimate that world output could fall by almost 4 percent, relative to our baseline projections, over the next five years (Figure 1). This would be roughly equivalent to forgoing one year of global growth. [ So what needs to be done? We need to go beyond the status quo. We need a collective approach to policymaking to tackle a triad of global challenges. These are the same challenges that I underscored six months ago, namely crisis legacy issues still unaddressed in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and systemic market liquidity risks. The market turbulence we experienced earlier this year is a powerful reminder of this unfinished business. Let me discuss now the challenges facing advanced economies and emerging markets, and what needs to be done to address them. Tackling these challenges will enable to expand world output by up to 1.7 percent, relative to the baseline, over the next five years (Figure 1). That is like securing an additional half a year of global growth. The first challenge to tackle is crisis legacies in advanced economies, particularly banks, as they play a key role in financing the economy. Banks in advanced economies are now considerably safer. Yet they came under significant market pressures at the start of the year, as the economic outlook weakened and became more uncertain. But banks also face important structural challenges in adapting to the new post-crisis realities that continue to depress their profitability. Many banks in advanced economies face significant business model challenges. We estimate that these banks account for about 15 percent of bank assets in advanced economies (Figure 2). In the euro area, market pressures also highlight long standing legacy issues. Elevated nonperforming loans urgently need to be tackled using a comprehensive strategy and excess bank capacity'namely, too many banks'will have to be addressed over time. Europe must also complete the banking union and establish a common deposit guarantee scheme. [ The second key challenge to tackle is from emerging markets. The sharp fall in commodity prices has exacerbated both corporate and sovereign vulnerabilities, keeping economic and financial risks elevated. After years of growing indebtedness, emerging economies face a difficult combination of slower growth, tighter credit conditions, and volatile capital flows. So far, many economies have shown remarkable resilience to this difficult environment, thanks to the judicious use of buffers accumulated during the boom years. But buffers are depleting quickly, with some countries running out of room to maneuver. As the health of the corporate sector deteriorates, especially in commodity exporting countries and commodity related sectors, refinancing pressures may become more acute. This can generate spillovers to the government, as many weaker corporates are state owned. Bank buffers are generally adequate in many emerging markets but may be tested by increasing nonperforming loans (Figure 3). These interlinkages underscore the importance of close monitoring of corporate vulnerabilities, swift and transparent recognition and management of nonperforming assets, and strengthening the resilience of banks. [ Among emerging economies, the most important one is China. China continues to navigate a complex transition to a slower and more balanced pace of growth and a more market-based financial system. The Chinese authorities have advanced reforms but the transition remains inherently complex. Here, the corporate-bank nexus is also critical. Despite progress on economic rebalancing, corporate health in China is declining due to slowing growth and lower profitability. This is reflected in the rising share of debt held by firms that do not earn enough to cover their interest payments. This measure, which we label 'debt at risk,'\u009d has increased to 14 percent of the debt of listed Chinese companies, more than tripling since 2010. Increased strains in Chinese firms are important to Chinese banks. This report estimates that corporate bank loans potentially at risk in China amount to almost US$1.3 trillion. These loans could translate into potential bank losses of approximately 7 percent of GDP (Figure 4). This number may seem large but it is manageable, given China's bank and policy buffers and continued strong growth in the economy. Equally important, the Chinese authorities are aware of these vulnerabilities and are putting in place measures to deal with the over indebted corporates. Yet, the magnitude of these vulnerabilities calls for an ambitious policy agenda: 1) addressing the corporate debt overhang, 2) strengthening banks, and 3) upgrading the supervisory framework to support an increasingly complex financial system. [ We need to work collectively to strengthen growth and financial stability beyond the current baseline. This is doable. Policymakers need to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix that goes beyond continued overreliance on monetary policy. Monetary policy remains crucial but cannot be the only game in town. Well-designed structural reforms and growth-friendly and supportive fiscal policies are essential. In addition, stronger financial policies that further enhance resilience must be put in place. At the global level, the financial regulatory reform agenda must also be completed and implemented'including for nonbanks. All of these actions will help bring balance to the policy mix, and together will make policies more potent and effective.

Growth has been too slow for too long. The new [_World Economic Outlook_ released today anticipates a slight acceleration in growth this year, from 3.1 to 3.2 percent, followed by 3.5 percent growth in 2017. Our projections, however, continue to be progressively less optimistic over time. The downgraded forecasts reflect a broad-based slowdown across all countries. That slowdown results from continuing trends that we have highlighted in earlier editions of the _World Economic Outlook_. As always, there is considerable diversity in performance within groups. The central scenario that the _World Economic Outlook _projects, however, now looks less likely compared with possible less favorable outcomes. Both to support global growth and to guard against downside risks to that baseline scenario, we propose a three-pronged policy approach based on monetary, fiscal and structural policies. What risks concern us the most? Prominent among them are financial and non economic risks: * Since last summer, we have seen two distinct rounds of global financial turbulence. They featured abrupt sell-offs of risky assets, heightened risk aversion, spikes in emerging-market sovereign spreads, and sharp falls in prices of oil and other commodities. Markets largely recovered both times, but investors have arguably reacted more than changing fundamentals would have warranted, both on the downswing and the upswing. There is a risk that further bouts of volatility feed through to the broader economy. As the new [_Global Financial Stability Report_ documents, these financial swings overlie a steady trend of global financial tightening. The factors behind it include increasing net capital outflows from emerging markets. While most have managed to cope with these so far, as this _World Economic Outlook _discusses, more strains could begin to appear. * Continuing violent instability in a number of countries, notably Syria, continues to crater their economies, driving millions of refugees to surrounding countries as well as to Europe. This is a humanitarian disaster. It has challenged the European Union's capacity to preserve open internal borders, and as the incidence of terrorism has increased, the strains have only grown. Coupled with other economic pressures, the result in Europe has been a rising tide of inward-looking nationalism. One manifestation is the real possibility that the United Kingdom exits the European Union, damaging a wide range of trade and investment relationships At the same time, across Europe, the political consensus that once propelled the European project is fraying. In other advanced countries as in Europe, including in the United States, a backlash against cross-border economic integration threatens to halt or even reverse the postwar trend of ever more open trade. And unfortunately, there is more. Several large emerging market economies face deep contractions due to internal political strife or geopolitical pressures, and a number of low-income and emerging market countries suffer El Ni\u00c3?o-related drought or flooding. The costs could escalate. These risks could more easily undermine a baseline outcome that is more fragile owing to lower growth: * The weaker is growth, the greater the chance that the preceding risks, if some materialize, pull the world economy below stalling speed, where demand is insufficient to avoid a low-growth, deflationary equilibrium that some economists have characterized as secular stagnation. * In many countries, lack of wage growth and greater inequality have created a widespread sense that economic growth has benefited mobile elites and owners of capital disproportionately, leaving too many others behind. Lower growth reinforces the turn toward inward-looking and nationalistic policies. * In brief: lower growth means less room for error. We are not presently in a crisis. As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has put it, our state is one of alert, not alarm. In this environment, **policymakers should focus on two tasks.** The first task is to strengthen the baseline outcome by strengthening growth. This is valuable in itself, of course, but also gives important insurance against downside risks. The second task is to make contingency plans for a possible future in which downside risks nonetheless materialize. For both tasks, effective policy requires a three-pronged approach. Continued monetary accommodation is appropriate where deflationary pressures'which are dangerous in themselves'and negative output gaps remain. But monetary policy needs support from the two other policy prongs, fiscal and structural policies. For a number of countries, infrastructure investment looks attractive'both from a short- and a long-term perspective'at the currently low real borrowing rates their governments face. Fiscal support of research and development could have a notably rich payoff, as the latest _Fiscal Monitor_ shows_. _Balanced budget tax reforms can move fiscal policy in more growth-friendly directions, while also better supporting aggregate demand, labor force participation, and social cohesion. As this latest [_World Economic Outlook_ explains, a range of well-sequenced structural reforms can boost potential output, especially if accompanied by complementary fiscal support. Pro- competitive product market reforms in particular, such as those implemented with considerable success in Canada, the Netherlands, and Spain two decades ago, and in Italy in the 2000s, can be expansionary in the near term. Finally, further financial sector strengthening, as detailed in the _Global Financial Stability Report_, is essential to create a context in which monetary, fiscal, and structural policies can be more effective. But policymakers should not ignore the need to prepare for possible adverse outcomes. They should identify mutually reinforcing fiscal and structural policy packages to deploy collectively in the future in case downside risks materialize. In addition, continuing international cooperation to improve both the functioning of the international monetary system and the stability of international finance are vital for global economic resilience. That work has progressed considerably since the global financial crisis, but there is more to be done. With its downside possibilities, the current diminished outlook calls for an immediate, proactive response. To repeat: there is no longer much room for error. But by clearly recognizing the risks they jointly face and acting together to prepare for them, national policymakers can bolster confidence, support growth, and guard more effectively against the risk of a derailed recovery.

Such bold policy action is unprecedented, and its effects over time will vary among countries. There have been negative real rates in a number of countries over time; it is negative nominal rates that are new. Our analysis takes a broad view of recent events to examine what is new, country experiences so far, the effectiveness of negative nominal rates as well as their limits and their unintended consequences. Although the experience with negative nominal interest rates is limited, we tentatively conclude that overall, they help deliver additional monetary stimulus and easier financial conditions, which support demand and price stability. Still, there are limits on how far and for how long negative policy rates can go. **Why are central banks using negative policy rates?** Once policy rates are cut to what used to be known as the 'zero lower bound', central banks can employ unconventional monetary policy measures to provide further stimulus if real interest rates are still above the levels consistent with price stability and full employment. Negative nominal policy interest rates are the latest addition to this unconventional toolkit. Six central banks so far have introduced negative rates that apply to some amount of the cash balances commercial banks hold with the central bank (Table 1). Negative rates aim to encourage the private sector to spend more and support price stability by further easing monetary and financial conditions. For smaller open economies, negative rates can also help discourage capital inflows and reduce exchange rate appreciation pressures. There are synergies between negative policy interest rates and quantitative easing. Negative policy rates have thus far been associated with expanded central bank balance sheets as a result of quantitative easing or large-scale foreign exchange purchases. Quantitative easing compresses yields and term premia, though it has some limits since over time it reduces the availability of assets for further purchases by the central bank. Moving policy rates negative aims to lower money market rates and push down the yield curve further, and boost portfolio substitution effects, thereby increasing the potency of monetary policy. In fact, negative deposit rates tend to have more bite when a large amount of commercial banks' reserves are priced at the negative rate. **What's new?** Negative real rates have been seen in both advanced and emerging markets and developing economies when inflation is higher than nominal interest rates. It is negative nominal interest rates that are new. When nominal rates become negative, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy may also differ as there are non-linearities associated with the downward stickiness of retail deposit rates. The latter are unlikely to fall below zero as retail depositors could switch to cash to avoid the negative rate. **How do negative policy rates work? The experience so far** There are several transmission channels of negative rates: through portfolio rebalancing, bank lending, and via the exchange rate. The portfolio balance channel appears to have operated normally at negative rates. Wholesale interest rates have fallen with central bank deposit rates (see Chart 1). Money market trading activities appeared to have declined, but it is not clear whether these effects reflect negative rates per se, or the substantial surplus liquidity associated with quantitative easing that reduces the demand for trading. Lower risk-free wholesale rates have tended to encourage investors to switch from low yield government securities to riskier assets such as equities, corporate bonds, or property. In addition, lower wholesale interest rates have reduced the cost of funds for those borrowers such as large corporates who can directly finance in commercial paper and corporate bond markets. [ The impact of negative rates on bank lending has differed across banks, reflecting different funding models and lending practices. While wholesale bank funding costs have fallen, decreases in lending rates have been limited by retail deposits remaining anchored at zero or above. Banks that rely more heavily on customer deposits for funding have hence been less able to reduce lending rates. In most cases, lending rates have fallen since the introduction of negative policy rates but there is a wider dispersion of experiences compared to wholesale markets. Some retail lending rates have even increased somewhat (see Chart 2). Lending rates have tended to fall more in banking systems with a higher proportion of variable rate loans, shorter loan maturities, or high levels of competition among banks. This explains why corporate loan rates appear to have fallen further than retail rates, in part reflecting a greater prevalence of loans indexed to the interbank market. In terms of lending volumes, while it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, credit growth in the euro area for example, has picked up since the introduction of negative rates. [ Banks benefit overall from policies that support price stability and growth, through stronger borrower creditworthiness, lower nonperforming loans, reduced provisioning costs, and capital gains on the securities they hold, and those more reliant on wholesale funding have seen a reduction in costs. Yet banks' net interest margins appear to have been squeezed by the combination of negative rates and quantitative easing, although this pressure has been offset to some extent due to a number of mitigating factors. Some banks have been able to raise alternative sources of income through fees or commissions. Many central banks have exempted a portion of commercial bank balances held at the central bank from the negative rate (the so called 'tiering'\u009d system) thus reducing any potentially perverse impact on bank margins. The impact of negative central bank rates on the exchange rate has been mixed. Portfolio rebalancing in some cases has led to cross-border capital outflows and exchange rate depreciation. In some cases central bank actions have had the beneficial effect of reducing capital inflows (for example in Denmark) while elsewhere other factors have driven the exchange rate. **Are there limits to the use of negative policy rates?** The use of negative policy rates may have its limits'both in terms of the extent to which central banks can set rates at negative levels and the length of time they can remain negative. Individuals and corporates could substantially increase the use of cash as a store of value'and even as a means of payment'if rates are expected to be substantially negative and for a long time. Indeed, so could banks: instead of working balances held at the central bank to cover interbank transactions, banks could hold vault cash for settlement between each other. Ballpark estimates by staff for the tipping point at which a move into cash would become worthwhile range from minus 75 basis points (bps) to minus 200 bps. Some of the costs of using cash as a store of value, or for large-value transactions, are of a one-off nature: these might include expanding vault capacity, transporting cash to private sector vaults, and setting up systems. Since these one-off costs would be spread over time, the length of time for which negative rates were expected to endure would be important both in the decision of whether or not to undertake them, and for the interest-rate equivalent added cost to transactions. The tipping point will likely vary by country. It would also be influenced by the value of the highest denomination banknotes. The physical space required for storing US$1 million equivalent would be similar in Denmark, Hungary, Japan, and the United States; but lower in the eurozone and Switzerland where there are higher denomination notes (EUR 500 and CHF 1,000). There is some evidence of the demand for large value notes increasing in Switzerland already (see Chart 3). [ But perhaps more important than the physical limits as described above, there may also be significant political economy and social limits to the use of negative nominal interest rates. The public may feel that they are being 'taxed'\u009d if and when deposit rates increasingly turn negative. As a result, public support for the negative interest rate policy could be weakened. **Are there unintended consequences?** Commentators have focused on the potential negative impact of negative rates on bank profitability. Banks appear to have been unwilling or unable to reduce retail deposit rates to negative territory, and their net interest margins may have been squeezed. Overall, as mentioned before, to the extent that negative interest rates help to support domestic demand, banks are likely to benefit through improved credit quality, reduced nonperforming loans, and increased loan demand. They may enjoy capital gains on their bond holdings. Admittedly, for banks that are unable to generate greater earnings by increasing the volume of their lending, or by charging fees to depositors, negative rates could be a significant profitability challenge. Another concern is that if policy rates remain negative for too long, there could be increasing spillovers to savers, with negative social consequences, although this is true also of low, positive rates. If low or negative rates persist, they could undermine the viability of life insurers, pensions, and savings vehicles. Low rates make it difficult for insurers to meet guaranteed returns, and with substantial duration mismatches, this will eventually force losses on life insurance policy holders. There may also be excessive risk-taking. As banks' margins are squeezed, they may start lending to riskier borrowers to maintain their profit levels. Banks may also be encouraged to rely more on cheaper but volatile wholesale funding sources. Weak loans could become harder to detect, and vital corporate restructuring could be delayed. Negative interest rates may induce boom and bust cycles in asset prices. These potential risks require close monitoring and supervisory scrutiny. Prudential authorities may need to respond with stronger policy actions. Although the experience with negative nominal interest rates is limited, we tentatively conclude that overall, they help deliver additional monetary stimulus. Wholesale interest rates have fallen as have some bank lending rates, which should help support demand and price stability. Still, it's important to emphasize that, while monetary policy is critical to the battle against weak growth and deflationary pressures, there appear to be limits on how far and for how long negative policy rates can go. This underscores that monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. It should be part of a balanced and potent approach that also includes well-designed structural reforms, growth-friendly and supportive fiscal policies, and prudential policies that enhance the resilience of the financial sector.

Without good data, it is difficult to assess how an economy is performing and formulate smart policies that help improve lives. In little over twenty years, the southern African country of Mozambique has gone from having no national accounts or consumer price index to creating one of the leading statistical agencies in Sub-Saharan Africa. I saw firsthand Mozambique's progress in collecting data on my recent trip to Africa. It was my first trip there as an official representative of the IMF. I met with Isaltina Lucas, the then-President of Mozambique's Institute of Statistics (and now Vice-Minister of Economy and Finance), who told me about the government's impressive strides in compiling key economic statistics'thanks, in part, to the IMF. Over the course of my 10-day visit in early March, I saw many more instances of how IMF technical assistance and training'which together we call '[capacity development'\u009d'is helping policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa take charge of their own economic future. **Tapping the experience of peers** In Tanzania, for example, I witnessed [a workshop organized jointly by the IMF and the central bank, where officials from across the region discussed their own countries' experiences with expanding access to finance and exchanged views on how to deal with financial vulnerabilities that are emerging as a result. Many participants emphasized the importance of this type of experience-sharing'known as 'peer-to-peer learning'\u009d'in building capacity. We are hearing more and more that the knowledge-sharing that takes place outside formal courses is important for capacity development. So we have been exploring ways to cultivate peer learning and support, both in person and online. Through such platforms, policymakers facing similar challenges can not only learn from each other but also set common policy goals. Such efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Take, for example, Senegal, which is successfully using peer learning to implement its new development strategy with the goal of becoming an emerging market economy within the next two decades. Senegal is drawing on the experience of policymakers in Cape Verde, Mauritius, and Seychelles to introduce tax identification numbers, set up credit information bureaus, and develop tourism and special economic zones. **Hands-on learning** I also saw how capacity development is an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with member countries. When the IMF makes certain recommendations in its regular monitoring of economies, it's not enough for us to give policy advice or leave a technical report; we need to work hands-on with officials to give them practical tools to implement that advice. Our country teams and fiscal experts work closely together, for example, when giving advice about how to broaden the tax base or spend more productively. And we are in the process of strengthening our knowledge management systems to make sure expert knowledge can easily be shared throughout the IMF. Capacity development does not follow the same formula everywhere'it must be tailored to country needs and integrated into development strategies. In Africa, as in other parts of the world, we anchor our capacity development in the economic realities of countries'which is easier to do when the IMF is present on the ground in [regionally based centers. In our [Africa Training Institute in Mauritius, for example, I participated in a regional conference on the future of monetary integration in Africa, a topic that is highly relevant as the region makes plans to deepen monetary integration, including setting up an [East Africa Monetary Union. In addition to being tailored to country circumstances, capacity development also needs to adapt to the evolving global economic conditions. In 2014, the IMF co-sponsored a major conference in [Mozambique on the theme of '[Africa Rising.'\u009d We recognized at the time that, while many African countries are blessed with natural resources, this blessing can easily become a curse. So we worked with governments to begin putting in place strong fiscal frameworks to manage resource revenues for the benefit of current and future generations. Fast forward two years, and the officials I met now see the urgency of having stronger fiscal frameworks as they grapple with the effects of oil and other commodities' plunging price, something few saw coming. This underscores the need for countries to build cushions and develop the capacity'in good times and in bad'to respond to potential shocks. The IMF will continue to work closely with not just the countries on the recipient end but also the many partners around the world whose financial support enables us to provide capacity development advice in the first place. **The people behind the numbers** As I reflect on my first trip to Africa for the IMF, one thing that sticks in my mind is people's faces. In [Tanzania, I visited the Watoto Wetu orphanage (which means 'Our Children'\u009d in Swahili). As I arrived, the kids were singing a song they had prepared for me. After all the meetings discussing complex economic policy choices with officials, this was a good reminder of the real purpose of our work. What we want is for those kids to have a better life, a better future'and capacity development can help us get there.

The work on emerging economies shows that changes in their asset prices explain over a third of the rise and fall in global equity prices and exchange rates. The [IMF analysis finds that rising financial ties, more than emerging economies' growing share of global GDP and trade, is the key factor behind their increasing financial impact on other countries. For example, while economic news from China does affect global equity returns, spillovers from Chinese asset price shocks remain limited relative to those of financially more integrated emerging market economies including Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. The [analysis of life insurers in major advanced economies shows they have contributed more risk to the financial system as a whole since the global financial crisis. Insurers are large institutional investors holding over $24 trillion in global assets and longer-term liabilities, and they have become more exposed to swings in asset prices in recent years. Low interest rates are another important source of risk for insurers. And the lower the level of interest rates, the more vulnerable insurers become to further interest rate changes. The IMF will release more analysis of the global financial system on April 13. You can check out the press conference live [here.

Or think of how developments in information technology, e-commerce and the sharing economy are already changing the way we learn, work, shop, and travel. Innovation drives progress and, in economic terms, determines productivity growth. And productivity growth, in turn, determines prosperity. It impacts our lives and well-being in fundamental ways: it determines where and how long we live; it determines our quality of life. In the spring 2016 _[Fiscal Monitor, _we look at innovation as shaped by effort and incentives. That makes innovation highly dependent on government policies. We find that a little government support can go a long way in boosting innovation and growth. For example, we document that public policies that would reduce the cost of private R&amp;D by 40 percent will lead to increases in private sector effort by the same percentage, and increase GDP by 5 percent over the long run. **A case against pessimism** After the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the world was dominated by pessimists. In 1941, in his Lowell Lectures, Joseph Schumpeter summarized the state of the debate: 'The explanation that has been offered by all sorts of sources and accepted by economists of very high standing is that this depression and unsatisfactory recovery was not due to the unfavorable circumstances of the particular case but had a deeper meaning. It has held to be a symptom that paralysis was slowly creeping upon the economic system of capitalism and that the depressive conditions of capitalism had come to stay; '\u00a6 we may as well put the theory in the form of decreasing investment opportunity.'\u009d It is interesting that more than ten years earlier, in 1930, in his _Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren_, John Maynard Keynes argues vigorously against pessimism. He writes: 'I would predict that the standard of life in the progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is today.'\u009d If we simplify the prediction and take progressive countries to mean the United States (the country that defined the technological frontier during the relevant decades) we can picture Keynes's prediction as in Chart 1. The chart shows in log scale the upper and the low-end of the range indicated by Keynes. Perhaps ironically the initial performance was not inspiring. But, since the early 1950s, the U.S. economy has actually performed _above_ the upper end of Keynes's bands. We interpret this story as indicating that, while the details of innovation are fundamentally unpredictable, innovation is determined by human incentives and can be anticipated in broad outline. **Why fiscal support?** Research and development (R&amp;D) is a key driver of innovation. Governments play a critical role in funding higher education and basic research, the basis upon which firms can build their own R&amp;D. But fiscal policies are also important to foster private R&amp;D investment. Private firms by themselves don't invest enough in R&amp;D for two reasons. First, they often find it difficult to finance risky R&amp;D investment projects, even if the projects are expected to yield high returns. This is especially so during recessions when liquidity constraints are more prevalent. Our new analysis finds that fiscal policies that help stabilize output do significantly raise private R&amp;D investments and support productivity growth. Second, R&amp;D investments by firms benefit the wider economy. For example, researchers in technological hot spots such as California's Silicon Valley exchange knowledge and ideas; technologies embodied in new products or equipment can be imitated by others or can inspire follow-on innovations. But a single firm will not take these spillovers into account when deciding how much to invest in R&amp;D. We find that fiscal incentives should reduce the firm's cost of investing in R&amp;D by 50 percent on average in advanced economies, to encourage firms to do more R&amp;D. This would efficiently reap the benefits for the wider economy. Such fiscal incentive would increase R&amp;D by approximately 40 percent compared with current levels and lift GDP in advanced economies by 5 percent in the long term. International spillovers add to these domestic R&amp;D spillovers. Adopting foreign technologies is a key component for catching-up growth that is critical for emerging markets and developing economies. Estimates suggest that R&amp;D undertaken in the G7 countries yield productivity gains in other economies of about 25 percent of the G7's own return. Taking that into account, global R&amp;D should rise by 50 percent and global GDP could increase by about 8 percent in the long term. **Design and implementation are key** While fiscal incentives can be a powerful tool to encourage private R&amp;D, their design and implementation is critical. Fiscal incentives to encourage R&amp;D vary widely. Australia and Korea, for instance, grant R&amp;D tax credits that effectively reduce the costs of extra R&amp;D investment by nearly 50 percent. Other countries sometimes grant labor-cost relief for researchers or provide targeted R&amp;D subsidies, although in most countries at rates of less than 50 percent. Overall, these policies seem to have worked well, provided that their implementation was effective. Not all fiscal incentive policies are well designed. Several countries have recently introduced so-called patent box regimes, which reduce corporate tax burdens on income from patents. Our results indicate that, in some countries, these regimes have had no discernible impact on R&amp;D at all (see Chart 2). In countries where they did have an impact, the fiscal costs are quite significant. Governments could have used these lost revenues better to provide direct incentives for R&amp;D. And in many cases, patent boxes are simply part of an aggressive tax competition strategy, creating negative impact on the tax base of other countries. **Focus on the entrepreneurs** Many radical innovations result from small entrepreneurial ventures engaging in experimentation. Innovation therefore depends critically on an efficient process of entrepreneurial entry, growth and exit. However, in many countries this process is hampered by obstacles, such as permits and licenses, labor- market regulations, financial constraints and tax barriers. In the _[Fiscal Monitor_, we explore the importance of tax distortions and find evidence of some adverse effects of high corporate income taxes on entrepreneurship. Governments in some countries try to neutralize these tax distortions by offering special tax incentives for small companies. However, these incentives are not cost effective and can even discourage firms from growing due to a so-called small- business trap. For example, lower taxes for small firms lead to 'bunching'\u009d, an accumulation of small firms all trying to remain just below the income level at which the preferential treatment is phased out (see Chart 3). This constrains rather than supports productivity growth. Instead of providing incentives to small firms, governments should target fiscal support to new firms. ", "index": 131}, {"pub": "3/24/2016", "title": "Oil Prices and the Global Economy: It\u2019s Complicated", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=11986", "content": " By [Maurice Obstfeld, [Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, and [Rabah Arezki Oil prices have been persistently low for well over a year and a half now, but as the April 2016 _World Economic Outlook_ will document, the widely anticipated '[shot in the arm'\u009d for the global economy has yet to materialize. We argue that, paradoxically, global benefits from low prices will likely appear only after prices have recovered somewhat, and advanced economies have made more progress surmounting the current low interest rate environment. Since June 2014 oil prices have dropped about 65 percent in U.S. dollar terms (about $70) as growth has progressively slowed across a broad range of countries. Even taking into account the 20 percent dollar appreciation during this period (in nominal effective terms), the decline in oil prices in local currency has been on average over $60. This outcome has puzzled many observers including us at the Fund, who had believed that oil-price declines would be a [net plus for the world economy, obviously hurting exporters but delivering more-than-offsetting gains to importers. The key assumption behind that belief is a specific difference in saving behavior between oil importers and oil exporters: consumers in oil importing regions such as Europe have a higher marginal propensity to consume out of income than those in exporters such as Saudi Arabia. World equity markets have clearly not subscribed to this theory. Over the past six months or more, equity markets have tended to fall when oil prices fall'not what we would expect if lower oil prices help the world economy on balance. Indeed, since August 2015 the simple correlation between equity and oil prices has not only been positive (Chart 1), it has doubled in comparison to an earlier period starting in August 2014 (though not to an unprecedented level). [ Past episodes of sharp changes in oil prices have tended to have visible countercyclical effects'for example, slower world growth after big [increases. Is this time different? Several factors affect the relation between oil prices and growth, but we will argue that a big difference from previous episodes is that many advanced economies have nominal interest rates at or near zero. **Supply versus demand** One obvious problem in predicting the effects of oil-price movements is that a fall in the world price can result either from an increase in global supply or a decrease in global demand. But in the latter case, we would expect to see exactly the same pattern as in recent quarters'falling prices accompanied by slowing global growth, with lower oil prices cushioning, but likely not reversing, the growth slowdown. Slowing demand is no doubt part of the story, but the evidence suggests that increased supply is at least as important. More generally, oil supply has been strong owing to record high output from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) including, now, exports from Iran, as well as from some non-OPEC countries. In addition, the U.S. supply of shale oil initially proved surprisingly resilient in the face of lower prices. Chart 2 shows how OPEC output has recently continued to grow as prices have fallen, unlike in some previous cycles. [ Moreover, even in the United States, a net oil importer where demand has been fairly strong, cheap oil seems not to have given a substantial fillip to growth. Econometric and [other studies suggest that only part of the recent decline in oil is due to slowing demand'somewhere between a [half and a [third'with the balance accounted for by increasing supply. So there remains a puzzle: where in the world can the positive effects of lower oil prices be seen? To address this question, the forthcoming April 2016 _World Economic Outlook_ compares 2015 domestic demand growth in oil importers and oil exporters to what we expected in April 2015'after the first substantial decline in oil prices. The lion's share of the downward revision for global demand comes from oil exporters'despite their relatively small share of global GDP (about 12 percent). But domestic demand in oil importers was also no better than we had forecast, despite a fall in oil prices that was bigger than anticipated. Understanding why the naked eye cannot detect positive spending effects requires a closer look at the composition of demand in oil exporters and importers. **Domestic demand in oil exporters** In 2015, domestic demand in oil exporters was indeed much weaker than we had forecast a year before. This negative surprise reflected both weaker consumption and especially weaker investment. Rich oil exporters can draw on their reserves or [sovereign wealth funds, and most of them have, but they have also been cutting government spending sharply. Poorer countries, of course, have much lower borrowing capacity, and risk crises if foreign debt levels get too high. Most have sharply lower current account surpluses or higher deficits, and their sovereign spreads have risen. In these countries domestic spending can fall sharply, in a [nonlinear fashion'sometimes through the impact of large exchange rate depreciations that make imported goods more expensive. Public investment has fallen especially fast'most capital goods are imported, and when fiscal adjustment is needed, capital spending is typically the first item to be cut. And of course, factors unrelated to oil prices have also being weighing on economic activity in a number of oil exporters'ranging from domestic strife in Iraq, Libya, and Yemen to sanctions in Russia. Of course, low oil prices make exploration and extraction activities less profitable in the private sector, leading to lower capital expenditures there as well. According to Rystad Energy, the fall in global capital expenditure in the oil and gas sector amounted to about $215 billion between 2014 and 2015'about 1.2 percent of global fixed capital formation (or just below 0.3 percent of global GDP). Even some oil importers have been hit hard, notably the United States, which accounts for a significant part of the global drop in energy-related investment. **Domestic demand in oil importers** Advanced oil importing economies have indeed seen some positive effects on consumption'for instance, in the euro area'but the impact has been somewhat less than anticipated. And investment growth has fallen short of expectations'also reflecting the unexpectedly large decline in U.S. energy- related investment mentioned above. The situation for oil importers in the emerging and developing world is varied. These countries typically have more limited pass-through from international to domestic fuel prices compared with advanced economies; some have reduced fuel subsidies. True, governments' improved fiscal positions should eventually result in lower taxes or increased public spending, but the process could take time and is subject to various frictions and leakages. Overall, domestic demand growth for these oil importers was broadly in line with expectations'despite difficult macroeconomic conditions in a few countries that are exporters of other commodities. **Surprising macroeconomics at the zero interest-rate bound** There is another factor potentially impeding a pickup of demand in oil importers. Compared with previous price cycles, falling oil prices this time coincide with a period of slow economic growth'so slow that the major central banks have little or no capacity to lower their monetary policy interest rates further to support growth and combat deflationary pressures. Why does this matter? In the 1970s and 1980s, a large economics literature, summarized by [Michael Bruno and Jeffrey Sachs more than three decades ago, showed how oil-supply-driven price increases lead to stagflation'a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. Stagflation is a direct result of higher costs for producers who use energy, costs that lead them to reduce output, shed labor, and raise prices to cover higher costs. Even though oil is a less important production input than it was three decades ago, that reasoning should work in reverse when oil prices fall, leading to lower production costs, more hiring, and reduced inflation. But this channel causes a problem when central banks cannot lower interest rates. Because the policy interest rate cannot fall further, the decline in inflation (actual and expected) owing to lower production costs _raises_ the real rate of interest, compressing demand and very possibly stifling any increase in output and employment. Indeed, those aggregates may both actually _fall_. Something like this may be going on at the present time in some economies. Chart 3 is suggestive of a depressing effect of low expected oil prices on expected inflation: it shows the strong recent direct relationship between U.S. oil futures prices and a market-based measure of long-term inflation expectations. [ Being near the zero bound also can imply a 'perverse'\u009d response to higher oil prices. When central banks are battling deflation pressures, they are unlikely to raise policy interest rates aggressively to counter an uptick in inflation. As a result, oil price increases, symmetrically, can be expansionary by lowering the real interest rate. Of course, it would be wrong to conclude that central banks can enhance the benefits of current low oil prices by raising their policy interest rates. On the contrary, all else equal, that action would _harm_ growth by raising real interest rates. Our claim is simply that when an oil importer's macroeconomic conditions warrant a very low central bank interest rate, a fall in oil prices could move the real interest rate in a way that runs counter to the positive income effect. **The way forward** Persistently low oil prices complicate the conduct of monetary policy, risking further inroads by unanchored inflation expectations. What is more, the current episode of historically low oil prices could ignite a variety of dislocations including corporate and sovereign defaults, dislocations that can feed back into already jittery financial markets. The possibility of such negative feedback loops makes demand support by the global community'along with a range of country-specific structural and financial-sector reforms'all the more urgent.

How can it be that water is free even though life cannot exist without it, while diamonds are expensive although no one dies for lack of diamonds? The answer is that water can be free if its supply is abundant relative to demand. Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that worldwide, the demand for water outpaces supply. This imbalance is the clearest sign that water is underpriced. Yet, many governments are reluctant to price water like other goods. In a [recent study, we have examined whether this is the right choice. Do governments succeed in protecting their citizens by providing cheap water? On this World Water Day, let me take a closer look at that question. **Role for price incentives** In fact, when you do not get prices right for water, you end up with misallocation of water today and misallocation tomorrow. Misallocation today can take the form of thirst, low agricultural productivity, or worse, poor sanitation, disease, and malnourishment. Misallocation tomorrow can take the form of inadequate investment in infrastructure and the technologies to meet future water needs and ensure water security. All these are important enough to lead to macroeconomic and growth underperformance in economies. The need to 'get prices right'\u009d can be seen from country experiences around the globe. Take the case of India, where underpricing of water and inputs is contributing to scarcity today and long- term problems that will be hard to solve. Water-related subsidies'through lower prices of diesel and free electricity for irrigation pumps'have led to widespread overuse of underground aquifers and increased salinity of soils, nearly undoing all the productivity gains from the green revolution of the 1960s. Or California, where Governor Jerry Brown implemented an executive order in mid-2014 mandating a 25 percent reduction in water use over the next 12 months compared with 2013 levels. There were many reasons for the severe shortage of water in California, including severe droughts and unprecedentedly high temperatures, but decades of mispricing also played a role. This experience drives home the fact there is a strong role for price incentives in the rationalization of water use. There are numerous other examples from around the world that show that mispriced water leads to what is known as the 'tragedy of the commons,'\u009d where individual users of a resource acting independently and rationally according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource. This is evidenced by rapid depletion of underground aquifers and a deterioration in water quality. **Tip of the iceberg** In many countries, public water utilities charge households a price that is just a fraction of what it costs to deliver water, let alone maintain or expand water infrastructure. Calculations by IMF economists suggest that, in 2012, this underpricing resulted in water subsidies totaling about $456 billion worldwide, or about 0.6 percent of global GDP. In some countries subsidies amount to as much as 5 percent of GDP. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, as these estimates exclude agricultural uses of water, which in developing countries constitute the bulk of water consumption. Water subsidies even exceed total spending on public investment in some countries (see Chart 1)'suggesting that other worthwhile expenditures are being crowded out. [ If not charging for water helped the poor, water subsidies might be defensible. But our study finds that water subsidies are inequitable and do not achieve their declared goal. Since the subsidy that one gets is proportional to the water one uses, and since the poor often have limited or no access to water, subsidies in developing countries end up benefiting mostly upper-income groups. In select low-income economies, the richest households get, on average, three dollars' worth of subsidized water for every dollar's worth provided to the poorest (see Chart 2). [ **Price it right, use it wisely** So what is the answer? Achieving greater efficiency in water consumption requires a holistic approach complemented by the reform of policies that drive'directly or indirectly'water use. Governments could put in place regulations that strengthen rights to water access and promote its efficient use, build strong and independent institutions in charge of water management, and conduct public awareness campaigns that help build support for these reforms. Water pricing reform should be an essential component of any drive to improve water management, helping to rationalize demand, improve its delivery, and unlock further supply. Governments need to price water in a way that achieves full cost recovery, including costs of maintenance and investment. They should also design pricing in such a way as to expand water access for the poor and vulnerable. Take, for example, the case of Burkina Faso. The country introduced a progressive tariff grid for drinking water based on the volume of use, with the higher-tier users subsidizing the lowest tier as well as sanitation activities. The public water utility boasts recovery rates of 97 percent, has low debt ratios, and reaps annual profits. Thanks to water pricing reform, access to drinking water has doubled over the past two decades'a remarkable achievement in a country where water is scarce and rainfall highly variable. Why does the IMF care? It is clear that water challenges can have economic consequences, and failure to manage these well can impede a country's economic prospects. We hope that by studying the economic dimension of the issue, we can shine a light on this important topic. As we have seen with California's struggles, postponing action is a luxury the world can hardly afford. For more information, see [water infographic, and _Finance &amp; Development_ [article.

What to do? **Housing headache** The latest national data on house prices in February suggest a year-on-year increase of 9 percent. House prices in Vancouver and Toronto'that contribute about a third of Canada's GDP'have led the increase. Canada's housing boom has been accompanied by a steady rise in the nation's household debt to 165 percent of disposable income by the end of 2015 (see chart). One way to cool the housing sector is to increase interest rates, but that would hurt the slowing economy, which has been hit hard by the decline in oil prices. Hence, the dilemma. [ Low mortgage rates are an important factor feeding the housing market boom. This has helped keep interest payments low even as the size of the average mortgage has risen. As the figure shows, the share of interest payments in households' disposable income has declined from 9 percent in 2008 to 6 percent in 2015, while the average size of mortgages has increased by some 40 percent over the same period. This means more households are able to afford more expensive homes, which, in turn, prompts households to borrow more money and get further into debt, while house prices continue to be pushed upward. This process should continue as long as employment is robust and interest rates remain low. The Bank of Canada is rightly concerned about the rise in household debt, which makes the economy more vulnerable to unanticipated shocks and financial strains more probable. A mini version of this is playing out in Alberta, which has the third highest level of household debt among the provinces'after British Colombia and Ontario'and was hit by a large terms of trade shock from the oil price decline. The Alberta economy is expected to have contracted by almost 2 percent last year amid massive layoffs by the oil industry and house prices fell by 4 percent since their peak in late 2014. A solution would be to raise interest rates to cool the housing market. But it is not as simple as that. Tightening monetary policy could further weaken the Canadian economy that has already suffered a traumatic oil price shock. Greater wealth that comes with higher home values encourages households to spend, generating income for businesses and new opportunities for venture companies. Indeed, the strength of private consumption was instrumental in offsetting the sharp decline in business investment in the resources sector and helped the economy grow by 1.2 percent in 2015, following a recession in the first half of the year. **The right call** A new [paper by [Andrea Pescatori and [Stefan Laseen supports the Bank of Canada's decision to cut the policy interest rate in response to the collapse in oil prices early last year. The authors found it unlikely that the benefits of having a tighter monetary policy would outweigh the costs when the economy is weak. Benefits in reducing household debt accrue slowly over time, peaking 8 years after the monetary policy action, while costs in the form of higher unemployment are paid upfront within the first two years. It would only pay to 'lean against the wind'\u009d'raising interest rates beyond the level necessary to maintain price stability to limit the buildup in asset prices'if credit grows excessively fast (more than 9 percent annually) and the cost of a financial crisis is severe. To be sure, there is considerable uncertainty around these estimates. But they are not too far off from the Bank of Canada's own estimates. Compared with the [Bank of Canada, the authors find that the same amount of monetary policy contraction (100 basis points) have a smaller effect in reducing household debt (by 1.25 percent versus 2 percent after 5 years) but also in reducing GDP growth (by 0.75 percentage point versus 1 percentage point). There is much still to understand about the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability risks. Pescatori and Laseen's paper is an important contribution of a long process to examine this relationship based on empirical evidence and rigorous analysis. For the time being, the Bank of Canada is following a sensible risk management approach, using judgment in weighing financial stability considerations in its conduct of monetary policy. While monetary policy is the focus of the blog and the working paper, macroprudential policies and measures are also an important part of the tool kit, and should be the first line of defense in addressing financial stability risks. The IMF will continue to provide its assessment on the effectiveness of macroprudential measures in Canada, and a discussion of this topic goes beyond the scope of the working paper and the blog.

Everybody agrees: wages need to grow if Japan is to make a [definite escape from deflation. Full- time wages have increased by a mere 0.3 percent since 1995! For example, despite its record profits, Toyota increased its base salary only by 1.1 percent last year. The average of 219 Keidanren firms managed just 0.44 percent. Clearly, an increase in base wages, colloquially referred to as 'base up'\u009d, is long overdue. For quite some time now, Japanese authorities have attempted to reinvigorate growth and generate more inflation. This is important because debt can become quite burdensome when prices and incomes fail to grow. This is exactly what has been happening in Japan during the couple of decades of deflation. Nominal GDP fell throughout most of the period while public debt rose to nearly two and a half times the country's GDP, the highest debt in the world. **The dual labor market limits wage growth** [Our analytical work shows that lack of wage growth may have some structural causes that in turn contributed to secular deflation. First, most workers are employed under life-time contracts and hardly move jobs between companies. In exchange for life time employment, employees accept to temper wage demands, which means that tight labor markets do not translate into higher wages. In addition, a large share of workers (37 percent) are employed under non-regular contracts, a much higher share than in comparable economies. Companies scrambled to restore competitiveness after the sharp appreciation of the yen in the 1980s by moving production offshore and hiring nearly exclusively under much lower paid non- regular wage contracts. And at the same time, unionization declined and wage bargaining power of labor unions all but disappeared. **The tighter job market does not do it** Abenomics'a combination of monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms'was designed to boost both real growth and inflation. In 2013, the monetary arrow was launched in force, depreciating the yen and boosting corporate profits in the process. The ensuing record corporate profits were expected to be passed through to increased prices for subcontractors, dividends, and higher wages for all workers. It has helped in stirring nominal GDP. Over the past two years, nominal GDP has risen by 3.7 percent. Tax revenues especially from corporate profits have also increased. And the labor market has continued to tighten and participation reached a historic high. By end 2015, only 3.3 percent of people looking for jobs were unemployed. Some sectors are facing, acute labor shortages. Yet the current wage negotiations are hardly aggressive at all. For instance, Toyota's union is asking for only half as much as in 2015. Overall wage demands are likely to lead to an increase of only about 0.5 percent, well below the Bank of Japan's inflation target, ignoring any productivity improvements. The lagging of real wages to labor productivity appears to continue a long standing trend which has been affecting Japan more than other similar economies (see chart). [ True, the global and the domestic outlook remains weak. Corporations are not keen to boost wages or prices. Yet, wage and price inflation need not lead to loss in competitiveness or profitability. For instance, if inflation was at two percent and productivity grew by one percent, then increases in wages and social security benefits by 3 percent would leave everyone equally well off. And collectively the economy would benefit from lower real interest rates and more effective monetary policy. **Wage increases could be the missing arrow** Abenomics rightly aimed to end Japan's entrenched deflationary mentality. The monetary arrow was meant to raise inflation expectations to 2 percent, and thus provide a mechanism to coordinate wage and price inflation. However, this has proven to be a hard struggle because companies and workers alike seem to look backward rather than forward in setting their expectations. As a result, they fail to do their part to solve the coordination problem that would leave all better off. More recently, Prime Minister Abe has shown leadership by increasing minimum wages. But this affects directly only about one tenth of the work force. The impact is limited at best. We are not sure that relying on moral suasion for the rest will deliver results. Rather, a fourth arrow needs to be loaded: * The government could replicate the success of the corporate governance reform by introducing a 'comply or explain'\u009d mechanism for profitable companies to ensure that they raise wages by at least 2 percent plus productivity growth. * The authorities could strengthen existing tax incentives to raise wages. * Policymakers could even go a step further by introducing tax penalties for companies not passing on excessive profit growth. * Another option is to set the example by raising public sector wages in a forward looking manner. At the same time, these steps would be reinforced by the existing arrows. In particular, Prime Minister Abe's third arrow needs to cut much deeper through labor market duality by ensuring that new hiring takes place on contracts that strike a middle ground between the currently prevailing life-time and non- regular contracts. This would restore some healthy wage bargaining power to workers. Along the way, 'base-up'\u009d should again become a household word.

It reached 10'11 percent by 2008, and remained elevated at double digits for several years. Even though inflation fell by almost half in 2014, inflation expectations have remained high. High and persistent inflation in recent years has presented serious macroeconomic challenges in India, increasing the country's domestic and external vulnerabilities. As Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan pointed out at the 8th R.N. Kao Memorial Lecture in 2014, 'inflation is a destructive disease '\u00a6 we can't push inflation under the carpet as a central banker. We have to deal with it.'\u009d Hence, this [book'which grew out of the IMF staff's ongoing policy dialogue with the Indian authorities'analyzes various facets of Indian inflation, particularly food inflation, and their implications for the conduct of monetary policy. The book (Parts 1 and II) looks at the causes and consequences of inflation in India and concludes: * Unlike advanced economies, food inflation in emerging markets (including India) is more volatile and persistent. Food inflation developments in India over the past decade appear to largely reflect demand pressures (driven by strong private consumption growth), which have often outpaced supply of key food commodities. * Inflation has costs'it hurts growth and worsens inequality. There is an inflation-growth threshold effect in the Indian states with persistently elevated consumer price index inflation rates of over 5\u00c2? percent. Higher non-food inflation is also associated with worsening income inequality in both urban and rural areas. * Inflation dynamics in both Nepal and Bhutan are closely linked to those in India. These finding have important policy implications, which are covered in Part III of the book: * **Food inflation developments matter. **The share of food expenditure is high in total household expenditure, and food inflation informs inflation expectations and wages. In fact, as the second-round effects of food inflation are large in India, monetary policy will need to respond to rather large and persistent food price shocks. Analysis suggests that responding to headline inflation rather than core inflation is welfare superior, and is often better to mitigate consumption and output fluctuations. * Sustaining the long-term inflation target of 4 percent under India's recently adopted flexible inflation targeting framework will depends on **enhancing food supply, agricultural market-based pricing, and reducing price distortions. **In the absence of a stronger food supply growth response, food inflation may exceed nonfood inflation by 2\u00c2?'3 percentage points per year. * Given high costs of inflation, the Reserve Bank of India needs to **balance the short-term growth-inflation trade-off,** in light of the long-term negative effects on growth of persistently high inflation. Chapter 4 of the book is a particularly interesting read, where micro level data (household survey data) has been used to investigate the demand and supply factors underpinning relative food price inflation. Further, it analyzes non-monetary factors responsible for relative food price inflation. The chapter also offers policy advice for achieving inflation targets under India's recently adopted flexible inflation targeting framework.

It is a time to celebrate the impressive progress women at all levels of the career ladder have made in recent decades. More women in the labor force, and in more senior positions is good news for women, for their companies, and for their countries' economies. A new IMF staff [study finds that in Europe, national policies, even taking account of personal preferences, can boost women's participation in the workforce and enhance their chances for advancement. The research, which looked at 2 million firms in 34 countries in Europe, also finds that the more women in senior managerial positions and in corporate boards, the more profitable firms are. One more woman in senior management or on a corporate board is associated with 8'13 basis points higher return on assets. High corporate profitability could support investment and productivity'another channel through which more women in the workforce can help mitigate Europe's potential growth slowdown. The results are clear: increasing female participation improves the bottom line. **More working women** In regions like Europe, where populations are aging, the working-age population is being squeezed, and productivity growth is declining, there is more incentive than ever to level the playing field for women to work full- time and climb higher up the ladder. Over the past three decades, millions of women in Europe have joined the labor force. Countries such as Spain and Ireland have seen the share of women who work outside the household double since the 1980s'from under 40 percent to more than 80 percent in the case of Spain. In several Nordic and Eastern European countries, women today are almost as likely to work for pay as men are. At the same time, legal requirements for [gender diversity in corporate boardrooms have helped boost women's representation in top decision- making positions'women now hold almost a quarter of senior management or board positions in the corporate sector. Still, there is scope to bring more women into the labor force. In almost all European countries, women are significantly less active in the labor market than men. Even those women who are employed often work less than full-time. Although women today make up almost half the European labor force aged 25-54, their representation on the top rungs of the corporate ladder is significantly below that of men. [ **Policies matter** Clearly, women's personal **preferences** and attitudes toward working are important determinants of their decision to join the labor force, as our staff's research confirms. This is especially true in Europe, where women today face no legal restrictions to employment, are just as educated as men, and have fewer children'and social norms have changed. But the study finds that **policies** also have an important influence on women's employment decisions, even after accounting for individual characteristics, choices, and preferences about working. Removing tax disincentives for the second earner in a family, providing sufficient childcare services, and allowing parental leave can broaden the opportunity for women to work as much as they want. **The whole economy benefits** It is not only women who may benefit economically from working. Bringing more women into the labor force benefits a country's economy in two important ways: * First, more women in the labor force will expand labor supply. If women choose to participate in the labor market as much as men do, Europe's workforce could increase by 6 percent. If they also choose to work as many hours as men, the workforce could grow by as much as 15 percent. * Second, the prevalence of full-time female employment is a strong predictor of the share of senior corporate positions held by women. And more women in senior managerial positions and in corporate boardrooms, the IMF staff study confirms, is associated with stronger firm financial performance, which would help support corporate investment and productivity, further mitigating the slowdown in potential growth in Europe. [ The positive relationship between more women high on the corporate ladder and firms' profitability is more pronounced, the study finds, in sectors where women form a larger share of the labor force'highlighting the importance of bridging gender gaps between senior executives and the general workforce. This positive association is also more evident in knowledge-intensive services and high-tech manufacturing sectors'where diversity, including gender diversity, can help meet the high demand for creativity and innovative capacity. As we celebrate women's achievements in Europe's labor force, we must also acknowledge that the journey is still in train. The potential benefits can be large. We must not miss this opportunity.

Larger buffers give bankers 'skin in the game'\u009d helping to prevent excessive risk taking and absorb losses during crises. But, some argue, they might increase the cost of financial intermediation and slow economic growth. In a recent [paper, we look at past banking crises and find that had banks had sufficient buffers to absorb losses in the range of 15 to 23 percent of risk-weighted assets, most of these crises would have been avoided (at least for advanced economies). This finding is broadly consistent with recent recommendations on total loss absorption capacity by the [Financial Stability Board. We also review evidence on the costs of holding larger loss absorption buffers and higher capital in particular. We find that most estimates suggest that while these costs tend to be limited in the long run (once banks have adapted to a new regulatory regime), they can be much larger during the transition to higher standards. Any new regulatory minima should therefore be imposed gradually, when conditions allow, and over a relatively long period of time. **Bank loss absorption during crises ** In our study, we take two approaches. In the first, we focus on bank losses in past banking crises and ask **how much of a buffer it would have taken to absorb them fully through equity** (that is without imposing haircuts on bank bondholders or depositors). We look at available data on non-performing loans (NPLs) and the impact of bank losses on capital. We find that for advanced economies, the level of risk weighted capital that would have enabled banks to absorb losses in 85 percent of crises ranges from 15 to 23 percent. The marginal benefits of additional capital decline sharply past that level (at least from a loss absorption point of view). In the second approach, we consider **how much bank capital would have been needed to avoid public recapitalizations during the 2007-2013 crises**. The results of this exercise are broadly consistent with those based on NPLs. We find that the marginal benefit of additional capital in terms of avoiding public recapitalization episodes is relatively high until risk-weighted capital ratios in the 15 to 17 percent range (which help avoid public recapitalizations in 75 percent of banking crises). But it drops once that level is reached. A similar bank-level analysis using data on European and U.S banks suggests that a capital of 15 percent in 2007 would have avoided the need for capital injection in almost 55 percent of cases in the U.S. and 75 percent of cases in Europe (based on a sample of available data), while a capital of 23 percent would have eliminated the need for injection in virtually all cases. **The costs of capital buffers** Our study also reviews the growing literature on the costs of bank capital. When thinking about these costs, it is important to distinguish those incurred during the transition to higher levels of capital (transition costs) from the long-term costs (or steady-state costs) associated with a heavier reliance on equity going forward. The literature finds that long-term costs are small but that transition costs might be significantly higher. In particular, evidence suggests that, during the transition, bank credit grows at a noticeably slower pace. These costs can however be reduced by giving banks ample time to adjust their capital ratios. Therefore, the pace of the transition is an important policy lever. **Other considerations** Our study carries some caveats, however. In particular, from a regulatory standpoint, appropriate capital requirements may be below our suggested range, as banks tend to hold capital in excess of regulatory minima and other bail-in instruments can contribute to loss-absorption capacity. In addition, our approach does not take into account that more capital would likely make banks more prudent in lending (bank owners/managers would have 'skin in the game'\u009d). We also suggest above the need for new regulatory minima to be imposed over a relatively long period of time. In particular, timing can be critical since experience shows that markets may pressure banks to anticipate full compliance with new standards, irrespective of regulatory timelines. Also, supervisors should encourage banks to increase loss absorption by raising equity (through new issuance or retained earnings) rather than shrinking assets, so as to avoid reduced credit availability. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that there is more to capital than loss absorption and there is also more to crisis prevention than improved capital buffers. Our paper focuses on bank capital and loss absorption capacity, but a host of regulatory steps can enhance financial stability including the choice of the regulatory perimeter to address the risks stemming from the shadow banking sector. Further, we have not considered institutional factors that can create room for significant variations across jurisdictions.

The meeting comes at a critical time for the global economy. A note by IMF staff prepared as background for the G20 meeting_, __[Global Prospects and Policy Challenges__, _points to a tepid recovery, and warns that weaker global growth might well be in the cards. This calls for a strong policy response, both national and multilateral, including from the G20. Why weaker growth? The _[G20 Surveillance Note_ (_G20 Note_) cites a variety of factors at work: concerns about the global impact of China's transition to more balanced growth; signs of distress in other large emerging markets, including from falling commodity prices; and a rise in global risk aversion, leading to substantial declines in equity markets. There is more. Further shocks of a non-economic origin'related to geopolitical conflicts, [refugees, terrorism and global epidemics'could also have significant impact on economic activity. What to do about the increasing risks to the recovery is perhaps the single most important question before the finance chiefs in Shanghai. Here the _G20 Note _is very clear: There is less room for complacency now. Policymakers can and should act quickly to boost growth and plan to contain risks. How? Well, the policy mix matters. For many countries, the IMF calls for a mix of demand support and structural reform. If done right, these policies will re-enforce each other and create stronger and more sustainable growth. Another important point is the recognition that accommodative monetary policy, while still very much needed, cannot do it alone. There needs to be a comprehensive approach, including fiscal policy (where there is fiscal space) and balance sheet repair. Where feasible, emerging market commodity exporters impacted by lower commodity prices should make use of fiscal buffers and let their exchange rate help with the adjustment. Coordinating a strong policy response at the G20 level is just as urgent. The G20 must plan now and proactively identify policies that could be rolled out quickly, if downside risks materialize. The _G20 Note _also recommends other collective efforts, such as enhancing the global financial safety net and ring-fencing spillovers from non-economic shocks.

Presbitero and [Min Zhu ( Many low-income developing countries have joined the group of Eurobond issuers across the globe' in sub-Saharan Africa (for example, Senegal, Zambia, and Ghana), Asia (for example, Mongolia) and elsewhere, raising over US$21 billion cumulatively over the past decade. Tapping these markets provides a new source of funds, but also exposes borrowers to shifts in investor sentiment and rising global interest rates. We examined the experience of low-income developing countries with capital inflows in the last decade and a half [in a recent report. We found that capital inflows have increased sharply since 2004, in two distinct waves: a first surge from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2004 to 6.9 percent in 2007, and, after a temporary dip during the global financial crisis, a strong rebound, reaching 6.3 percent of GDP in 2012 (Chart 1). The steady increase in private capital inflows in the 2000s'together with improved growth prospects and domestic economic conditions'highlights a key shift in the financing from official sources to international capital markets for this group of countries. Private capital flows in 2012 were larger than either aid or remittance inflows, which amounted to 3.5 and 5.2 percent of GDP respectively. [ The composition of inflows has also been changing over time: while inflows consisted primarily of foreign direct investment in the early 2000s, the post- global crisis period has seen an acceleration in portfolio debt and equity inflows, as well as other inflows to the non-official sector, such as cross- border bank lending. A handful of countries have driven the uptick in these inflows. These represent the fast-growing [frontier economies that have, in the main, opened their capital account at a faster pace than other low-income countries. Many are now as open as emerging markets, and [receive inflows comparable to the levels attracted by emerging markets (Chart 2). * Sovereign bonds issued by low-income countries amounted to US$4 billion in 2013 and to US$8 billion in 2014, thanks in part to issuances by C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia. In 2015, with weaker global conditions and falling commodity prices, the number of issuances declined and those who issued new bonds had to pay significantly higher yields. * A sizeable increase in cross-border bank syndicated loans boosted the rise in other inflows, particularly after the crisis. These loans amounted to more than US$73 billion over the period 2000'2014, and for some countries, were large in relation to the size of GDP. [ **The pluses and minuses of capital inflows** Capital inflows are an important source of external funding for developing countries that can stimulate investment and promote financial deepening in many countries. And, as [our report documents, the recent increase in capital inflows (other than foreign direct investment) to many low-income countries has been associated with a rise in public investment. However, higher capital inflows have also funded higher public consumption. Specifically, in several other countries that recently issued sovereign bonds, including Ghana, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Zambia'on average'portfolio debt issuances have coincided not only with increases in public investment but also public consumption. In this context, one cautionary note is that if countries do not use inflows productively to increase economic potential, they will face a significant future debt service burden that will weigh on income levels. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that increased financial integration makes countries more exposed to shocks from outside their borders, as discussed in a [previous post. Capital inflows can be volatile and susceptible to changes in global conditions'such as swings in commodity prices and exchange rates. There are currently three main external risks to the scale of capital inflows: the gradual increase in global interest rates, the retreat in commodity prices, and the rebalancing of the Chinese economy. And, both the levels and costs (for example [bond spreads) of capital flows are responsive to global economic and financial conditions. The market turbulence that followed the announcement made by the Federal Reserve in May 2013 about the possibility of tapering its bond purchases sooner than previously expected reverberated not only on [exchange rates and bond prices in emerging markets, but also on sovereign bond spreads in frontier economies (Chart 3). [ However, domestic economic factors matter as well'for example, as our analysis shows that the price of new external funding tends to rise with higher current account and fiscal deficits, higher public debt, and lower foreign reserves. Our analysis of recent economic developments and prospects in [_low-income and developing countries_ highlights a few policy messages for countries: 1. First, domestic economic policies do matter. The level and terms at which countries receive external financing responds to both external and domestic economic conditions. This includes solid fiscal and external balances, sustainable debt levels and strong foreign reserves. 2. As a corollary however, this also means that countries where domestic economic policy management has been weak or is slipping are likely to experience a sharp retrenchment in terms of access and/or pricing of external financing. This may require significant changes to fiscal policies and investment plans. 3. Last but not least, countries need to recognize the double-edged nature of capital inflows when considering the pace and sequencing of their efforts to liberalize their capital accounts. Also, countries need to make effective use of the external private financing to increase economic potential through productive investment, while building economic resilience to handle additional financial volatility and associated risks. This underscores the importance of maintaining strong economic policies and building public debt management capacity.

Thomsen Having successfully pulled Greece from the brink last summer and subsequently stabilized the economy, the government of Alexis Tsipras is now discussing with its European partners and the IMF a comprehensive multi-year program that can secure a lasting recovery and make debt sustainable. While discussions continue, there have been some misperceptions about the International Monetary Fund's views and role in the process. I thought it would be useful to clarify issues. It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece's next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief'we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief. This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece's debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece's pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable'one that adds up. Such difficult decisions cannot be 'kicked down the road'\u009d through unrealistic assumptions. While there is much scope for increasing productivity through reforms, the past six years have shown that the scope and pace of reforms acceptable to the Greek society is not commensurate with an early improvement of productivity and sustained high growth. Thus, assuming that Greece can simply grow out of its debt problem without debt relief'by rapidly transitioning from the lowest to the highest productivity growth within the euro zone'is not credible. Similarly, the very limited success in combating Greece's notorious tax evasion'to make the well-off pay their fair share'means that pension reforms cannot be avoided by simply assuming higher tax collections in the future. Why the focus on pension reforms? Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece's pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany'measured by the average wage'is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00c2? percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable. But can't Greece protect pensioners by cutting somewhere else or increasing tax rates? There is some scope for those measures, but it is very limited. Most other spending has already been cut to the bone in an effort to protect pensions and social payments, while the failure to broaden the base and improve compliance has already caused too much reliance on high tax rates. To reach its ambitious medium-term target for the primary surplus of 3\u00c2? percent of GDP, Greece will need to take measures in the order of some 4-5 percent of GDP. We cannot see how Greece can do so without major savings on pensions. Pension reforms will of course be socially challenging for the Greek people, which have seen exceptional hardship in recent years. In fact, social pressures have already forced reversals of course'under both the previous and the current government'and Greece is unfortunately much further away from its medium-term goals than it was in mid-2014, before a major fiscal relaxation erased what proved to be only a temporary primary surplus. In this regard, the government is right to point out that pensions in Greece have a broader social function. But using pensions in this way is not a durable solution. What is needed'and what the IMF has argued for'is a modern social safety net that is sustainable over the medium term. Could a primary surplus target well below 3\u00c2? percent of GDP make the necessary pension reform less demanding? Perhaps, but that would necessitate more debt relief. This is understandably controversial among Greece's European partners, in part because several of them are required to run similarly high surpluses to preserve debt sustainability, and in part because some of the countries that would be in effect paying for debt relief to Greece are poorer than Greece, paying much less generous pensions to their own people. With the euro zone still far from being a political union, a compromise will need to reflect such political constraints. The IMF is willing to work with the combination of reforms and debt relief on which Greece and its European partners can agree. But again, it needs to add up. The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term. We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government's plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece's revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate. The overriding objective of the IMF's engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece's efforts over the last six years are not wasted.

And not always good ones. Often times, debt increases significantly because an unforeseen obligation materializes. These contingent liabilities, as they are known in the economist's jargon, can have significant economic and fiscal costs. In fact, on many occasions, large and unexpected increases in debt across the world were due to the materialization of [contingent liabilities. That is why they are often called hidden deficits. To gain a better understanding of these liabilities, we have created in a recent [paper, a new dataset documenting over 200 episodes (covering 80 countries over the period 1990'2014), involving the materialization of contingent liabilities. **How it works** Simply put, a contingent fiscal liability is a potential obligation for the government, which depends on a possible future event. Here is how it works. If a government provides a guarantee for a public or private company's loan and the company fails to make payments, the lender will call the guarantee. Consequence: the government will have to take the loan on its books. These liabilities can be embedded into explicit contracts like a loan guarantee, but they can also be implicit. For example, governments are often expected to cover the debts of local authorities or state-owned enterprises when these are unable to pay. Sometimes, governments also incur substantial costs from financial sector bailouts. Countries like Australia and the United Kingdom, record, monitor, disclose, and manage these potential liabilities to minimize risks to their budgets. However, in most cases, taxpayers only know about them when it's too late. That is, when these liabilities are no longer 'potential'\u009d but 'actual.'\u009d **Costly deficits** The key finding is that the fiscal cost of these liabilities is large. The cost averages 6 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and in some cases exceeds 20 percent of GDP (see chart). Given that it happens every 12 years in the average country, potential cost is about half percent of GDP per year. However, this average masks important differences between countries. Not all countries are equally likely to experience these costs. For example, in Brazil, it happened on average every 5'6 years and cost 8.3 percent of GDP. The incidence was much lower in countries like Canada, Hong Kong and Israel. [ Digging deeper, we also find that support to the financial sector, including bailouts, accounts for the largest share of these unexpected costs. Think of Indonesia, Thailand and Korea during the Asian Crisis. Or, think Iceland and Ireland during the recent global financial crisis. Subnational government bailouts, support to state-owned enterprises and legal liabilities also give rise to substantial costs (see table). Examples of these include Argentina (2001'2004), Greece (2007'2010) and Macedonia (starting in 1999). [ Additionally, our analysis also shows that liabilities tend to materialize after periods of high growth and coincide with low growth periods and banking crises. And, they tend to happen at the same time, putting considerable strain on government finances. When it rains, it pours. The Asian Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis are prime examples. We have also learned that countries with stronger institutions and lower growth volatility tend to suffer less from contingent liability realizations. Indeed, countries with strong public institutions could face a cost which is 30 percent lower than the average. **Avoiding bad surprises** What are the lessons for policymakers? * First, countries must build strong institutions to avoid the emergence of these liabilities. It means better governance at the local government level, in state owned-enterprises, and public-private partnerships. It also means stronger supervision and better resolution regimes for financial sector institutions to avoid the taxpayer having to pay for financial sector bailouts, the most costly source of liabilities. * Second, governments need to put in place more transparent and better arrangements for disclosing and monitoring their hidden liabilities. In particular, fiscal frameworks should be strengthened to enhance discipline and limit the excessive growth of contingent liabilities. This is particularly important because the evidence shows that these hidden deficits tend to emerge in times of financial distress when public finances are the weakest. Needless to say that it is better to avoid bad surprises in the budget during these difficult times.

The collapse of housing bubbles can be very costly. * In Japan, house prices rose by about 40 percent during the mid-1980s; the collapse was followed by a 'lost decade' in which incomes did not grow and house prices fell by over 40 percent. * In the United States, house prices increased by about 30 percent between 2001 and 2006; their collapse was followed by the global financial crisis. The collapse of the housing sector can often lead to a broader collapse of the financial sector. And the cost to the government of cleaning up the mess can be very high. For several years, analysts have been expressing concerns about China's housing market. Despite some reversals, house prices in China have continued their long upward march over the past decade (Chart 1), prompting questions about what the future holds. At a [conference last month in Shenzhen, leading analysts of China's housing markets provided some answers. Organized by the IMF in cooperation with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Princeton University, the conference spotlighted new data sets on China's housing markets painstakingly assembled by leading experts. **The bottom line:** The steady increase in China's house prices at the national level masks tremendous variation at the city level. **The findings from these leading experts:** It's supply and demand. First: there is substantial heterogeneity across cities in the balance between housing supply and demand. At one end, housing supply has outpaced demand in the interior part of the country. On the other end, housing demand has outpaced supply in most major eastern markets, such as Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Second, markets such as Beijing, despite their strong measured fundamentals, should be considered somewhat risky because homes there trade at very high multiples of rent.

Against this background, it's a good time to look back at the region's recent growth experience and examine the relationship between growth rates and competitiveness. The extent to which sub-Saharan African companies are able to compete against their foreign competitors (that is, the extent to which they are competitive) could indeed play a role in sustaining growth going ahead. Sub-Saharan Africa's rapid growth in recent years has been one of the success stories of the global economy. This growth has been broad-based: two-thirds of the countries have enjoyed more than ten years of sustained growth; a quarter, more than 20 years of uninterrupted growth. This has been accompanied by a decline in poverty, while life expectancy, maternal and infant mortality rates have improved. **Growth's soft underbelly** But the growth experience has also had a soft underbelly. In the vast majority of countries, with growth, came the deterioration in external current account deficits. To some extent, this has reflected the big investments (often with high import content) that countries have been making to address their infrastructure needs, efforts which should bear fruit moving forward. That said, the region's export performance over the last two decades has not been encouraging despite the high commodity prices that prevailed. The region's exports as a percentage of global trade have barely increased since the mid-1990s, and manufacturing exports in particular, have lagged well behind the rest of the world. What does this say about the region's competitiveness? This is a question that my colleagues sought to answer in our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook_. We approached the question from two angles: how the traditional indicators of competitiveness, like real effective exchange rates, have evolved, and the extent to which competitiveness has mattered for growth performance. **Traditional indicators: not a pretty picture ** Two main findings emerge from our analysis of competitiveness indicators: * After gaining competitiveness for a portion of the 1990s, many sub-Saharan African countries steadily lost ground. The competitiveness of commodity exporters especially, was severely eroded as their real effective exchange rates appreciated nearly 40 percent over 2002-14. * By 2014, price levels in many sub-Saharan African countries, most notably commodity exporters, were substantially higher than in a group of comparator low-income countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, and Vietnam) which have enjoyed success in recent years in diversifying their exports and integrating into global value chains. The lack of price competitiveness has been exacerbated by structural impediments'particularly weak institutions, the limited supply of skilled labor, and infrastructure gaps, making the region costly for producers. For example, in the most recent Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) compiled by the World Economic Forum, sub-Saharan African countries received some of the lowest scores in the world. An even greater concern is the limited improvement since the mid-2000s, with key bottlenecks persisting in infrastructure, technological readiness and the provision of health and education. That said, it is highly encouraging that the survey showed countries such as Mauritius, South Africa, Rwanda, Botswana, Namibia, Kenya and Seychelles, have GCI scores comparable to the average scores prevailing in other emerging and developing regions in the world, proving that the surge in infrastructure spending in recent years has paid off in lowering costs in several countries. Another interesting finding, and one that gave us pause, is how the increased participation in global trade of low-cost emerging and developing countries has actually intensified the level of competition. This shift in many instances, has partially or even fully offset the price reductions that countries in the region have been able to achieve. **Has it mattered for growth?** We then considered periods of sustained growth around the world to see the extent to which competitiveness has mattered for growth. Sustained growth is defined as periods of five or more years of consecutive annual real per capita growth in excess of 2 percent. They found that over the whole sample (1980-2014), sub-Saharan Africa experienced fewer growth spells than other regions, but the incidence of such episodes has increased substantially since 2000. More interesting still, in the period since 2000, there appears to have been two distinct types of sustained growth episodes in the region. In about half the countries, higher commodity prices and/or a rebound from conflict, seem to have played a strong role in fostering growth. However, in the other half or so cases, growth was accompanied by sustained competitiveness and even some diversification in exports in some countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda). **Policy implications** I see three important takeaways from all this: * The strong growth outcomes of recent years should not obscure the fact that competitiveness has deteriorated, particularly in many of the region's hard commodity exporters, and that strong policy action, both on the macroeconomic and structural fronts, is needed to restore competitiveness. * In the immediate near-term it is important to maintain economic stability'including, where there are flexible exchange rate regimes'by allowing the exchange rate to depreciate and absorb the impact of the shocks. * But medium-term structural reforms of the type that furthers trade liberalization, enhances skills in the labor market and improves institutions and infrastructure, are equally, if not more important, to achieve lasting improvements in competitiveness. As high commodity prices and abundant global liquidity are quickly fading, sub-Saharan Africa needs to restore competitiveness now to diversify its economies, sustain high rates of growth and create jobs for its burgeoning and young labor force, which is expected to increase dramatically just as the rest of the world starts ageing.

The [global recovery continues to struggle to gain its footing, with strains in some large emerging market economies weighing on growth prospects. For Latin America and the Caribbean, growth in 2016 is now expected to be negative for the second consecutive year'the first time since the debt crisis of 1982'83, which triggered the 'lost decade'\u009d for the region (see table). The regional recession, however, masks the fact that most countries continue to grow modestly but surely. In particular, country specific developments are being determined by the interplay between external shocks and domestic fundamentals. While countries with strong policy frameworks have been adjusting to external shocks smoothly, countries with weaker domestic fundamentals are experiencing significant downturns. The sizeable decline in commodity prices (about 30 to 50 percent relative to its peak depending on the country) has led to significant losses in export revenues (estimated at around $200 billion for the 7 listed economies). However, the sizes of the terms of trade shocks relative to the sizes of these economies (less than 1 percent of GDP for Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico in 2015 and 2016) are not enough to explain the severity of contraction in some cases. Indeed, our negative growth projection is driven by four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela), as the decline in commodity prices in combination with macroeconomic imbalances and microeconomic distortions has led to sharp declines in private investment (see chart). Overall, over the medium term, growth is expected to remain tepid, highlighting the importance of resolving domestic challenges. The regional outlook also hides important sub-regional differences. While South America is heavily affected by the decline in commodity prices, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean are beneficiaries of the strengthening U.S. economy and, in most cases, of the oil price decline. **South America** In **_Chile_, _Colombia_, **and** _Peru_**, a relatively orderly adjustment process continues, where a policy mix of large exchange rate depreciations, gradual fiscal consolidation, and accommodative monetary policies have staved off contraction. The foundations for growth remain in place, including sound policy frameworks, credible institutions, healthy financial markets, and favorable foreign borrowing costs. However, potential growth is expected to be lower given that the transition to more diverse sources of growth will likely take time. In **_Bolivia_**, growth also remains strong, but faces risks from rising public debt and the current account deficit. In **_Brazil_**, a combination of macroeconomic fragilities stemming from slow domestic adjustment, a wide-reaching scandal involving government and corporate officials, and political problems have paralyzed investment and dominated the economic outlook. Following a sharp contraction of 3.8 percent in 2015, output is expected to fall a further 3.5 percent in 2016'the largest total contraction since 1981'83. Unemployment has risen sharply, and inflation is in double digits. Political dysfunction continues to delay the adoption of a credible fiscal strategy to keep public debt on a sustainable path, which has prompted rating downgrades and increased financing costs. Although exports are now beginning to show signs of strength with the _real_ depreciating sharply, resolution of political and policy uncertainty is essential to an eventual return to positive growth. In **_Venezuela_**, longstanding policy distortions and fiscal imbalances were already having a deleterious effect on the economy before the collapse in oil prices. These problems worsened as falling oil prices triggered an economic crisis, with an expected fall in output of almost 18 percent over 2015 and 2016 (the third sharpest decline in the world). A lack of hard currency has led to scarcity of intermediate goods and to widespread shortages of essential goods'including food'exacting a tragic toll. Prices continue to spiral out of control, and we expect inflation to rise to 720 percent this year, from a world-high inflation of about 275 percent in 2015. In **_Argentina_**, the new government has started an important transition to correct macroeconomic imbalances and microeconomic distortions. Significant steps towards this transition have been taken by eliminating restrictions on the foreign exchange market, removing several constraints on international trade, and announcing the main guidelines of the macroeconomic framework, and the partial removal of energy subsidies. The new approach has improved prospects for growth in the medium term, but the adjustment is likely to generate a mild recession in 2016. In **_Ecuador_**, a smoother adjustment to falling oil prices is precluded by macroeconomic rigidities. With continued decline in oil prices and real exchange rate appreciation, we anticipate a recession this year. This also reflects fiscal consolidation measures in 2015 and 2016, tight financing conditions, and the dollarization regime which rules out a monetary policy response. **Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean** **_Mexico_** is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, supported by healthy private domestic demand and spillovers from a strong U.S. economy. The depreciation of the peso and lower electricity prices should boost manufacturing production and exports. The recent decline in oil prices will have only a limited effect on public finances in 2016 as oil price risk has been hedged for that year. However, if the oil price shock is persistent, it would increase the fiscal consolidation burden in the medium term. **_Central America and the Dominican Republic_** have benefited from the oil price decline, a stronger U.S. growth, and higher remittances, but the recent softening of world coffee and banana prices could reduce this impulse. While tourism-based **_Caribbean countries_** also benefit from the low energy costs and recovery in the U.S., declining prices for oil, gold, and alumina have worsened the outlook for commodity-intensive countries in the Caribbean. **What could go wrong?** The increase in U.S. interest rates last December had limited impact on U.S. and Latin American asset prices, confirming that markets had largely priced in the decision. Remaining risks are related to the expected path of interest rates, where uncertainty or sudden revisions could cause the term premium to increase'a source of substantial spillovers to long-term interest rates in the region. The region remains particularly vulnerable to a stronger-than-expected slowdown in China'a main trading partner for the region'and to further declines in commodity prices. Closer to home, a further deterioration of the situation in Brazil could lead to a sudden re-pricing of regional assets, as well as reduced demand for exports among trading partners in MERCOSUR. The recovery in investment could be delayed given high corporate leverage in the region. With medium-term growth expected to remain low, corporations may need to adjust their balance sheets, weakening prospects for private investment. **Policy priorities** Large depreciations have created tensions even for the region's most well- established inflation targeting central banks. As falling exchange rates raised domestic inflation, central banks held their fire and kept monetary conditions adequately loose to support weak domestic demand. But a continued deterioration of global commodity prices has made depreciations unprecedentedly persistent, causing inflation to remain above central bank targets for prolonged periods, except in Mexico. While clear communication has helped keep inflation expectations well anchored, recent upticks have led central banks to respond with modest rate hikes. With current accounts in deficit throughout the region, further external adjustment will likely be needed, putting further pressure on exchange rates and making the job of central banks challenging, particularly in the absence of aggregate demand pressures. In a global environment that is expected to remain subdued, we expect the region to grow at a slow pace for an extended period. 2016 will be a time for regional policymakers to err on the side of caution: adjustment should be allowed to continue and buffers should be preserved.

So what's new this time around? Virtual currencies are part of a broader tech revolution that is driving fundamental change in the global economy. While the money is virtual, the rewards and the risks are very real. It boils down to this: how best to encourage financial innovation while regulating to protect consumers and avoid other possible harm. A few of our economists, financial experts, and lawyers decided to tackle the issue in a [new paper with a global view. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's Managing Director also [spoke about virtual currencies in Davos today. Virtual currencies like Bitcoin (there are many others too), have gone from underground to over-hyped in a very short period of time. So far, they remain a relatively small part of the financial sector: $ 7 billion compared to the $1.4 trillion in U.S. currency in circulation. **The benefits:** more people may eventually gain access to financial services, many of them traditionally excluded from their country's financial system. Financial inclusion, in other words. Also, the distributed ledger technologies underlying virtual currencies have applications that go well beyond money and payments, and hold the promise of big gains in efficiency for many types of financial business. **The risks:** people using virtual currencies for money laundering, terrorist financing, as well as fraud, tax evasion, getting around capital controls, and people not understanding the risks they've taken on. **The solution:** regulations that limit the risks and encourage innovation. Still, a lot of work remains to be done to find the right approaches and the right balance. You won't be surprised to learn authors also find that international cooperation (part of the IMF's bread and butter) is key for countries to develop effective regulations. Interestingly, so far the risks to financial stability and monetary policy are minor, but this assessment may change as virtual currency use grows. The paper has something for everyone: policy advice, a useful country-by- country guide to virtual currency regulations, a primer on how distributed ledgers work, and a look back at the history of private money in a number of countries and how it worked out.

The fundamental forces that underlay our [October _World Economic Outlook_ projections have not dissipated, and in some respects have intensified, leading us to trim our expectations for future medium-term growth of the world economy. In the _[World Economic Outlook Update_ released today, we still, however, expect growth to pick up this year in most countries. Despite the modesty of the reduction we see in general [growth prospects and the promise of improvement in coming years, downside risks to our central scenario have intensified. In our view, a focus on these risks is the main factor driving recent developments in financial markets. We may be in for a bumpy ride this year, especially in the emerging and developing world. Fundamental to the current global conjuncture are the same three forces we highlighted in [October: China's slower growth and rising financial-market risks amid a process of macroeconomic rebalancing away from the traditional industrial and construction sectors; the fall in commodity prices, notably the price of [oil; and asynchronous trends in monetary policies, especially between the United States and most other advanced economies. The effects continue to play out. Since mid-October, for example, the price of base metals has declined a further 15 percent while that of oil has declined a further 40 percent. Paradoxically, while risk-averse investors have focused on the potential negative impacts of these developments, each of them is two-sided and carries a silver lining that should make the negative effects on total world growth less dire than markets now seem to expect'especially over the longer term. China's rebalancing is essential for its transition to a more sustainable and resilient consumption-based growth model; lower commodity prices benefit consumers and lower production costs; and the Federal Reserve's well communicated interest-rate increase of December reflects the relatively strong performance of the United States economy, still the world's largest. Yet, these changes also pose big adjustment challenges for many countries, and it is those that dominate the medium-term outlook. **Global outlook** What are the specific numbers? We project that global economic growth of 3.1 percent in 2015 will accelerate to 3.4 percent in 2016 and 3.6 percent in 2017. The 2016 and 2017 figures are both 0.2 percentage point below the levels we hoped for in October. While emerging market and developing economies account for more than two-thirds of this downward revision, we project they will accelerate moderately in both 2016 and 2017, compared to last year. Advanced economies will accelerate slightly in both 2016 and 2017, but likewise, to growth rates slightly below those that the[ last _World Economic Outlook_ foresaw. As always, aggregate averages conceal considerable diversity among individual countries. The small downgrade in our projection of advanced-economy growth is driven by slightly less optimism about the United States. Growth prospects for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan are broadly unchanged. Looming large in the emerging and developing group are countries facing especially severe multiple challenges and strongly negative 2015 growth, for example, Brazil and Russia (along with its CIS neighbors), whose sharp contractions this year should decelerate over the coming two-year period. However, while reduced from earlier years, growth looks better in other Latin American economies and in emerging and developing Europe. Growth prospects in parts of Asia have diminished somewhat as a result of the unexpectedly big external spillovers from China's growth transition. In contrast, India, a major net commodity importer, continues to grow at the fastest pace among large emerging economies. **Downside risks** There are a number of specific downside risks to our scenario, and as always, events in an important stressed economy can spill over to others through effects on trade, asset and commodity prices, and confidence. One downside risk is that China's economy could encounter rough patches where growth slows more than expected, directly affecting trade partners while disturbing foreign exchange and other financial markets worldwide. We have maintained our 2016 and 2017 growth assessments for China in light of the robust development of its service and 'new economy'\u009d sectors, as well as fiscal policy actions aimed at supporting demand. But the picture could change farther down the road. Continued strong growth in China is dependent on its authorities' prompt, decisive action to address remaining imbalances and legacies of past ones. In addition, clear communication of a coherent overall policy strategy, including with respect to the yuan's exchange rate, is critical both for domestic stability and that of markets abroad. Depreciating currencies have been useful shock absorbers for many emerging and developing economies, but could eventually expose corporate balance-sheet weaknesses where there are foreign-currency exposures. Related, private capital inflows to emerging and frontier markets came to a virtual halt in the third quarter of 2015, with China accounting for most of the fall. The acceleration and broadening of this trend is a potential threat despite the enhanced buffers provided by international reserves. Another stress indicator is the general increase in sovereign spreads in Latin America and Africa; and a further increase in global risk aversion, for whatever reason, could lead to even tighter financial conditions for vulnerable economies. Finally, political and geopolitical risks have intensified, not receded, in recent months. Prominent among these, refugee outflows from Syria and Iraq are imposing extreme burdens on neighboring countries and have spilled over into Europe, sparking political discord within the European Union and threatening its current framework for free labor mobility. Rapid absorption of refugees into labor markets will ultimately lift output, but will place up-front demands on public budgets. As difficult as are the challenges for the receiving countries, we must not lose sight of the source-country security concerns that give rise to both internal and external displacements. These impose immense costs, first of all on the refugees themselves. **Need for action** In advanced economies, currently projected growth rates are too low rapidly to reduce high unemployment and other legacies of recent crises, or to spark strong growth in real wages. In emerging and developing economies, currently projected growth rates substantially slow convergence to higher incomes. Action is needed. Policy recommendations must be country-specific, but at a general level there are three priorities. First, to support aggregate demand in the face of subdued activity and, in some countries, continuing deflationary pressures. Second, to support economic efficiency and long-term economic growth in the face of evidence that potential growth rates have fallen worldwide over the past decade. An important element here is structural reform, which will be a main theme of the April 2016 _World Economic Outlook_. A final need is to further strengthen and widen the international safety net, bolstering global resilience to whatever may lie ahead. See also Obstfeld [video and [Infographic.

Climate change is a global problem. Many believed that global problem solving would prove elusive: the benefits of cutting emissions arise globally while the costs of doing so are borne nationally, so national self-interest would prevent a meaningful agreement. Paris proves otherwise'creating a commonality of purpose at the global level. At the core of the agreement are the country-level emission reduction pledges and timetables that were submitted by 186 countries. The agreement also establishes procedures for updating and evaluating progress in meeting these national commitments. Governments will be under considerable public pressure to deliver. How can they make it work? As we argue in our new [paper, the crucial thing is to price energy right. **Getting prices right** According to IMF estimates, energy prices undercharged the true costs of fossil fuel energy use'the supply costs and the damage that energy consumption inflicts on people and the environment'by a total of [$5.3 trillion (or 6\u00c2? percent of Global GDP) in 2015. This estimate of global energy subsidies gives an order of magnitude of the unpriced costs that energy consumption imposes on the economy and environment. Global warming only accounts for around 25 percent of the global subsidies. The other 75 percent of the subsidies include health impacts from exposure to outdoor air pollution, and also undercharging for the local side effects (e.g., congestion) of motor vehicles, energy supply costs, and general consumption taxes. And the benefits from reducing these impacts by reforming energy prices arise, by and large, in the country doing the reform. The good news is that this also means that getting energy prices right at the national level is largely justified in terms of simple national self-interest. **Pricing carbon is part of getting prices right** The heart of the matter is that firms and households are not charged for the environmental consequences of their emissions, most importantly carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by burning fossil fuels. So establishing a proper charge for these emissions is critical. [Pricing carbon is the way forward. The price mechanism engages the full power of human ingenuity in exploring all possible margins for mitigation: reducing energy consumption; shifting from dirtier to cleaner ways of generating energy; and, last but not least, encouraging innovation and technological change. And, in our view, taxation is generally the best way to implement carbon pricing. Ideally, this means extending fuel excises (well established in most countries, and among the easiest of taxes to administer) to include carbon charges and applying similar charges to other petroleum products, coal, and natural gas. The revenues can be used to boost the economy through, for example, cutting taxes on labor and capital that deter work effort and investment, which in turn helps to offset the drag on the economy from higher energy prices. If instead governments use emissions trading systems, these should be designed to look like taxes by auctioning allowances to raise revenue, and including price floors and ceilings. A robust, predictable emission price provides the critical signal for redirecting technological change to low-emission investments. Although the Paris mitigation pledges typically specify emissions targets, it makes more sense to meet these on average over time (with predictable prices) than rigidly meeting them year-to-year (with unpredictable prices). At the IMF, we are assessing the different types of pricing paths that countries will need to do just this. Right now, about 40 national and over 20 sub-national governments have adopted some form of carbon pricing. This is very welcome, but it only scratches the surface of the problem. These schemes cover about 12 percent of global emissions (though this will double when China prices industrial emissions in 2017) and typically with modest prices (around $10 per ton or less). Countries need to transition to greater coverage of emissions, and to prices that are better aligned with their mitigation commitments. As pricing systems continue to proliferate at the national level, at some point it will make sense for countries to enhance these efforts through international coordination. A natural way to do this would be through carbon price floor arrangements (analogous, for example, to tax minima for excises and value added taxes in the European Union). These can provide some protection against competitiveness impacts and allow individual countries, if they wish, to set prices higher than the floor. **New technologies** Renewables and other forms of 'green technology'\u009d are getting a lot of attention from the media. Techno-optimists trumpet a new industrial revolution and governments need to support the invention and development of cleaner technologies. However, in order for these new technologies to be created and widely disseminated, firms have to be rewarded for adopting them'this is the [bottom line. The most effective way to do that is to price carbon right. In the absence of such incentives, relying on technological progress to solve climate change looks a lot like banking on miracles. To follow through on the success of the Paris Agreement we need to get energy prices right and start moving now. Read more about the IMF's work on the environment and energy [here.

However, China's shift from an investment-heavy, export led growth strategy to an economic model that relies more on domestic consumption has led to a dramatic decline in commodity prices. Lower commodity prices and lower volumes of trade have hit sub-Saharan Africa's commodity exporters hard. But over the medium term, this shift may offer sub-Saharan African countries the opportunity to diversify their economies away from natural resources, and create jobs for their young populations, provided they pursue the right policies to foster competitiveness and integrate into global value chains. **Sub-Saharan Africa's new trading partners** A remarkable shift in trading partners has taken place in the past twenty years, especially in the past decade. The move away from advanced economies, which represented close to 90 percent of exports in 1995, toward new partners took place relatively fast. In 2014, export destinations such as Brazil, China, and India, accounted for over 50 percent of sub-Saharan African exports, with China accounting for about half of that (Chart 1). [ Fuel, metal and mineral products represent 70 percent of sub-Saharan African exports to China. On the other hand, the majority of sub-Saharan Africa's imports from China is made of manufactured goods, followed by machinery (Chart 2). [ What has been the economic impact of sub-Saharan Africa's growing engagement with China? Access to new markets for its raw materials has spurred Africa's exports, which quintupled in real value [over the past twenty years. But maybe even more importantly, sub-Saharan Africa's trade engagement with China and other new trading partners has reduced the volatility in its exports. This helped cushion the impact of the global economic crisis in 2008 and 2009, when advanced economies experienced a deep economic deceleration, and thus curbed their demand for imports. At the same time, China actually increased its contribution to the growth of sub-Saharan African exports, which helped cushion the impact on sub-Saharan Africa growth during the Great Recession. On the import side, access to cheap Chinese consumer goods, from clothing to mopeds, has boosted African living standards and contributed to low and stable inflation. **New sources of financing ** A similar reorientation is occurring in sub-Saharan Africa's sources of capital, albeit to a significantly smaller degree. China's outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to sub-Saharan Africa has increased significantly since 2006, however, it remains small in terms of its share of total FDI to sub-Saharan Africa'less than 5 percent in 2012 (Chart 3). [ Nevertheless, China's role as a source of funding for project loans in infrastructure has become more important for sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade. Chinese loans to sub-Saharan Africa as a share of total debt have risen substantially, from less than 2 percent prior to 2005 to about 15 percent in 2012. Moreover, according to the [Heritage Foundation, sub- Saharan Africa accounted for about a quarter of all Chinese engineering contracts worldwide by 2013 on a stock basis. Most of these contracts were awarded in energy (hydropower) and transport (roads, autos, ports, aviation). Coinciding with the achievement of significant debt relief, sub-Saharan Africa has been increasingly able to take advantage of these new sources of financing. In particular, the financing of infrastructure projects, for which little concessional financing is available, has helped African countries expand industrial development and transform the structure of their economies. Moreover, private Chinese entrepreneurs are increasingly investing in services and manufacturing in sub-Saharan Africa providing [potential new sources of opportunities for the continent. **China's economic changes mean Africa should seize the day** China's investment-heavy, export-oriented growth model has benefited Africa and created a basis for further development. In 2010, it accounted for about 20 percent of world consumption of nonrenewable energy resources (oil, gas, coal), 23 percent of major agricultural crops (corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, wheat), and 40 percent of base metals (copper, aluminum). As China rebalances its growth model and relies increasingly on domestic consumption, the short-term impact on Africa's commodity exporters has been severe. The recent precipitous decline in China's imports is particularly worrisome for sub-Saharan Africa since it has led to declines in both the volume and the prices of its exports (Chart 4). Consequently, growth in sub- Saharan Africa for 2015 has weakened markedly compared to previous years, although there are large differences among countries. [ We also see a decline on the investment side. The number of FDI projects registered with China's Ministry of Commerce has dropped from 311 in 2014 to 260 in 2015. In May 2015, the Ministry estimated a 45.9 percent drop in China's FDI flows to Africa in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. China's pledge to provide a further $60 billion in financing for development in Africa over the coming three years is of course welcome. But it remains to be seen whether the commercial opportunities for such financing, notably in the natural resources sectors, will be forthcoming. Despite these short-term challenges, the medium-term opportunities for sub- Saharan Africa and its engagement with China remain strong. The change in China's growth model opens up space, which creates opportunities for developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. Vietnam and Bangladesh have already stepped into the global garment and textile value chains, as China is moving up to other higher value added supply chains. [ In particular, sub-Saharan Africa's demographic transition will mean that by 2035 the number of sub-Saharan Africans reaching working age (15-64) will exceed that of the rest of the world combined (Chart 5), thus, providing a potential source of comparative advantage in abundant labor. If sub-Saharan Africa can foster structural transformation and increase its integration in global value chains over the coming decades, this represents a historical opportunity to boost growth and poverty reduction on the continent. It will be up to policymakers of the continent to seize, not squander, this opportunity.

This leaves investors and policymakers in the dark on a key issue for financial stability. Our [new research in the October 2015 _Global Financial Stability Report_ looks at just how much is at stake. A number of large bond mutual funds use derivatives'contracts that permit investors to bet on the future direction of interest rates. However, unlike bonds, most derivatives only require a small deposit to make the investment, which amplifies their potential gains through leverage, or borrowed money. For this reason, leveraged investments are potentially more profitable, as the gains on invested capital can be larger. For the same reason, losses can be much larger. Derivatives offer mutual fund managers a flexible and less capital intensive alternative to bonds when managing their portfolios. When used to insure against potential changes in interest rates, they are a useful tool. When used to speculate, they can be bad news given the potential for big losses when bets go wrong. **Strong growth in the assets of bond mutual funds active in derivatives ** The assets of large bond mutual funds that use derivatives have increased significantly since the global financial crisis. As you can see below in Chart 1, we now estimate they amount to more than $900 billion, or about 13 percent of the world's bond mutual fund sector. While existing regulations in the United States and the European Union on mutual funds impose clear limits on cash borrowing levels, the amount of leverage that can be achieved through derivatives exposure is potentially large, often multiples of the market value of their portfolios. This may explain why mutual funds accounting for about 2/3 of the assets in our sample disclose derivatives leverage ranging from 100 percent to 1000 percent of net asset value in their annual reports. This range may be also conservative as these are the notional exposures of derivatives adjusted for hedging and netting at the fund manager's discretion. **What makes them sensitive to higher rates and volatile financial markets** Although these leveraged bond mutual funds have not performed differently to benchmarks over the past three years, their relative performance has occurred in a period of both low interest rates and low volatility, which may mask the risks of leverage. This is because the market value of a number of speculative derivatives positions could have been unaffected by the relatively small changes in the price of fixed income assets. In addition, limited investor withdrawals from leveraged bond mutual funds may have also masked the risks of fund managers having to sell-off illiquid derivatives to pay for investor redemptions. In our analysis we find that a portion of leveraged bond mutual funds exhibit both relatively high leverage and sensitivity to the returns of U.S. fixed- income benchmarks, depicted in Chart 2 below. This combination raises a risk that losses from highly leveraged derivatives could accelerate in a scenario where market volatility and U.S. bond yields suddenly rise. Investors in leveraged bond mutual funds, when faced with a rapid deterioration in the value of their investments, may rush to cash in, particularly if this results in greater than expected losses relative to benchmarks (and the historical performance of their investments). This could then reinforce a vicious cycle of fire sales by mutual fund managers, further investor losses and redemptions, and more volatility. **Improve disclosure: regulators need to act** Making a comprehensive assessment of these risks is problematic due to insufficient data; lack of oversight by regulators compounds the risks. The latest [proposals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to enhance regulations and improve disclosure on the derivatives of mutual funds is a welcome step. There is currently no requirement for disclosing leverage data in the United States (and only on a selected basis in some European Union countries). Implementing detailed and globally consistent reporting standards across the asset management industry would give regulators the data necessary to locate and measure the extent of leverage risks. Reporting standards should include enough leverage information (level of cash, assets, and derivatives) to show mutual funds' sensitivity to large market moves'for example, bond funds should report their sensitivity to rate and credit market moves'and to facilitate meaningful analysis of risks across the financial sector.

It Depends What Kind", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=10893", "content": " By [Olivier Blanchard, [Jonathan D. Ostry, [Atish R. Ghosh, and [Marcos Chamon (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) With the expected move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, many are asking about the effects on emerging market countries. Will outflows increase, and how will this affect economic activity in emerging markets? To answer that, we need to know if capital inflows are in general expansionary or contractionary. One would think that the question was settled long ago. But, in fact, it is not. It is a case where theory suggests one thing and practice another. The workhorse model of international macro (the Mundell-Fleming model), for example, suggests that, for a given monetary policy rate, inflows lead to an appreciation, and thus to a contraction in net exports'and a decrease in output. Only if the policy rate is _decreased_ sufficiently can capital inflows be expansionary. Symmetrically, using a model along these lines, Paul Krugman argued in his 2013 Mundell-Fleming [lecture that capital _outflows_ are expansionary. Emerging-market policy makers, however, have a completely different view. They see capital inflows as leading to increases in credit and output unless they are offset by an _increase_ in the policy rate. The evidence appears to support the perception of policy makers. In the typical emerging market case, capital inflows appear to be associated with currency appreciations, credit booms, and output increases ([Ostry et al., 2012a). **What is true in practice can also be true in a model** _ _How can we reconcile the models and reality? The answer we offer in some [recent work relies on extending the set of assets in the economic model, by allowing for both 'bonds'\u009d (the rate on which can be thought of as the policy rate) and 'non-bonds,'\u009d i.e., assets such as equities and bank liabilities which are imperfect substitutes for bonds. In this case, even if the policy rate'which we take to be the rate on bonds'is given, capital inflows may decrease the rate on non-bonds and reduce the cost of financial intermediation. The positive effect of these lower rates on domestic demand may then offset the adverse effects of currency appreciation on external demand. Capital inflows may in this case be expansionary even for a given policy rate. There is thus a tentative reconciliation between the Mundell-Fleming model and policy makers' views. **The role of foreign exchange market intervention** The appropriate policies vis-\u00c3 -vis capital inflows depend very much on the nature of the inflows. Sterilized foreign exchange (FX) market intervention, if done through bonds (as is usually the case), can fully offset the effects of bond inflows, leaving both the exchange rate and interest rates unchanged. In effect, the central bank takes the opposite position of foreigners: as foreigners decrease their holdings of foreign assets and increase their demand for domestic bonds, the central bank decreases its demand for domestic bonds and increases its holdings of foreign assets. When, however, sterilized foreign exchange intervention is used in response to non-bond inflows, it can avoid a currency appreciation (see [Blanchard et al., 2015), but only at the cost of a larger decrease in the rate of return on non-bonds. **Capital controls** Targeted capital controls affect the mix of inflows. Capital controls on bond inflows reduce bond inflows, but increase the effects of non-bond inflows, both on the exchange rate and on the rate of return on non-bonds. If capital controls are instead targeted at non-bond flows, the effect of bond inflows on the exchange rate is magnified. In both cases, targeted capital controls reduce upward pressure on the currency which in turn increases the 'spillover'\u009d effects from the non-targeted inflow on the exchange rate, the rate of return, or both. **Effects of monetary policy** What about the effects of monetary policy? The central bank might have one of two objectives (apart from its output/inflation mandate): stabilize the exchange rate or stabilize the rate of return on non-bonds (or put another way, limit credit expansion). If it targets the former, it will lower the policy rate, while if it targets the latter it will increase the policy rate. This is the form the 'policy dilemma'\u009d takes in our framework, whether to stabilize the exchange rate and accept a larger decline in the rate on non- bonds, or stabilize the rate of return and accept a larger appreciation. This is however a false dilemma, as a combination of instruments can avoid such a trade-off. Indeed, it is notable that monetary policy and foreign exchange intervention can together, in principle, offset the effect of inflows on _both_ the exchange rate and the rate of return to non-bonds without a need for capital controls (see [Ostry et al, 2012b). This is a more optimistic conclusion than the proposition of [Rey (2013) viz. that, short of using macroprudential tools or capital controls, countries cannot divorce themselves from global financial flows. **Evidence broadly supports theory** An empirical exploration faces many challenges, including the fact that the theoretical arguments above relate to the effects of exogenous capital flows. This challenge requires the use of instruments, namely variables that affect inflows but are plausibly not caused by events within the country. In addition, countries to varying degrees make use of different policy tools to cancel the effects of the flows, something that must be controlled for in the empirical approach. With these caveats in mind, our empirical results are broadly supportive of the theory. We find that, while bond inflows have a negative effect on economic activity, non-bond inflows have a significant and positive effect. We also find that non-bond inflows (excluding FDI) have a strong positive effect on credit, much stronger than bond flows, highlighting the key channel we think is at play in the output effects of capital flows. **What this means** Theory suggests that, for a given policy rate, bond inflows lead to currency appreciation and are contractionary, while non-bond inflows lead to an appreciation but also to a decrease in the cost of borrowing, and thus may be expansionary. The empirical evidence is broadly supportive. Exogenous bond inflows appear to have on average small negative effects on output, while exogenous non-bond inflows appear to have a positive effect. Our analysis, if correct, has important implications for the use of policy tools to deal with inflows. Different combinations of tools must be used depending on the nature of the flows.

The result would be higher emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Policymakers should not allow low energy prices to derail the clean energy transition. Action to restore appropriate price incentives, notably through corrective carbon pricing, is urgently needed to lower the [risk of irreversible and potentially devastating effects of climate change. That approach also offers fiscal benefits. **Low for long** Oil prices have dropped by over 60 percent since June 2014 (see Chart 1). A commonly held view in the oil industry is that 'the best cure for low oil prices is low oil prices.'\u009d The reasoning behind this adage is that low oil prices discourage investment in new production capacity, eventually shifting the oil supply curve backward and bringing prices back up as existing oil fields'which can be tapped at relatively low marginal cost' are depleted. In fact, in line with [past experience, capital expenditure in the oil sector has dropped sharply in many producing countries, including the United States. The dynamic adjustment to low oil prices may, however, be different this time around. Oil prices are expected to remain lower for longer. The advent of shale oil production, made possible by hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'\u009d) and horizontal drilling technologies, has added about 4.2 million barrels per day to the crude oil market, contributing to a global supply glut. Shale oil will lead to shorter and more limited oil-price cycles. Indeed, shale requires a lower level of sunk costs than conventional oil, and the lag between first investment and production is much shorter. Furthermore, shale is still at a relatively early stage of its industry life cycle, where the scope for learning is substantial, as shown by production levels that have proven resilient thanks to phenomenal efficiency gains forced by the big drop in oil prices. In addition, [other factors are putting downward pressure on oil prices: change in the strategic behavior of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the projected increase in Iranian exports, the scaling down of global demand (especially from emerging markets), [the secular drop in petroleum consumption in the United States, and some displacement of oil by substitutes. These likely persistent forces, like the growth of shale, point to a 'low for long'\u009d scenario, even after the supply legacy left by the high- price era of the 2000s has dissipated. Futures markets, which show only a modest recovery of prices to around $60 a barrel by 2019, support this view. Natural gas and coal'also fossil fuels'have similarly seen price declines that look to be long-lived. Coal and natural gas are mainly inputs to electricity generation, whereas oil is used mostly to power transportation, yet the prices of all these energy sources are linked, including through oil-indexed contract prices. The North American shale gas boom has resulted in record low prices there. The recent discovery of the giant Zohr gas field off the Egyptian coast will eventually have repercussions on pricing in the Mediterranean region and Europe, and there is significant development potential in many other locales, notably Argentina. Coal prices also are low, owing to oversupply and the scaling down of demand, especially from China, which burns half of the world's coal. **Renewables at risk** [Technological innovations have unleashed the power of renewables such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal. Even Africa and the Middle East, home to economies that are heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports have enormous potential to develop renewables. For example, the United Arab Emirates has endorsed an ambitious target to draw 24 percent of its primary energy consumption from renewable sources by 2021. Progress in the development of renewables could be fragile, however, if fossil fuel prices remain low for long. Renewables account for only a small share of global primary energy consumption, which is still dominated by fossil fuels'30 percent each for coal and oil, 25 percent for natural gas (see Table). But renewable energy will have to displace fossil fuels to a much greater extent in the future to avoid unacceptable climate risks. Unfortunately, the current low prices for oil, gas, and coal may provide scant incentive for research to find even cheaper substitutes for those fuels. There is strong evidence that both [innovation and [adoption of cleaner technology are strongly encouraged by higher fossil fuel prices. The same is true for new technologies for mitigating fossil fuel emissions. The current low fossil-fuel price environment will thus certainly delay the energy transition. That transition'from fossil fuel to clean energy sources'is not the first one. Earlier transitions were those from wood/biomass to coal in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and from coal to petroleum in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One important lesson is that these transitions take a long time to complete. But this time we cannot wait. We owe to electric lighting the fact that there are still whales in the sea. Unless renewables become cheap enough that substantial carbon deposits are left underground for a very long time, if not forever, the planet will likely be exposed to potentially catastrophic climate risks. Some climate impacts may already be discernible. For example, the United Nations Children's Fund [estimates that some 11 million children in eastern and southern Africa face hunger, disease, and water shortages as a result of the strongest El Ni\u00c3?o weather phenomenon in decades. Many scientists believe that El Ni\u00c3?o events, caused by warming in the Pacific, are becoming more intense as a result of climate change. **Getting the price of carbon right** Nations from around the world have gathered in Paris for the _United Nations Climate Change Conference_, COP-21, with the goal of a universal and potentially legally binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We need very broad participation to address fully the global 'tragedy of the commons'\u009d that results when countries fail to take into account the negative impact of their carbon emissions on the rest of the world. Moreover, free riding by non-participants, if sufficiently widespread, can undermine the political will to action of participating countries. The nations participating at COP-21 are focusing on quantitative emissions- reduction commitments (the [Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, or INDCs). Economic reasoning shows that the least expensive way for each country to implement its INDC is to put a price on carbon emissions. The reason is that when carbon is priced, those emissions reductions that are least costly to implement will happen first. The IMF [calculates that countries can generate substantial fiscal revenues'revenues that would allow lower distorting taxes and new investments in the economy'by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and levying carbon charges that capture the domestic damages caused by emissions. A tax on upstream carbon sources is one easy way to put a price on carbon emissions, although some countries may wish to use other methods, such as emissions trading schemes. Countries that implement their INDCs through a domestic carbon price will reach their goals at lowest cost to themselves, but without global coordination on carbon prices, the cost to the world economy of whatever aggregate emissions reduction is achieved will be unnecessarily high. In order to maximize global welfare, every country's carbon pricing should reflect not only the purely domestic damages from emissions (for example, health effects of the particulates associated with [burning coal), but also the [damages to foreign countries. Setting the right carbon price will therefore [efficiently align the costs paid by carbon users with the true social opportunity cost of using carbon. By raising relative demand for clean energy sources, a carbon price would also help to align the market return to clean- energy innovation with its social return, spurring the refinement of existing technologies and the development of new ones. And it would raise the demand for mitigation technologies such as carbon capture and storage, spurring their further development. If not corrected by the appropriate carbon price, low fossil fuel prices are not accurately signaling to markets the true social profitability of clean energy. While alternative estimates of the damages from carbon emissions differ, and it is especially hard to reckon the likely costs of possible catastrophic climate events, most estimates suggest substantial negative effects. Direct subsidies to R&amp;D have been adopted by some governments but are a poor substitute for a carbon price: they do only part of the job, leaving in place market incentives to over-use fossil fuels and thereby add to the stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases without regard to the collateral costs. Politically, low oil prices may provide an opportune moment to eliminate subsidies and introduce carbon prices that could gradually rise over time toward efficient levels. However, it is probably unrealistic to aim for the full optimal price in one go. Global carbon pricing will have important redistributive implications, both across and within countries, and these call for gradual implementation, complemented by mitigating and adaptive measures that shield the most vulnerable. The hope is that the success of the Paris conference opens the door to future international agreement on carbon prices. Agreement on an international carbon-price floor would be a good starting point in that process. Failure to address comprehensively the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, however, exposes all generations, present and future, to incalculable risks.

The past few decades have seen increases not just in trade in goods and services but trade in assets, as countries relax restrictions on the ability of capital to flow across national boundaries. Surprisingly, while the impact of trade in goods and services on inequality has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the distributional impacts of opening up capital markets. [Our paper fills this gap. Using a data set for nearly 150 countries from 1970 to 2010, we show that increases in capital account liberalization are followed by increases in inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. However, we also show two channels where evidence of this association is limited: First, the impact of liberalization on inequality is smaller for countries with higher levels of financial development and inclusion. Second, the impact is also smaller in cases where the liberalization is not followed by a crisis. These results are consistent with the IMF's institutional view that 'capital flow liberalization is generally more beneficial and less risky if countries have reached certain levels or thresholds of financial and institutional development.'\u009d **Openness and inequality** Chart 1 shows the impact over a five-year period of capital account liberalization on inequality, as measured by the Gini Coefficient. Our measure of capital account openness is the Chinn-Ito index, which measures a country's openness based on the restrictions on cross-border financial transactions reported by the IMF. The index varies greatly across income groups, but capital account openness has increased in all income groups, with a significant rise occurring at the beginning of the 1990s. Capital account liberalization has typically increased the Gini index by 1 percent within two years of the liberalization and by 1.5 percent within five years. The robustness of this qualitative result to various stress tests is extensively documented in [our paper. [ **Exploring the channels ** Why is openness associated with a rise in inequality? We suggest two possibilities. First, it is commonly argued that the benefits of capital account liberalization depend on the quality of financial institutions. Where institutions are weak and the access to credit is not inclusive, liberalization may exacerbate inequality by increasing the bias in financial access in favor of the privileged. Indeed, we find that the increase in inequality in the aftermath of liberalization is higher in countries where financial inclusion is lower (Chart 2). [ Second, when capital account liberalization is not well managed, or not well sequenced with other reforms, it increases the likelihood of financial crises. Many studies have found that such crises disproportionately hurt the poor. We find support for this view: the impact of openness on inequality is sharply higher in cases where there a financial crisis in the immediate aftermath of liberalization (Chart 3). [ **Policy implications** Our results do not imply that countries should not undertake capital account liberalization. As noted in '[The Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows: An Institutional View'\u009d (IMF 2012): 'Capital flows can have substantial benefits for countries, including by enhancing efficiency, promoting financial sector competitiveness, and facilitating greater productive investment and consumption smoothing. At the same time, capital flows also carry risks, which can be magnified by gaps in countries' financial and institutional infrastructure.'\u009d Our findings, however, suggest a need for proceeding with caution, given that capital flows can be volatile and'particularly given their large size relative to domestic markets'can pose a risk to economic and financial stability. Further, countries where reducing inequality is an important policy goal may need to design liberalization in a manner that addresses its impact on inequality. The [institutional view also notes that capital flow liberalization is generally more beneficial and less risky if countries have reached certain levels or thresholds of financial and institutional development. Here again, our results are consistent with this view. Where financial inclusion is high and the liberalization well managed, the impact of liberalization on inequality is muted. At a time when rising inequality is a source of concern to many governments, weighing the benefits of capital account liberalization against the distributional effects may be important. Awareness of these effects might lead some governments to choose to design policy actions in a way that redresses the distributional impacts.

This issue remains a key challenge for policy makers. As we show in our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report,_ part of the solution to address this legacy is an upgrade in legal systems. Current inefficiencies'long foreclosure times and insolvency procedures'are a reason for the gap between the value of loans on bank balance sheets and the price investors are willing to pay. A reliable legal environment and an efficient judicial system maximize the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs), reduce the value gap and give banks greater incentive to get NPLs off the books. Our analysis, using time to foreclose as a proxy for effective insolvency regimes, shows there is a large upside for new lending capacity in the euro area (Chart 1). Slow foreclosure times impede rapid NPL resolution leading to higher NPL ratios. For example, in Italy, the current time to foreclose of four years is twice the current euro area average. Italy's average NPL ratio of about 11% is 1.6 times the euro area average. [ **Reforms could unleash almost '\u00ac 600 billion in new lending ** Creating incentives for the effective restructuring or resolution of nonperforming loans by achieving a foreclosure time of one year maximum in each country can create a new lending potential of about '\u00ac600 billion for the euro area as a whole.

Devaluation boosts the competitiveness of a country's exports and curtails imports by making them more costly. Together, the higher exports and the reduced imports generate some of the financial resources needed to help the country get out of trouble. For countries that belong to'and want to stay in'a currency union, however, devaluation is not an option. This was the situation facing several euro area economies at the onset of the global financial crisis: capital had been flowing into these countries before the crisis but much of it fled when the crisis hit. A remedy for these economies that has generated a lot of debate is so-called internal devaluation. This is a boost to competitiveness not through an (external) devaluation of the currency but by internal means, such as wage cuts or wage moderation. Can such internal devaluations work? Our [recent paper provides an answer. The main take-away from the paper is that, if undertaken by several crisis-hit countries at the same time, wage moderation can only work well if supported by accommodative monetary policies. In the absence of such policies, wage moderation does not deliver much of a boost to output in the countries that are undertaking it, and also ends up lowering output in the euro area as a whole. **The start of an answer** The specific policy considered for simulations purposes in our paper is a 2 percent reduction in wage (and price) inflation. While wage moderation does boost competitiveness and exports, its overall effect on output in the short run is uncertain. The reason is lower nominal wage growth and lower inflation'or possibly deflation'can suppress domestic demand and increase the real burden of debt. So the competitiveness and aggregate demand effects work in opposite directions. To determine which effect prevails in the short run, our paper uses a large- scale model of the world economy. The model contains individual blocks for 11 euro area economies, including the five economies that suffered large capital flight, which we refer to as the 'crisis-hit' economies. The model simulations show that whether the competitiveness or demand effects dominate in the short run depends on two important factors: * the number of countries that are undertaking wage moderation * the actions taken by the central bank. These two factors also play a key role in determining the spillovers from wage moderation, namely, the impact that wage moderation by a country (or a set of countries) has on other countries, in particular on the rest of the euro area. Specifically, the model simulations provide the following results: * If a single euro area crisis-hit economy undertakes wage moderation, the net effect on output is positive both for that economy as well as for the entire euro area. * If all crisis-hit economies, which account for some 30 percent of the euro area total GDP, undertake wage moderation together, their output still expands, albeit to a lesser degree. If the central bank is able to cut policy interest rates, output also expands in the entire euro area. This is because the central bank is able to offset the adverse impact of wage moderation by some countries on the output of other countries by lowering policy interest rates. This in turn lowers long term interest rates in these countries, boosting investment and consumption of durables. [ **The rest of the answer** Things change when policy interest rates are lowered to zero, that is, they hit the zero lower bound. When this happens, the negative impact of wage moderation in the crisis-hit economies on output in the other economies cannot be offset by a cut in interest rates. Unless other actions are taken to lower long term interest rates, euro area-wide output contracts in the short run. The central bank, however, is not out of ammunition when policy interest rates hit zero. It can take actions to directly lower long term interest rates, a policy known as quantitative easing. The model simulations confirm that if the central bank takes actions that result in a 50 basis point reduction in long term interest rates, output in the crisis-hit economies as well as the euro area as a whole rises modestly in response to wage moderation. But wait, there's more. If, additionally, the European Union economies implement the structural reforms they committed to under the Group of Twenty initiative launched by Australia in 2014, output increases further. Importantly, structural reforms that boost productivity have a stronger, supportive effect on consumption and investment in the short run than reforms that boost labor supply.**_ _** **How does IMF advice stack up?** The IMF has always advocated a comprehensive package that addresses both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. On the supply side, IMF advice has emphasized structural labor market reforms, with a view to lowering natural unemployment or raising labor force participation. IMF staff advice has also underscored the benefits of structural reforms. On the demand side, the IMF was one of the early advocates of supportive monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to boost aggregate demand in the euro area. An explicit incomes policy to engineer an internal devaluation has not been part of any IMF-supported program for euro area countries. Our results emphasize that if such policies are considered in a set of euro area crisis- hit countries, the adverse spillover effects on output in the rest of the euro area should be kept in mind.

So it's not surprising that reducing inequality is an integral part of the [Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations summit in September. I often discuss with my colleagues where sub-Saharan Africa stands with respect to these objectives. Unfortunately, the region remains one of the most unequal in the world, on par with Latin America (see Chart 1). In fact, inequality seems markedly higher at all levels of income in the region than elsewhere (see Chart 2). [ [ While the last 15 years of high growth in sub-Saharan Africa has pushed up per capita incomes, disappointingly, income inequality within countries has not followed suit and has instead remained broadly stable. And gender inequality has declined more slowly than in other regions. **Reducing inequality also increases growth** My colleagues in the IMF's African Department sought to shed some light on this issue in our latest economic [outlook report for the region. We all have our personal views as to why inequality is an issue, but we were particularly interested to see whether high inequality was detrimental to economic prosperity in the region, building on [earlier work done for more advanced economies. We found that inequality indeed has an adverse effect on growth in the region. More specifically, our research finds that real per capita GDP growth in sub- Saharan African countries could be higher by close to one percentage point per year if inequalities'both income and gender'were reduced to the levels observed in the fast-growing economies of Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. That's as much as **_half_** of the growth gap between those countries and sub-Saharan Africa. Of course this finding does not apply uniformly to all 45 countries in Sub- Saharan Africa: * In the region's low-income and fragile countries such as Niger and Mali, the drag on growth is stronger from infrastructure and human capital gaps and, to a lesser degree, from the prevailing gender Hence, addressing infrastructure and human capital gaps should remain the policy priority to raise growth. * In the region's middle-income countries such as South Africa, on the other hand, there could be a growth dividend for policies directly aimed at reducing inequality. There, the growth payoff from reducing income and gender inequalities to the Asian countries' level appears higher than that of closing the infrastructure gap. * For oil exporters such as Angola and Cameroon legal restrictions on women's participation in economic activities combines with the infrastructure gap as the most important factors explaining the growth differential with the Asian countries. At a time when the growth outlook in the region is getting cloudier, these findings make it all the more important for governments to prioritize policy actions and target those measures that could best unleash the growth potential AND lift inequality. I see three main avenues to follow: **First,** fiscal policy actions have an important role to play. Many tax systems in the region depend on exemptions and reduced rates for basic goods that weaken the potential yield of the Value Added Tax, while at the same time most revenues foregone accrue to the better off. Even though the poor spend a large proportion of their income on basic goods, the rich are likely to spend more in absolute terms. That's why the IMF has argued for phasing out VAT exemptions while transforming expenditure policy into a sharper tool for addressing inequalities. Abolishing fuel subsidies, which mainly benefit middle and higher income households, and replacing them with transfer schemes targeted at poor households would also go a long way toward reducing inequality. **Second**, better access to financial services can also help address inequalities. For example, establishing credit bureaus that centralize information can encourage banks to lend to new customers, because information about these potential customers becomes easily available. Meanwhile, some African countries, in particular Kenya where nearly 60 percent of the adult population has access to mobile money, have demonstrated how the use of mobile banking can help disseminate access to financial services to remote regions. **Third**, abolishing legal restrictions for women would provide quick gains for countries that need to strengthen growth. For example, eight countries in Sub-Saharan Africa still have ten or more such restrictions, including women not being able to open a bank account or start a new job without the consent of their husband. Removing these restrictions where they exist is a low hanging fruit to support growth, especially at a time when many countries are being hard hit by slumping commodity prices. They should take solace in the experience of countries like Namibia where the removal of restrictions resulted in an increase in participation in the labor force and hence stronger growth. More inclusive and better-distributed growth also has implications for sustainable growth. Sub-Saharan Africa's growth record over the last decade or so has been impressive, but less so its record on the inclusiveness front. I believe our work shows how countries can reverse these premises: With growth slowing down in the region, it is more than ever time to make more progress on inequality.

And these numbers could increase further in the near future.** ** The immediate priority must be to help the refugees'who bear the heaviest burden, and too often tragically'with better access to shelter, health care and quality education. Many of the countries neighboring conflict zones'which have welcomed most of the refugees'have stretched their capacity to absorb people to the limit. To support additional public services for refugees, they will require more financial resources. The international community must play its part. With the IMF's support, for example, Jordan has been able to adjust its fiscal targets to help meet this need. Those countries that have done most to welcome displaced people are to be commended. Some countries have been willing to receive large flows of refugees and done their utmost to provide them with food and shelter. Others, especially among advanced countries, should look at how they might increase their scope for admitting more refugees. Ultimately, however, one thing is very clear: no country can manage the refugee issue on their own. We need global cooperation. **Migration's economic implications** Cross-border migration, of course, comes in several forms. It includes both refugees who are _forced_ to leave their country and economic migrants who _voluntarily_ leave in search of opportunities. This total number of migrants has risen significantly in recent years, now accounting for over 3 percent of the global population. Regardless of the motivation, the decision to uproot and leave one's home is difficult and can be risky. But once people pass through the journey, resettle, and find stability, migration can'with the right policies'have an overall positive economic impact: for migrants, their host country, and their country of origin (as shown in staff [analysis). Migrants can boost a country's labor force, encourage investment and boost growth. Preliminary IMF calculations show a modest positive impact on growth from migrants in EU countries, for example. More importantly, migration can also help address the challenges from aging populations in a number of advanced countries. Over the medium term, our research shows that migrants could help reduce pressures on pension and health spending; and in the near term, the net budgetary impact tends to be relatively small. ** ** **Brain drain and remittances** What about countries experiencing an _outflow_ of migrants? Certainly, these countries often lose their youngest and brightest, with important implications for growth. This has been the case in Caribbean countries, for instance, which lost over 50 percent of their high-skilled labor between 1965 and 2000. Remittances help to counterbalance some of these effects. Indeed, they can be a very important source of income'which has been shown to lead to higher education and health spending. In 2014, remittance flows to developing countries amounted to $436 billion, more than half of total net foreign direct investment and well over three times as much as official development assistance. Moreover, if the transaction costs of remittances could be lowered further, even greater benefits would accrue. Estimates suggest that reducing remittance costs to one percent of the amount transferred could release savings of $30 billion per year, more than the entire bilateral aid budget to sub-Saharan Africa! We should strongly support the G-20's commitment to reduce remittance transaction costs. **Policies to better integrate migrants** The key challenge is to facilitate the smooth integration of newcomers'whether economic migrants or refugees. No doubt, there will be hardship and difficulties at the outset, whether logistical, fiscal, or political, but these need to be weighed against the benefits that accrue over the medium to longer term. Easier said than done'but it _can_ be done. What does a well-designed integration policy include? * First, **_strengthening the ability of labor markets to absorb migrants_**'by enabling immediate ability to seek work and providing better job matching services. * Second, **_enhancing access to education and training_**'by providing affordable education, language and job training. * Third, **_improving skill recognition_**'by adopting simple, affordable and transparent procedures to recognize foreign qualifications. * Finally, **_supporting migrant entrepreneurs_**'by reducing barriers to start-ups and providing support with legal advice, counseling and training. In Sweden, for instance, an introduction program for refugees provides employment preparation and language training for up to 24 months, together with financial benefits. The program is beginning to help the latest inflow of refugees to find jobs'even though it will inevitably take time to fully succeed. **A global call** Demographic forces, globalization, and environmental degradation mean that migration pressures across borders will likely increase in the coming decades. And cross-border challenges demand cross-border solutions. Global policy efforts, therefore, must focus on better cooperation and dialogue among the affected countries. This includes promoting fair burden- sharing, facilitating remittance flows, protecting labor rights, and promoting a safe and secure working environment for migrants. The IMF will also do its part, including through our financing and capacity building. In addition, over the next few months, our analysis on this issue will feed into our policy advice to countries in Africa, Europe and the Middle East dealing with massive population movements. Migration is a global issue. We must all work together to address it. See _[International Migration: Recent Trends, Economic Impacts, and Policy Implications, _IMF staff background paper.

The fifteen largest emerging market economies grew by 48% from 2009 to 2014, a period when the Group of Twenty economies collectively expanded by 6%. How did emerging markets sustain this growth? In part, they drew upon bank lending to drive corporate credit expansion, strong earnings, and low defaults. This credit boom, combined with falling commodity prices and foreign currency borrowing, now leaves emerging market firms vulnerable and financial sectors under stress, as we discuss in the latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_. **Credit booms and credit gaps often foreshadow severe bad debt cycles** Credit booms can feed the buildup of risks to the financial system'excess investment leading to surplus production capacity, deteriorating cash flow for corporates, rising default risk, and ultimately bank capital losses. The credit gap, a measure of a country's increase in borrowing (credit to GDP ratio) relative to its historical average, highlights vulnerable countries. By the end of 2014, China, Thailand, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia all had credit gaps above 10%, a level often considered the benchmark for risky credit booms (Chart 1). China's 25% credit gap places the country in the 5% highest credit gaps across emerging markets since the 1970s. This is consistent with other signs of strain: the growth of opaque 'shadow credit' markets, and Chinese policymakers' desire to limit financial market developments (for example, corporate defaults or volatility in equity and currency markets) that could trigger spillovers across the credit system. [ However, credit gaps do not capture all problems. Russia, Argentina and India currently have low credit gaps. Other factors also can cause stress for the financial system. The interaction of excessive credit growth with a broad range of other factors renders current conditions across emerging market economies particularly worrisome. Recent depreciation of corporates' home currencies against the dollar and falling commodity prices are increasing stress on weaker borrowers, and increased borrowing rates could exacerbate the situation. Our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ focuses on these risks. **Emerging market banks have not increased buffers ahead of the bad debt cycle** Consistent with the beginning of the end of the credit boom, emerging market banks are starting to see new non-performing loans at a faster rate, which is now above developed economy levels for the first time since the financial crisis (Chart 2). [ At first blush, emerging market banks appear to have adequate capital and other buffers against financial losses. Their aggregate Tier 1 capital ratio is about 11%, well above the regulatory minimum, and has actually risen slightly since 2009. At the same time, regulatory standards and market expectations have raised the bar considerably over that period. Advanced economy banks, despite much lower stated profitability than their emerging market peers, have collectively engineered a nearly 4 percentage points increase in Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios. More broadly, the end of a credit boom is normally when banks have built-up their capital buffers through years of high earnings. But, rather than conserving capital to buffer the inevitable turn of the credit cycle, emerging market banks channeled essentially all the earnings into underwriting further growth. As the boom cycle approaches its end, the need to build reserves against rising credit losses will strain future earnings and the ability of banks to maintain credit growth. Emerging market economies now face the risk of rising credit costs, slowing bank earnings, decelerating credit growth, and weak economic performance. These potential weaknesses have serious economic implications for emerging markets and, given their size, for the global economy. **These issues call for a mix of micro- and macroprudential policies** The policy responses are both straightforward and difficult. At this late stage in the credit cycle, recent market turbulence is a warning to policymakers of the need to prevent further deterioration in financial sector conditions. In many countries, the risks of continued rapid credit growth increasingly outweigh its economic benefits. This underscores the need to deploy available micro- and macroprudential tools designed to keep individual institutions and the financial system as a whole safe, to discourage the further accumulation of excess borrowing and foreign indebtedness. Effective microprudential policies might include higher risk weights (capital requirements) or perhaps caps on the most problematic exposures, which might include property developers, commodity producers and companies with large foreign currency borrowings. Many countries should make stronger corporate insolvency regimes a priority. Corporate debt in emerging markets makes them vulnerable particularly if interest rates rise. In the current environment, regulators should pay special attention to the vulnerabilities created by borrowing from overseas and in foreign currencies. At the microprudential level, regulators need to monitor banks' and borrowers' foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions, and introduce and strengthen stress tests related to foreign currency risks. At the macroprudential level, maintaining sovereign investment grade-status is crucial. Accelerating measures to foster money market and corporate bond issuance may also improve corporates' access to funding pools that reduce dependence on capital-constrained banks and potentially flighty offshore creditors.

From S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo to Johannesburg, citizens have taken to the streets against graft. In countries like Chile, Guatemala, India, Iraq, Malaysia and Ukraine, they are sending a clear and loud message to their leaders: Address corruption! Policymakers are paying attention too. Discussing corruption has long been a sensitive topic at inter-governmental organizations like the International Monetary Fund. But earlier this month at its Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, the IMF hosted a refreshingly [frank discussion on the subject. _ _The panel session provided a stimulating debate on definitions of corruption, its direct and indirect consequences, and strategies for addressing it, including the role that individuals and institutions such as the IMF can play. This blog gives a flavor of the discussion. **What is corruption** Defining corruption may seem easy. Most people will have the sense that they know it when they see it. For example, a public official takes a bribe in exchange for providing a financial or political gain. However, experts increasingly consider corruption to be much broader. Rather than merely being a transaction between two parties, as one panelist put it, corruption can be viewed as 'the privatization of public policy.'\u009d Powerful elites in business and politics collude to control public institutions, capture the policy-making process, and monopolize government contracting and procurement. Another panelist defined corruption even more broadly as 'the lack of impartiality in government'\u009d, where public money and authority are used in ways that impact negatively on human well-being. **The costs of corruption** The direct economic costs are obvious to most people. Demand for bribes by providers of services affects achievement of social outcomes. The bribe to the taxman that reduces public revenues, and lowers government's provision of public services. A school that is not built because the allocated funds have been misappropriated. Yet, the indirect costs are likely to be economically far-reaching. As investigated in [Governance, Corruption, and Economic Performance by George T. Abed and Sanjeev Gupta (editors), corruption has a negative impact on economic growth through, for example, the over-investment in rent seeking, the underinvestment in productive activities, and the perpetuation of inefficient policies, among other things. The economic costs of corruption, which by the way afflicts countries at all stages of development, are substantial. One 2005 [study estimated that the global cost of bribery alone could be as high as 1.5 trillion dollars (in the order of 2 percent of the world's current GDP). Other studies show a strong correlation between lower levels of corruption and long- term improvements in GDP per capita and in human development indices. In sum, corruption is a tax on growth and investment. Moreover, some panelists emphasized that the costs are not only economic in nature. Corruption also contributes to the loss of public trust in government, higher levels of inequality in political influence, the deterioration of public values and, ultimately, to the diminution of citizens' well-being or quality of life. These non-economic costs create a vicious cycle of under- performance of the public sector that is harmful to the economy in the long- term.** ** **Broad and multifaceted approach required**** ** Given how broadly corruption and its consequences are now viewed, all panelists agreed that addressing it also requires a broad and multifaceted approach. Such a holistic approach requires leadership, changing incentives and building values, which are all mutually-reinforcing. * **First**, leaders must be willing to bring to account powerful vested interests'the big fish rather than the small fish, the tigers rather than the flies. They must also set the example by being above reproach. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore is a prime example of a leader who successfully fought corruption through his own personal example and the political will that he engendered. * **Second**, strong incentives. Leadership must be complemented by a strong system of carrots and sticks'positive reinforcement and accountability. There needs to be a clear framework to combat corruption that is enforced. At the same time, governments need to ensure that public officials earn a living wage. Openness of the economy through deregulation and liberalization will also help since overly-regulated economies create strong incentives to maintain corrupt practices. Poland is a good example of quick and effective liberalization measures. Transparency of government operations and transactions is also important as a disincentive. * **Three**, building values of integrity. Countries need to promote a culture that values clean government. Building such a culture requires education of citizens. Formal training can help, but ultimately values must be learned through the education system, peer pressure and the day-to-day work experiences and practices of institutions. **How the IMF can help**** ** Given that corruption has implications for the soundness of public finances and for the stability of financial markets'issues of direct interest to the IMF'panelists emphasized that the Fund has a clear interest in helping its members to tackle corruption. The IMF assists countries to deter corruption through better design and transparency of public financial management systems (see, for example, [IMF Fiscal Transparency Code) and by supporting stable and transparent economic and regulatory environments that limit the scope for arbitrary and preferential treatment. In crisis situations where dealing with corruption is deemed to be critical for macroeconomic stability, the Fund has been more active. In some instances, it has insisted on the reform of legislative frameworks for anti-corruption and of law enforcement functions. Kenya, Indonesia and Ukraine are examples. In most cases, corruption starts long before it becomes critical to the economy. How early should the IMF become more directly involved in helping to address it? Given the long-term impact of corruption, should discussions be integrated in the IMF's annual consultations with its members? Here, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, David Lipton, acknowledged that this is not an easy question. While member countries are more open to discussing corruption, it is still a sensitive topic and the IMF role will require some further examination and discussion. In any case, Mr. Lipton emphasized, when a country shows real political will to tackle corruption, the IMF should help it to make the bold and comprehensive changes to economic policies and regulatory frameworks that are necessary to decisively limit the costs of this hidden tax.

It is therefore not surprising that policymakers across the region are eagerly searching for ways to revitalize growth. One answer may be more trade'both within the region and with the rest of the world. [Our new study analyzes the export performance in developing and emerging market regions over the past two decades to assess the potential for future export growth in Latin America. We find evidence that most countries in the region 'undertrade'\u009d compared to what standard models would predict. This has been an entrenched problem for almost a quarter of a century, partly as a result of the region's geography and a legacy of protectionist policies. We argue that integration into multi-nation production processes (in other words, global value chains) and trade agreements could help, but they are far from magic bullets, particularly in the current global environment. Latin American authorities need to design policies that will increase the competitiveness of their exports and allow them to penetrate large markets, typically in advanced economies. **Weak trade** To estimate trade performance, we identify trade intensity gaps (or export gaps) in the region for the period 1990'2013. We look at variables such as geographic distance, economic size, and certain historical or cultural features. The 'unexplained'\u009d part of exports'which is the difference between actual and predicted exports'represents the positive or negative export 'gap.'\u009d The gap tells us whether a country is overtrading or undertrading given their fundamentals. Compared with the rest of the world, Latin American countries are on average undertrading (see Chart 1 and 2), especially South American countries. Moreover, Latin America has not improved its measured export performance over the past two decades, which stands in stark contrast with the performance of emerging and developing Asia. Our findings apply to both gross exports and value-added exports''a concept that has become increasingly popular in order to strip out the foreign content of exports, which is large when countries use many foreign intermediate goods to produce exports. Our results indicate that Asia overtrades both in terms of gross exports and in value-added terms, so its strong performance in gross exports does not rely solely on the foreign content of exports. **Regional differences** There are, however, important differences across the region (see Chart 3). Mexico stands out for its overtrading in gross exports, but shows a much weaker performance in value-added exports. These results are overwhelmingly driven by the bilateral trade flows between Mexico and the United States, consistent with strengthening supply chain linkages (for example, in the auto industry) between these countries. Chile is also a strong trade performer. This is heavily influenced by links with China, as expected, but Japan and Korea also appear as important export destinations. Despite having a narrow export base, Chile appears to have been able to increase the volume of exports, which cannot be said about other commodity exporters in the region. Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia have the weakest trade performance in Latin America. In the cases of Argentina and Brazil, weak exports to major advanced economies''particularly the United States''is a key contributing factor. For Colombia, weak exports to Mexico and Brazil play an important role. Other countries display small deviations of export performance from what would be consistent with economic fundamentals. Venezuela stands out as an 'overtrading'\u009d country in value added terms. This is because Venezuela exports more oil, which has high domestic content, than would be predicted given fundamentals.** ** [ **Global value chains and trade agreements** To assess whether greater trade integration could promote Latin American exports, we augmented our model to include variables related to global value chains and trade agreements. The results indicate that stronger global value chain integration at the country-level leads to improved bilateral performance in the region both in gross and value-added exports. However, the direct short-term impact is economically small. This suggests that trade integration alone is not sufficient to deliver an immediate boost to trade. To reap long-term gains, Latin America needs to leverage [global value chain trade to promote knowledge spillovers and innovation, a long-standing challenge for the region. We found mixed results regarding the benefits of trade agreements, suggesting that their impact hinges fundamentally on design and implementation characteristics of accompanying reforms and the agreements themselves. **New opportunities** Despite policy efforts in Latin America to lower trade barriers, the region has remained more closed than other emerging market regions and most countries are undertrading. While remaining realistic about the potential for significant improvements, here's how some policies can help: * Efforts to penetrate large markets are crucial, particularly in advanced economies. Bolder progress in structural reforms is needed in order to increase market share in a competitive environment. * The region could benefit from greater integration into global value chains. However, the direct impact on trade from such strategy will remain small unless integration leads to sustained productivity growth, via learning spillovers and greater intra-industry trade. * Trade agreements are not a magic wand for boosting trade. Comprehensive agreements'as the Trans Pacific Partnership aims to be'that reduce both tariffs and non-tariff barriers, harmonize regulatory frameworks, and involve large advanced and emerging economies, should have a positive effect in the medium-term. In contrast, regionally-protected trade blocks appear less promising. Countries in Latin America, most of which are not involved in the Partnership, should guard against the risk of being left out from multi-regional deals in a fast-changing world trade landscape.

Is the neutral real interest rate lower than before the crisis? Should we raise inflation targets? What can we learn from the unconventional policies that emerging markets adopted during the crisis? Are we entering an environment of global deflation? And if so, can the existing central bank toolkit stave off that threat? Seven years after the crisis, the effects of unconventional monetary policies continue to be a matter of debate. There is little consensus not only about the effectiveness of these policies in promoting aggregate demand, but also about possible unintended side effects on financial stability. Meanwhile, emerging market economies have felt the spillovers from both the global financial crisis and unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies, often adopting their own unconventional credit and foreign-exchange policies. The effectiveness of those policies remains subject to debate, as do the merits of global policy coordination between countries at different cyclical conjunctures. Accordingly, with monetary policies in major currency areas now once again headed in opposite directions, the profession faces the challenge of understanding the risks of policy normalization and monetary policy divergence. The upcoming [IMF Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference on **'_Unconventional Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies_'\u009d **(November 5-6, 2015) will give us an opportunity to take stock of these outstanding policy questions, to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms at play and the tools available to policymakers, and to map the way forward. We hope the program will contribute to a better understanding on how unconventional monetary policies work; their interactions with other policies; their domestic side effects, including risks to financial stability; their spillovers to other countries; the future of these policy tools; the consequences of unconventional policies in emerging market economies; and other topics. **All-Star lineup** As usual, the Polak conference brings together the sharpest minds in the profession'high-caliber academics as well as policy-oriented researchers from both inside and outside the IMF. It will feature thirteen excellent papers and discussants. **Ben S.

But in many countries, something more dramatic is going on'the population is actually _shrinking_. These demographic developments portend stark fiscal challenges. What should countries'whatever their degree of economic development'[do to respond to these challenges? **Large increases in spending are likely outcomes** By the end of this century, according to recently released UN projections, populations will be shrinking in about two-thirds of the world's countries: nearly 70 percent of more-developed countries and about 65 percent of less- developed ones (Figure 1). [ They will also be aging. For the world as a whole, the share of the population older than age 65 is expected to increase from 12 percent today to 38 percent by 2100 (Figure 2, which shows the old-age dependency ratio: the 65-and-older population as a percentage of the population aged 15 to 64). [ These two factors'shrinking and aging populations'will exert pressure on public finances. With current policies unchanged, spending on age-related programs (pensions and health) will rise, and the increase in outlays for these programs will be staggering. In more-developed countries, spending will reach 25 percent of GDP by the end of the century; in less-developed countries, to 16 percent of GDP (Figure 3). The fiscal consequences are potentially dire: such spending increases could lead to unsustainable public debt, require sharp cuts in other spending, or necessitate large tax increases that stifle economic growth. [ **Population projections pose additional risks** In the past, demographers have often underestimated declines in both fertility and mortality rates. If fertility and mortality turn out to be lower than forecast, the impact on fiscal variables will be even larger. For example, lower fertility on its own could (by increasing the ratio of older individuals to younger) raise age-related spending by another 8 percentage points of GDP in more-developed countries and another 4\u00c2? percentage points in less-developed countries by the end of the century. The fiscal impact of any larger-than- forecast increases in longevity would be on top of this. **But policy changes now can make a big difference later** The stark magnitude of the challenge necessitates a multi-pronged approach that could encompass the following: * _Entitlement reform'starting now, but at a gradual pace_. This would spread the burden across generations and decrease the risk of policy reversals. One of the most urgent priorities is to contain the growth of health care spending, which has yet to be reformed to the same degree as pension spending. For example, if growth in health care costs per capita were kept in line with growth in GDP per capita, we estimate that this would lower public health care spending by 4\u00c2? percentage points of GDP by 2100 in more-developed countries and 3 percentage points of GDP in less-developed countries. Countries could pursue this in a number of ways: by increasing competition among insurers and service providers, improving the provider payment system to control costs, paying more attention to primary and preventive health, and making more effective use of health information technology. Another important reform is increasing retirement ages to match longevity gains. Many countries have raised retirement ages over the last decade; however, these increases may not prove sufficient to sustain pension systems. Increasing the retirement age by an extra five years has the potential to yield savings on pension spending of about 2 percentage points of GDP in both the more- and less-developed countries. Retirement age increases should be accompanied by [adequate provisions for the poor, whose [life expectancy is shorter than that of the average population. * _Policies that affect demographics__ and labor markets'including migration_. Boosting fertility rates could offset population aging, but experience shows that public policies have limited ability to influence birth rates. On the other hand, raising migration from younger, less-developed economies to older, more-developed economies would relieve spending pressures, at least until migrants age and retire. This argument is being used in some European countries, especially Germany, in the context of ongoing refugee pressures. Increasing migration should not, however, be seen as a substitute for more fundamental reforms of entitlements. Countries could also consider measures that raise labor force participation rates'especially for women and older workers'to help mitigate the impact of aging: addressing gender differences in property rights, inheritance claims, and property titling; enhancing women's ability to pursue a profession, obtain a job, or open a bank account; and [enacting rights for women to initiate legal proceedings, sign a contract, and head a household. In addition, it is crucial to eliminate fiscal disincentives that might deter women from participating in the labor market, such as [taxation of households, which can raise marginal rates for second earners. Japan has lately embarked on such a policy. * _Better tax systems and more efficient public expenditure. _Many countries will find it impossible to fully offset the impact of demographics on age-related spending. These countries will need to strengthen their tax systems and generate efficiencies in public spending programs outside of pensions and health. [On the tax side, this could include widening the base for value-added taxes, strengthening taxation of multinational corporations, greater use of energy taxation to get energy prices right and account for environmental and other costs of energy use, better exploiting opportunities for recurrent property taxation, and strengthening tax compliance. [In regard to spending, countries could improve efficiency by reducing energy subsidies, improving public investment management, and rationalizing public sector wage bills, including in education. In sum, addressing the fiscal challenges of shrinking populations will require bold reforms, and countries are likely to choose varying solutions. Nevertheless, countries urgently need to rethink in a fundamental way what they can and cannot afford over the longer term. By undertaking reforms now, countries can address these issues in a more gradual and more politically palatable way.

The growth in the assets of their sovereign wealth funds, which were rising at a rapid rate until recently, is now slowing; some have started drawing on their buffers. In the short run, this phenomenon is not cause for alarm. Most oil exporters have enough buffers to withstand a temporary drop in oil prices. But what will happen if low oil prices persist, and how will policymakers react? We explore here the fallout from low oil prices on sovereign wealth funds in oil-exporting countries and find that that they have important domestic implications. The impact on global asset prices will depend on the extent to which the unwinding of oil exporters' sovereign wealth funds is not compensated by portfolio adjustment in other parts of the world.** ** [ **The rise of sovereign wealth funds**** ** In the early 2000s, high oil prices brought about a massive redistribution of income to oil exporters, resulting in current account surpluses and a rapid buildup of foreign assets. Governments established new sovereign wealth funds or increased the size of existing ones to help manage the larger pool of financial assets. [ The total assets of sovereign wealth funds are concentrated in a few countries. As of March 2015, it is estimated at $7.3 trillion, of which $4.2 trillion are oil and gas related. While there are large differences across sovereign wealth funds, available information on their asset allocation points to a significant share in equities and bonds. **Oil prices and the redistribution of global income** With high oil prices throughout the 2000s, the aggregate current account balance of exporters reached about $630 billion in 2011, exceeding that of emerging Asia combined. The current account surpluses of oil exporters are vanishing in 2015, however, and it is unlikely that this decline will reverse soon. On current projections, their combined current account balances could recover to about $200 billion in 2020. [ In contrast to the 2000s, the recent oil price drop [has been driven mainly by supply factors that may lead to a decoupling of the paths of asset accumulation between these two groups of sovereign wealth funds. The rate of asset accumulation by sovereign wealth funds in emerging Asia'mostly oil importers'is likely to rise but it will likely decline for the funds in oil-exporting countries. Of course, much will depend upon the strategic asset allocation choices made by the largest sovereign wealth funds in the low oil price environment. **Impact on global asset markets**** ** The [overall impact of the fall in oil prices on asset prices will depend, among other things, on whether oil importers have a lower marginal propensity to save than oil exporters. The fall in oil prices tends to transfer wealth from oil exporters to high-saving emerging Asian countries'but also to many other countries, including large advanced economies, some of which have a low propensity to save. From a global perspective, this implies lower global saving and higher interest rates. Precisely how much the savings of the sovereign funds of oil producers decline depends, of course, on changes in their fiscal and external current account balances. Sovereign wealth funds' market operations will also depend on how much their governments opt to borrow or draw on their fiscal buffers, including those kept with sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Arabia issued its first sovereign bonds since 2007 to local banks to finance its fiscal deficit. In addition, oil-exporters' sovereign wealth funds [are significant holders of U.S. treasury debt and private equity. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations show that, prior to the oil price decline, countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) alone were projected to have a combined fiscal surplus of about $100 billion in 2015 and of about $200 billion between 2015 and 2020, but are now likely to reach a combined deficit of $145 billion in 2015 and over $750 billion in 2015-20. This implies change in net assets available to sovereign wealth funds in the GCC alone of $250 billion in 2015 and $950 billion in 2015-20. Considering the expected tightening in U.S. monetary policy'especially against the background of concerns about market liquidity, increasing risk aversion, and falling reserve holdings by some emerging markets'a substantial change in the path of asset accumulation by sovereign wealth funds will likely have a direct effect on financial markets. A [study by economists at the Federal Reserve has shown that if foreign official inflows into U.S. Treasuries were to decrease in a given month by $100 billion, five-year Treasury rates would rise by about 40 to 60 basis points in the short-run, with a long-run effect of about 20 basis points. **Domestic implications** What does all this mean for the accumulation of sovereign wealth in oil- exporting countries, at least in the medium term? The low price environment is likely to test the relationship between governments in oil-exporting countries and their sovereign wealth funds. Absent cuts in public expenditures, governments will likely be transferring less revenue than before to these funds. At the same time, pressures to draw down on sovereign wealth funds' assets will probably rise. Among Middle East oil exporters, only the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Kuwait's fiscal buffers will last for over 25 years on current fiscal plans and oil price projections, according to our estimates. Bahrain and Yemen will exhaust them in the next two years, while most other countries will run out of buffers in four to seven years. Even though they'll still be able to borrow to finance their spending, governments of these oil-exporting countries would probably do well to tighten their belts if they hope to achieve the dual objective of sharing oil wealth equitably with future generations and economic stabilization.

We find that gender inequality is strongly associated with income inequality across time and countries of all income groups. **Gender and income inequality are linked** There are at least three reasons why higher [gender inequality is associated with higher income inequality: * **First**, gender wage gaps directly contribute to income inequality, and higher gaps in labor force participation rates between men and women result in inequality of earnings between sexes, thus creating and exacerbating income inequality. * **Second**, women are more likely to work in the informal sector, in which earnings are lower, which widens the gender earnings gap and exacerbates income inequality. * **Finally**, inequality of opportunities, such as unequal access to education, health services, and finance are prevalent between men and women, and are strongly associated with income inequality.** ** ** ****The evidence** Our study finds that gender inequality is strongly associated with income inequality across time and countries of all income groups, even after controlling for the standard drivers of income inequality, which include financial openness and deepening, technological progress and labor market institutions. We study the association between the two phenomena for almost 140 countries over the last two decades. Our study extends the United Nation's Gender Inequality Index, which captures both gender inequality in outcomes (labor force participation gap and share of female seats in parliament) as well as gender inequality in opportunity (education gaps, maternal mortality, and adolescent fertility). Our main finding is that an increase in this multi-dimensional index from zero (perfect gender equality) to one (perfect gender inequality) is associated with an increase in net income inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) of almost 10 points. While these results hold for countries across all levels of development, the relevant dimensions of gender inequality vary. For advanced countries'with largely closed gender gaps in education and more equal economic opportunities across sexes'income inequality arises mainly through gender gaps in labor force participation. In emerging markets and low-income countries, inequality of opportunity, in particular in gender gaps in education and health, appears to pose an obstacle to a more equal income distribution.** ** **** The evidence suggests that greater gender equity and increasing female economic participation are associated with higher growth, more favorable development outcomes, and lower income inequality. Given these strong associations, aspiring to equality of opportunities and removing legal and other obstacles that prevent women from reaching their full economic participation becomes an issue of macroeconomic relevance, on top of the strong human rights argument: A more level playing field would give women the option to become economically active should they so choose. This in turn would have beneficial macroeconomic effects.** ** **Policy makers should take multi-pronged approach**** ** A significant decrease in gender gaps will require work along many dimensions. The policy recommendations have been discussed in previous IMF work on gender and include: * **Remove gender-based legal restrictions. **Gender-related legal restrictions are prevalent in a number of countries and include legal impediments to women undertaking economic activities. [Previous work has found that equalizing laws boosts female labor force participation. Specifically, granting gender equity under the constitution could increase the female labor force participation by as much as 5 percent. * **Revise tax policies.** Fiscal disincentives for secondary earners can limit female participation, and are viewed as an important barrier in Germany. Replacing family-based taxation with taxation of individual incomes would eliminate disincentives for secondary earners, who are frequently women. This could encourage more women to join the labor force. * **Create fiscal space for priority expenditures such as on infrastructure and education. **In developing economies, better infrastructure in rural areas'for example, more access to water and improved transportation systems'can reduce the time women spend on domestic tasks and enable them to seek work outside the home. Evidence from India suggests that female labor force participation in India would rise by 2 percentage points with an increase in spending on education of 1 percent of GDP. * **Implement well-designed family benefits**. Better access to parental leave and high quality, affordable childcare will make it easier for women to seek employment. In order to boost female force participation in Japan, a number of measures have been put in place including expanding childcare leave benefits from 50 percent to 67 percent of salary and boosting childcare services by around \u00c2? million children by April 2015. **Redistribution is complementary to these gender-based policies** Nothing can substitute for gender-specific policies geared to reducing gender and income inequality. [Previous IMF work has shown that redistribution generally has a benign effect on growth, while lowering lower income inequality. However, in order to combat deeper inequality of opportunities, such as unequal access to the labor force, health, education and financial access between men and women, policy markers should focus on more targeted policy interventions.

Monetary Policy in Latin America During Fed Liftoff", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=10417", "content": " By [Carlos Caceres, [Yan Carri\u00c3\u00a8re-Swallow, and [Bertrand Gruss ( As the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to raise policy rates for the first time in almost a decade, Latin America is in the midst of a sharp downturn with unemployment on the rise. In this context, many central banks across the region have kept interest rates low to support economic activity. But can monetary policy stay that way as global rates rise? What will the Fed liftoff imply for the region? Our analysis in the [_Regional Economic Outlook: Western Hemisphere_ suggests the effects of the upcoming Fed rate increase should be manageable for the region, although local long-term rates could increase considerably if the U.S. term premium'the compensation sought by investors for potential losses due to interest rate or inflation risk'reverts to its precrisis average. Countries with flexible exchange rates and credible monetary and fiscal frameworks should be able to continue providing support by keeping short rates low where needed. **Following the Fed's lead or simply dancing to the same tune?** In the early 2000s, many Latin American central banks adopted inflation targeting regimes featuring exchange rate flexibility, in part to avoid the need to deploy policies that exacerbated economic downturns triggered by large external shocks such as the Tequila and Asian crises of the 1990s. But some argue that because of financial globalization, policymakers in small open economies cannot run independent or autonomous monetary policies, even under flexible exchange rate regimes. Indeed, interest rates around the world have tended to move in tandem, typically following U.S. rates. But global business cycles also tend to be highly synchronized, so the observed comovement in interest rates may reflect that central banks were reacting to similar conditions, rather than following the Fed. This distinction is particularly relevant in Latin America now, where many business cycles in the region are out of sync with the U.S. business cycle. To answer this question, we decompose the movements in domestic interest rates of 46 advanced and emerging countries into two parts. The first component reflects the central bank's efforts to stabilize output and inflation. The second is everything else, including other central bank objectives'such as moderating exchange rate movements due to financial stability or competitiveness concerns'or shocks that affect monetary conditions. We then ask to what extent this residual movement in domestic interest rates can be attributed to spillovers from global financial conditions, such as shifts in U.S. policy rates. The answer to this question will suggest how much monetary autonomy central banks really have. We find that once we control for domestic macroeconomic conditions, spillovers from U.S. rates are smaller than simple interest rate correlations. But they are still significant for some emerging as well as advanced countries, suggesting they do follow the Fed. In Latin America, spillovers are significant and relatively large in Mexico and Peru, suggesting that, even if their economies were out of sync with that of the United States, they would be less likely to deviate from the Fed's behavior. **The setting around the U.S. liftoff** But beyond what central banks can do to keep short-term rates in sync with domestic conditions, a lot of what may happen in the current juncture will depend on the nature of the factors driving U.S. interest rates'including, in particular, what happens to the term premium. Figure 1 shows the estimated impact of Fed lift-off on long-term interest rates in selected countries after one year. Under the baseline scenario, U.S. rates increase according to current market expectations embedded in futures contracts. As the market is expecting a very gradual hiking cycle in line with an improving economic outlook, the impact is expected to be small across Latin America. [ However, certain risk scenarios could cause larger impacts. For instance, the Fed could lift rates faster than markets currently expect. Alternatively, an unusually low term premium reflected in very low long-term U.S. interest rates could decompress. If this risk materializes, the impact on Latin American interest rates could be substantial'over 160 basis points in some cases'with important implications for government spending on debt service. While these scenarios are considerably less likely than the baseline, they are not unprecedented. In the case of a term premium decompression back to its precrisis average, movements this size have been observed several times since 2000, including in the months following the 'taper tantrum'\u009d episode of May 2013. **Flexible exchange rates and credible policy frameworks are key** An increase in domestic long-term rates may be unavoidable, but keeping shorter-term rates aligned with domestic conditions would certainly help. In that sense, our analysis suggests that the difference in spillovers across countries can be linked to policies and other characteristics (Figure 2). Exchange rate flexibility plays the key role in ensuring that the central bank can gear monetary policy to a greater degree towards stabilizing the domestic economy. But the strength of policy frameworks is also crucial. The credibility of the central bank's commitment to price stability, as well as the market's perception of fiscal vulnerabilities, are both important determinants of interest rate spillovers. [ Other factors can also help. For instance, financial dollarization substantially increases interest-rate spillovers, while an active use of reserve requirements'one part of the macroprudential toolbox'can help mitigate them to some extent.

Our editors deployed their pens and notepads and brought back these themes and highlights. **Growth** Trouble in [emerging markets, a lack of investment, and an uneven [global economic recovery weighs on the prospects for growth. One bright spot is the growing idea that greater access to financial services throughout a country's population, called [financial inclusion, can help [economic growth. [ Liliana Rojas-Suarez, Senior Fellow, Center for Global Development speaks during the flagship seminar Financial Inclusion: Can it Meet Multiple Macroeconomic Goals 'Countries with commitments to financial inclusion have economies that have grown stronger than those who haven't,'\u009d said Alfred Hannig, Executive Director of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. 'Countries with financial inclusion targets have grown 13.4 percent between 2011 and 2014, compared to 8.5 percent for those without.'\u009d While originally thought of as expanding peoples' access to credit, it now also includes payments, savings, and investment. Financial inclusion also can entail financial risks, and we'll get to those in a bit. Volatile [commodity prices, such as [oil and metals, were also a hot topic given how they complicate a country's growth and [fiscal policy. Predicting how long a boom or bust will last is difficult, so the idea is to save in the good years so you can spend in the bad ones. [ Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, speaks during the seminar Structural Reforms, Inequality, and Growth [Structural reforms, from deregulating telecoms to education investment and everything in between, are no longer an 'either or'\u009d proposition: they can boost growth and reduce inequality, with the right political and policy choices. Strong, transparent and accountable economic institutions are key to help a country deal with the ups and downs of the global economy, and with the growing new frontier of policy issues. The foundation of a strong institution is built on the skills of the people who work there, which is why [capacity building and training is the lynchpin to help make all this happen, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.** ** **Climate change, energy prices**** ** Speaking of [structural reforms, the policy choices and changes countries have to make to address [climate change, [energy pricing, and [energy subsidies were another topic up for debate. While each country will have to design the policy that best suits them, the IMF's Managing Director Christine Lagarde reminded everyone of their collective responsibility. [ CNN panel discussion on Climate Change 'If we chicken out of this we'll all turn into chickens and will be fried, grilled, toasted and roasted,'\u009d said Lagarde. Countries will have to muddle through designing energy prices to meet [climate change objectives, and some panelists thought advanced economies are not taking full advantage of the current low oil prices to address [energy prices and subsidies._ _ 'Finance Minister, go home, price it right, tax it smart, do it now,'\u009d said Lagarde. **Finance**** ** For a profession that some credit with saving the world from an even bigger global crisis that the one we got, central bankers were in an introspective mood. Whether from advanced, emerging or [low- income countries, what they have learned and what they need to understand better dominated the discussions against the backdrop of how long low interest rates in advanced economies like the United States would last. If you are a central banker these days, you do not want to bump into a tree while you're staring at the forest. Up for debate was how much to focus on price stability and if, when and how to broaden your view to include the risks to the [financial system as a whole. The case for using [monetary policy to contain risks to financial stability'known as leaning against the wind'remains open. Views ranged from yes, to no, and perhaps as a last line of defense. [ Raghuram Rajan, Reserve Bank of India, Governor speaks during the flagship seminar Financial Inclusion: Can it Meet Multiple Macroeconomic Goals Speaking of financial stability, it turns out that while [financial inclusion has a positive impact on growth, it also can have a negative impact on financial stability. If credit grows too quickly and new lenders are not properly supervised, risks will grow. New technology is both the boon and bane for the expansion of services and products, as well as risks. So how do policymakers keep an open mind to innovation, and regulate these new services to preserve financial stability? 'Let a variety of players enter, and ban only those we are certain will do harm,'\u009d said Raghuram Rajan, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and a former IMF chief economist.

Indeed, since our assessment in April, we have seen a significant deterioration in fiscal positions (measured by the primary balance) for emerging economies and for commodity exporting countries (Chart 1). And this has translated into higher levels of public debt. [ It is timely therefore that this issue of the _[Fiscal Monitor_ focuses on the conduct of fiscal policy under uncertainty, with particular attention to the uncertainty created by commodity price fluctuations. ** The rise and fall of commodity revenues** The recent sharp decline in commodity prices has reminded us that these prices are volatile and highly unpredictable. History tells us that commodity price booms and busts can involve prices moving by as much as 40 to 80 percent. Moreover, these movements can also be highly persistent. What we document is the fact that fiscal policy is key to the transmission of commodity price fluctuations to the rest of the economy. This occurs for at least two reasons. One, in countries where governments rely heavily on commodity revenues, commodity prices tend to cause large fluctuations in fiscal revenues. The second reason is that insulating government spending from volatile revenue has proved particularly difficult. As a result, spending in these countries has been strongly procyclical: increasing during price booms and falling during price busts. This time around is no different. The fiscal implications of the sharp decline in commodity prices are very large. The deterioration in the 2015 primary balance in commodity exporting countries is about 5 percentage points of GDP on average, with countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela experiencing a particularly sharp decline. This reflects a massive reversal of the revenue windfall that commodity exporters accrued during the boom years. About half of this windfall has been reversed so far (Chart 2). [ And not only are revenues weaker, but external financing conditions in commodity exporting countries have tightened, making it harder and more expensive to finance spending (Chart 3). Indeed, global financial markets are particularly unforgiving'financial conditions tend to worsen significantly precisely at times when commodity exporters need financing. [ Those commodity exporters that built buffers during the boom years or had easier access to capital markets, such as Chile, the Gulf countries, and Norway have been in a better position to support government spending. In many other countries, however, budgets are under stress. All commodity exporters will need to adjust public spending to lower commodity revenues, while safeguarding to the extent possible essential capital and social spending. The pace of adjustment will depend on the availability of buffers and market access. The latter crucially depends on the credibility of the fiscal framework. How about countries that are not commodity exporters? Fiscal balances in emerging market and low-income economies have also worsened, reflecting a combination of weak growth prospects and country-specific factors. More encouraging is that prospects in advanced economies remain broadly unchanged compared to April, as the modest recovery progresses broadly in line with earlier projections. But our long-standing warning about high public debt and its adverse economic impact remains very relevant. In advanced and in some emerging market countries debt levels have reached extraordinary levels, and'to make matters worse'these economies have huge future obligations from age-related spending. We estimate that health and pension spending will rise to 25 percent of GDP, by the end of the century, in advanced economies and 16 percent of GDP in less developed countries (Chart 4). We will present important new evidence of the fiscal implications of demographic trends at the end of the month in Tokyo. [ **How to thrive despite the wild ride** Given the magnitude of the challenges I just presented, the key question is: how can governments manage public finances to deal with these daunting long- term challenges, while also coping with the substantial near-term risks and uncertainties? The answer to this question, and one of the main messages of the _Fiscal Monitor_, is that the conduct of fiscal policy under uncertainty can be improved by adopting a robust and coherent risk management framework. And we believe that this framework needs to rest on four pillars: One, budget revenues should be mostly derived from broad-based taxation, backed by strong compliance. In the case of commodity exporters, more efficient revenue mobilization can mitigate revenue volatility. One specific aspect is the taxation of multinational corporations. These reforms can be part of the fiscal adjustment strategies that commodity exporters will need to pursue. Two, improving the efficiency of spending, including energy subsidy reform, continues to be a priority and can facilitate fiscal adjustment. That is also clearly the case in core areas for sustainable and inclusive growth such as public investment, health and education. Three, it is important to put in place fiscal frameworks that help countries save during good times so they can protect spending during bad times. In commodity producers, this saving has to strike the right balance between accumulating financial assets, investing in physical infrastructure, and investing in people through health and education spending. Moreover, it is essential to start now in implementing a more robust framework that can help countries deal with the uncertainty that lies ahead. And four, the quality of institutions is crucial. Fiscal rules and procedures are important, but they need to be underpinned by a broader social and political commitment to adhering to these rules and laws. These pillars are important for all countries, but they are especially crucial in resource-rich countries where the conditions for managing public finances are much more challenging. And the Fund remains committed to assisting its membership in building these pillars, not just in the analysis I am presenting today, but in the context of its regular policy dialogue with countries, and the extensive technical assistance we provide.

Our recommendation is for an urgent upgrade in policies, to avoid downside risks and to achieve our upside scenario of 'successful normalization'\u009d of monetary and financial conditions. This will secure financial stability and strengthen the economic recovery. Let me first provide you with our overall assessment for financial stability. How has it changed since our April _Global Financial Stability Report_? Here I have some good news. Financial stability has improved in advanced economies, as the economic recovery has broadened and solidified. The Federal Reserve has indicated that monetary policy lift-off is close in the United States as the economic preconditions are nearly in place. In the euro area the policies of the European Central Bank have gained traction and credit conditions are improving. However, as flagged in this and our [April 2015 report, risks have rotated toward emerging economies. Although many of these countries have enhanced their policy frameworks and resilience to external shocks, several face substantial domestic imbalances. Growth is slowing for the fifth year in a row, as the commodity super cycle and unprecedented credit booms have come to an end. This is of special relevance given the large share of emerging markets in the world economy, as well as the role that global markets play in transmitting shocks to other emerging markets and spillovers to advanced economies, featured in this summer's financial turmoil. **Policymakers therefore confront a triad of challenges** **First,** are emerging market vulnerabilities. Corporate and bank balance sheets are currently stretched: we estimate there is up to three trillion dollars in overborrowing in emerging markets. Higher leverage of the private sector and greater exposure to global financial conditions have left firms more susceptible to economic downturns, and emerging markets to capital outflows and deteriorating credit quality. China, in particular, faces a delicate balance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing high debt levels through an orderly deleveraging, and moving toward a more market-based system. This is a challenging set of objectives. **Second**, crisis legacies in advanced economies need to be addressed to consolidate financial stability and to reduce headwinds to growth. In the euro area, tackling sovereign and banking vulnerabilities, as well as filling gaps in the financial architecture remains critical. In the United States, embarking on the most-telegraphed, although unprecedented, process of increasing the policy rates for the first time in nine years is going to be an important transition for global markets. The **third** challenge is how global financial markets respond under strain. We have learned that markets can amplify shocks and act as a source of volatility and contagion when market liquidity is low. Indeed this report finds that market liquidity has become less resilient. This is all the more important given extraordinarily accommodative monetary policies that have contributed to compressing risk premia across a range of asset markets. In fact, risk premia could decompress in a disorderly way causing a vicious cycle of fire sales, redemptions, and more volatility. Leverage in investment funds also has the potential to amplify shocks. Our analysis found $1.5 trillion dollars in embedded leverage in bond funds through derivatives. These diverse challenges call for an urgent policy upgrade. What we want to achieve is a successful normalization of financial conditions and monetary policies together with a sustained economic recovery. But policy missteps and/or adverse shocks could result in prolonged global market turmoil that would ultimately stall the economic recovery, and result in what I call a 'failed normalization.'\u009d The difference between these two scenarios is quite stark, amounting to nearly three percent of global output by 2017. **So what urgent policies are called for? ** Monetary policies in key advanced economies must remain accommodative and responsive. Both the euro area and Japan will need to continue to counter downward price pressures. Amid more uncertainty in the global economy, the United States should wait to raise policy rates until there are further signs of inflation rising steadily, with continued strength in the labor market. The pace of subsequent policy rate increases should be gradual and well communicated. Euro area policymakers cannot rely on the European Central Bank alone, but must strive to complete the banking union to move financial stability onto firmer ground. It also needs to advance the capital markets union. Further strengthening of euro area banks by comprehensively tackling nonperforming loans and the corporate debt overhang will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, bolster market confidence, and improve the outlook. Resolving nonperforming loans in euro area banks could deliver about three percent of loans in new lending capacity. This amounts to around '\u00ac600 billion euros. Rebalancing and deleveraging in China will require great care. The Chinese authorities face unprecedented policy challenges in making the transition to a new growth model and a more market-based financial system. Deleveraging the corporate sector and enhancing market discipline will inevitably entail some corporate defaults, exits of nonviable firms, as well as write-offs on nonperforming loans, thus requiring a further strengthening of banks. Yet, moving decisively will ultimately prove less costly than trying to grow out of the problem. Building resilience and maintaining confidence in emerging markets will be crucial. Emerging markets need to get ahead of the credit cycle. With slower growth and rising corporate leverage, immediate prudential attention is needed to ensure the resilience of both corporates and banks. Furthermore, maintaining sovereign investment-grade status through appropriate measures is crucial. Managing any outbreaks in financial contagion will require nimble and judicious use of available policy buffers. Safeguarding against market illiquidity and strengthening financial market structures are priorities. Oversight of liquidity in the asset-management industry should be enhanced to avoid risk of fire sales and a rush for redemptions. A collective effort to deliver a policy upgrade is needed urgently to face up to rising challenges in an uncertain world, to ensure financial stability and better growth prospects. Three percent of global output is at stake.

[Our forecasts come at a moment when the world economy is at the intersection of at least three powerful forces. First, China's economic transformation ' away from export- and investment-led growth and manufacturing, in favor of a greater focus on consumption and services. This process, however necessary and healthy in the longer term, has near-term implications for China's growth and its relations with its trade partners. Second, and related, the fall in commodity prices. Years of high global demand drove prices upward and spurred investment in commodity sectors. But as China began to slow earlier during the present decade, many commodity prices turned downward, starting in the second half of 2011, and their fall has accelerated recently. Third, there is the impending normalization of monetary policy in the United States. Relatively favorable output and price performance in the United States could soon justify an interest-rate increase, but the possible global repercussions, especially in emerging and developing economies, add to current uncertainties. Amid these developments, we project that in the near term global growth will remain moderate and uneven, with higher downside risks than were apparent at our July 2015 update. The 'holy grail'\u009d of robust and synchronized global expansion remains elusive. **Disparate fortunes** What do the numbers say? Broadly speaking, these reflect a reduction from our forecasts of last July. Global real GDP grew at 3.4 percent last year, but will grow at only 3.1 percent this year. For 2016, we project a rebound to 3.6 percent growth. We have reduced both of these numbers by 0.2 percentage point compared with our last projections three months ago. The aggregate numbers reflect disparate fortunes between the advanced and the emerging market and developing economies. In advanced economies we project a moderate growth pick-up this year relative to last, notably in the United States and euro area. Unfortunately, Japanese growth seems to be faltering after a strong first quarter. Advanced economies grew at a 1.8 percent rate last year but we see a modest increase at 2.0 percent this year, then accelerating to 2.2 percent in 2016. As always, the figures for advanced economies in general mask diverse prospects across individual countries. Major commodity producers, notably Canada but also Australia and Norway, are experiencing slowdowns. Along with the fall in real incomes due to poorer terms of trade, there are also negative investment effects in the commodity-producing sectors, which have proved a significant headwind to growth even in the United States. But the downward trend in commodity prices, which, as I have noted, has accelerated recently, is having its most dramatic effects in the emerging and developing commodity exporters. For this group of countries'that now represents well over half of world GDP and will still generate the lion's share of world growth'2015 growth is projected to fall to 4.0 percent from its 2014 level of 4.6 percent. This rate of growth is much lower than what we saw in the recovery from the global crisis, and represents the fifth straight year of falling GDP growth for emerging and developing economies. Of course, while commodities are a big part of the story, they are not the whole story: in some cases, political instability could be a bigger factor, or an overhang of debt after capital inflows and over-investment earlier this decade. We project a rebound for next year, with 4.5 percent growth in emerging and developing economies, and a further pickup in subsequent years. This rebound mostly reflects an expected gradual normalization of conditions in countries experiencing especially deep recessions this year'such as Brazil and Russia'as well as in some other economies that are currently growing much below trend, including in Latin America. **Future risks to emerging and low-income countries**** ** To be sure, many emerging markets have increased their resilience to external shocks with increased exchange rate flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on Foreign Direct Investment flows and domestic- currency external financing, and generally stronger policy frameworks. That being said, we have recently become more worried about potential downside risks that may threaten this recovery'all the more so because some countries have limited policy space to respond. The new releases of the _Global Financial Stability Report_ and the _Fiscal Monitor_ cover financial and fiscal risks in detail. But some obvious concerns stand out. A notable risk is a rapid decompression of bond risk premiums, leading to spikes in longer-term interest rates. Indeed, we have already seen some of this increase for some emerging and developing economies, especially commodity exporters. Exchange-rate depreciation has generally been a helpful buffer for emerging and developing countries experiencing growth slowdowns'and has already been substantial'but could cause adverse balance-sheet effects where there is foreign-currency borrowing. Some countries have proactively tightened monetary policy to keep inflation expectations well anchored. **Needed: proactive policy management**** ** No single set of policy prescriptions is suitable for every country seeking to improve growth performance or build resilience. But some familiar general principles still apply. Emerging market and developing economies need to be ready for monetary policy normalization by the United States. Enhanced surveillance over financial vulnerabilities, as well as a further shift away from debt finance, especially foreign-currency financing, will be helpful preparations. Targeted capital flow measures could also play a useful role. Fiscal frameworks should be strengthened, with due attention to the needs to safeguard growth and to preserve social safety nets for the most vulnerable. Advanced economies must continue to deal with crisis legacies, including non- performing loans, where they persist. At the same time, monetary accommodation should continue where output gaps are negative, supplemented by fiscal measures where fiscal space permits. Deflation pressures remain in several regions. In many economies, whether advanced or not, the case for infrastructure investment seems compelling at a time of very low long-term real interest rates and concerns about low global demand. Higher investment is one way to enhance potential output growth, but targeted structural reforms can also play an important positive role. Such reforms help not only to enhance future growth, but to increase the resilience of growth. In conclusion, this _World Economic Outlook_ underlines the challenges all countries face; and it places even more importance on the policy upgrades that all require.

This process has been accompanied by a slowdown in imports and financial market volatility, raising reasonable concerns about the impact on the global economy, and particularly the spillovers to countries that have benefited most from China's rapid rise. It is important to understand, however, that the transition is essential if China is to create a more inclusive economy that gives greater play to market forces and achieves safer and more sustainable growth. This will involve a delicate balancing act for the Chinese government'implementing reforms while maintaining demand and financial stability. As reforms proceed, it will be critical to ensure effective governance of newly liberalized markets and enterprises. This will require, in particular, hardened budget constraints for both state-owned and private firms, and continued strengthening of the financial supervision framework. So far, developments in the real economy provide some comfort that the transition can be managed. The current pace of China's slowdown remains in line with the [IMF's forecast (and that of the authorities themselves), although downside risks have increased. This is based on the strength of infrastructure investment and consumption'particularly in services'even as activity has clearly weakened in manufacturing and construction. China has adequate policy space should further policy stimulus become necessary to prevent growth from falling excessively. The focus of such measures should target both demand and rebalancing (for example, by providing support for consumption, especially by the more vulnerable members of Chinese society). By contrast, it would be preferable to avoid the renewed use of debt-financed investment so as to prevent a resurgence of corporate leveraging. Since the Global Financial Crisis, growth in China has relied heavily on investment and credit, with the biggest buildup of leverage going to state-owned enterprises, the real estate and construction sectors, and weaker corporates. This created growing vulnerabilities which'while still manageable'cannot continue to accumulate. The dangers of excessive leverage have become clear in the stock market. Fueled by strong credit growth, which has since slowed down, stock markets surged by over 100 percent between November 2014 and this past June'only to correct by 40 percent in recent months. This correction was probably necessary, but it had significant global spillovers. The good news is that it is expected to have only a limited direct impact on the economy, given the low degree of share ownership by Chinese households and the low share of equity in corporate financing. The recent change in the exchange rate regime also had large ripple effects, particularly in Asia due to the uncertainty created by the move. However, the change in the exchange regime is consistent with the authorities' intention to move to a more market-determined exchange rate. Moreover, following a significant real appreciation over the past year, the renminbi has only depreciated by around 3 percent since the change. This does not alter the IMF's assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. While China's economy slows as expected, the country's size and integration into the global economy mean that its performance affects those around it. We have estimated that a one percentage point slowdown in Chinese growth translates into a 0.3 percentage point decline for other Asian countries. Such spillovers obviously are of concern, and recent experience suggests that spillovers to China's neighbors in Asia might have become even larger lately, coming not only through trade but also global financial market linkages. Spillovers have been magnified by forces that extend beyond China's border'including falling commodity prices and the prospect of an increase in U.S. interest rates'which could produce downward pressure on Asian neighbors. The bottom line is: vigilance must remain the watchword. For China, that means focusing on the downside risks, and for the rest of the world, guarding against potential spillovers. If managed well'including with clearer communication to help guide market expectations'China's transition could provide the basis for renewed economic strength in a region that has led the world in growth for several years.

When the U.S. Fed does eventually raise interest rates, the accompanying further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will mean an emerging market's own currency will depreciate against the higher value of the U.S. dollar, and would make it increasingly difficult for firms to service their foreign currency-denominated debts if they have not been properly hedged. In the latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_, we find that firms in emerging markets that have increased their debt-to-assets ratios have generally also increased their overall sensitivity to changes in the exchange rate'commonly called exchange-rate exposure. We measure this by estimating firms' exposure indirectly, based on the reaction of their stock returns to changes in the exchange rate. This estimate of foreign exchange exposure in principle accounts for financial hedges, such as swaps, and natural hedges, such as export-oriented firms' receipts in a currency other than their own, as well as local market conditions. We estimated these foreign-exchange exposures using data from thousands of individual publicly-listed firms. Estimating these exposures is advantageous because firm-level data on foreign currency holdings are generally unavailable. **Bonds do not tell the whole story** Various observers have pointed to the rise in foreign currency-denominated bond issuance by many emerging markets. Various papers, including [this one, have documented the rise in emerging market bond issuance in foreign-currency denominations; however, focusing on bonds is not enough to obtain a good picture of firms' overall foreign exchange exposures. * **First**, bank lending remains the most important source of financing for many firms, accounting for over 80 percent of corporate debt. * **Second**, firms may hedge currency risk using financial instruments such as swaps. * **Third**, overall foreign-currency exposure depends on other factors, such as the composition of firms' balance sheets, including their assets, and the nature of their business operations. For example, export-oriented firms' receipts in a currency other than their own, typically the U.S. dollar, can serve as 'natural'\u009d hedges against their debt obligations in foreign currencies, whereas firms importing inputs from abroad are naturally exposed to the risk of local currency depreciation. **Beg to differ** Our estimated foreign exchange exposures highlight differences across sectors. For example, firms in nontradable sectors, such as construction, tend to have positive foreign exchange exposures - that is, local currency depreciation affects them adversely. This reflects the fact that sectors like real estate tend to do well during periods of capital inflows and currency appreciations (Chart 1). In contrast, export-oriented firms, such as those in the mining sector, tend to have negative foreign exchange exposures, because they benefit from a depreciation of the local currency. [ The evolution of foreign exchange exposures after the global financial crisis also differs across regions (Chart 2). For instance, foreign currency exposures appear to have risen the most in Latin America, on average, after the crisis. [ Furthermore, outside of Asia'Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America'the fraction of firms with positive foreign exchange exposures increased across all sectors from 2010 to 2014 (Chart 3). [ We then compare the change in foreign currency exposures with the change in the debt-to-assets ratio for listed firms. Interestingly, the construction sector, where this ratio grew rapidly, is among the sectors perceived by stock markets as having strongly increased its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations since the crisis. These findings suggest that emerging markets must prepare for the implications of a continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar as the U.S. Fed begins to normalize monetary policy.

Growth among the six larger, financially-integrated economies'Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay'is expected to be negative this year. With heightened financial market pressures and limited policy space, the credibility of policy makers is being seriously tested. In this challenging environment, policy-makers in these six countries face some difficult questions: how to strike the right balance between smoothing the adjustment and strengthening credibility? What role should fiscal policy play in this new, uncertain and rapidly evolving environment? These and other questions will be addressed at the Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru next week. As we prepare for these meetings, we offer our thoughts on some of the pressing issues for Latin America. **Commodities at the center** During the boom years, the region benefitted from sustained high commodity prices. For instance, in the case of Chile, windfall gains to income owing to stronger terms of trade from the boom in commodity prices amounted to about 185 percentage points of GDP in cumulative terms over 2003-12, and almost half that in the case of Peru. This allowed countries to build fiscal buffers and to deploy counter-cyclical budgetary policies in response to the crisis. In the case of Chile, for example, the overall fiscal balance declined in the wake of adverse macroeconomic shocks, and discretionary stimulus (reflected by a 4 percentage points of GDP fall in the cyclically-adjusted balance over the period 2007-09) provided a significant cushion to the economy. The situation today is very different. First, the external environment is shifting, led by the sharp decline in commodity prices over the past few years. China\u00c2\u00b4s growth slowdown and economic rebalancing has translated into a significant deterioration in Latin America's terms of trade that is not expected to recover any time soon. At the same time, financial conditions are poised to tighten in the context of U.S. monetary policy normalization. The change in the external environment and the sharp regional slowdown has led to a sharp decline in Latin currencies, capital flows and equity prices and an increase in interest rate spreads. Second, the external shock has been compounded by domestic impediments. These vary by country, and include political imbroglio, low confidence, rising household and corporate leverage, as well as structural rigidities, such as limited economic diversification and lagging trade performance. Moreover, with some of the current headwinds being seen as permanent, economic agents are reassessing the strength of regional macroeconomic fundamentals and policy frameworks. All this, compounded with relatively low levels of investment and weak productivity growth, has translated into the slowest regional growth rates in a decade with longer-lasting adverse effects. Consequently, medium- term growth prospects have been marked down (Chart 1). [ In this environment, budgets are under pressure. Following a short rebound after the crisis, budget balances started to deteriorate as government spending in Latin America's six larger economies increased (by an average of 3 percentage points of GDP) while commodity prices were still relatively high. Now, the fall in commodity prices and the slowdown in growth have led to a fall in fiscal revenues. Overall, the fiscal deterioration has gathered pace alongside the worsening of the domestic environment and mounting external pressures. **Difficult choices lie ahead** Given the magnitude and persistence of the shock, adjustment is unavoidable. This said, many of Latin America's six larger countries will see negative output gaps in the short run. Therefore, a fundamental question is'what role should fiscal policy play in this new, uncertain and rapidly evolving environment? Is there scope for fiscal policy to play an active stabilization role? After all, counter-cyclical policies during the global financial crisis contrast favorably with many past episodes of crises and pro-cyclical policies in the region. Reality, however, is more complex and demanding. While the public debt outlook appears generally manageable in these six countries, the incomplete reversal of fiscal stimulus implemented in response to the crisis has significantly reduced fiscal buffers. Only Chile managed to close the structural deficit by 2012, but the deficit has deteriorated again since then. In addition, revenue policies have not kept pace with spending ([Celasun and others, 2015), which has either persisted at the elevated levels (Chile, Colombia, and Mexico) or risen further (Brazil and Uruguay) since the crisis (Chart 2). In addition, current outlays'such as pensions, social protection, and health'have also gone up in all countries except Peru and, to a lesser extent, Colombia, making the retrenchment of spending politically and socially difficult. Finally, fiscal risks stemming, for example, from state owned enterprises and the financial sector are a further source of fiscal vulnerability. [ Against this backdrop and the current juncture'when there are clear risks of capital flow reversals and credibility is at a premium'we would argue that the main role of fiscal policy in these six larger countries should be to anchor expectations and to facilitate adjustment. The desired size, timing, and pace of consolidation varies across countries, depending on the prospective debt dynamics, macroeconomic outlook, and market conditions. In Brazil, there is an urgent need to put debt ratios on a downward path. In Uruguay, the fiscal position should be strengthened over the medium term to reinforce fiscal sustainability. Colombia and Mexico face more moderate public debt burdens, but fiscal tightening will also be required to accommodate lower-than-expected revenues owing to weaker oil prices and slower potential growth. In Chile and Peru, where public debt levels remain well below that of other emerging markets, there is more room for a gradual adjustment, but their vulnerability to commodity price shocks underscores the importance of eventually adjusting to lower metal prices. **Anchoring policies ** Ultimately, how much fiscal latitude is available depends on confidence and credibility. From that perspective, it is imperative to maintain'and in some cases re-establish'fiscal anchors. The fundamental objective should be to ensure a solid financial position for the general government. Compliance with the rules and procedures that make up national fiscal frameworks is an important element to achieve this goal. The recent experience during the global financial crisis is mixed in that respect. In particular, despite a robust recovery taking hold after 2009, medium-term fiscal objectives were frequently revised and rules bent to various degrees (Chart 3). The difference this time around is that, with emerging markets facing heightened uncertainty, markets are sharply discriminating between countries with a long-track record of credibility and those where policy and political risks have accumulated in recent years (Chart 4). [ [ But let us also be clear, anchoring policies alone will not be enough to ensure long run prosperity. Going forward, it is crucial to build or maintain robust and resilient frameworks to deal with uncertainty. The importance of structural fiscal policies has long been understood. Already in 1576, Jean Bodin, a French jurist and political philosopher, enunciated three principles for the proper management of public finances: 'the first is honest means of raising revenue; the second is to employ them for the profit and honor of the state; and the third, to save some portion of them for time of need.'\u009d Commodity producers such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru should rely on a diversified revenue base and should, therefore, avoid an overemphasis of government spending on the resource sector. In addition, greater effort should be focused on bolstering public investment management and strengthening expenditure policies, to ensure that government spending plans are efficient and effective, which would, in turn, create fiscal space and generate growth dividends. Finally, the on-going commodities price roller-coaster underscores the importance of having fiscal frameworks that build sufficient precautionary buffers to deal with uncertainty (more on that in the forthcoming Fiscal Monitor, October 2015). Most countries in Latin America are at a difficult cross-roads. Experience from the 1990s and 2000s shows that they were able to adjust and implement structural fiscal reform despite unfavorable conditions. Once again, Latin America faces uncertain times and difficult choices.

Nonperforming loans as a share of total loans in the EU have more than doubled since 2009, reaching '\u00ac1 trillion'over 9 percent of the region's GDP'by end-2014. These loans are particularly high in the southern part of the euro area, as well as in several Eastern and Southeastern European countries. Only a handful of countries have managed to lower their nonperforming loan ratio to below its post-crisis peak. [ **Causes ** A [recent IMF study on the causes and consequences of persistently high nonperforming loans finds that the weak economic recovery is only part of the story and that the underlying reasons are often deep rooted. Notably, European banks are writing off their problem loans much more slowly than American or Japanese banks, despite a much higher stocks. Much of the inertia is due to shortcomings in supervisory and legal frameworks as well as the lack of well-developed distressed debt markets. A new survey of European country authorities and banks shows that deficiencies in the legal framework and underdeveloped distressed debt markets are, on average, seen as the most severe obstacles to resolving nonperforming loans. The challenges are generally even more daunting for countries outside the euro area. And the different obstacles are interlinked, with difficulties in one area compounding challenges in others. [ More severe structural obstacles are associated with worse nonperforming loan outcomes. Insufficiently robust supervision can allow banks to avoid dealing with large stockpiles of nonperforming loans and continue carrying them on balance sheets. Accounting rules tend to hinder timely loss recognition and inflate 'provisions'\u009d'the cash that banks are required to set aside to cover expected losses from bad loans. Weak debt enforcement and ineffective insolvency frameworks lower the recovery values of problem loans. And markets for distressed debt in Europe'with some notable exceptions'are still too small, preventing the entry of much needed capital and expertise. [ **Consequences** Persistently high nonperforming loans are a drag on economic activity**.** They tie up bank capital that could otherwise be used to expand lending, lower bank profitability and raise bank funding costs. By holding back lending, they also reduce the effectiveness of the European Central Bank's monetary policy. Nonperforming loans should either be written off as loans that are beyond recovery, or restructured in a way that gives viable debtors the breathing space they need. This would, in turn, help to advance corporate restructuring, and effectively channel credit to growing firms. **Solutions** Reducing nonperforming faster requires a comprehensive approach**. **Such a strategy would have three main pillars: [ * _First_, the European Central Bank and national regulators should strengthen bank supervision. International experience shows that swift recognition of loan losses is crucial to repairing bank balance sheets. Banks should be asked to develop comprehensive nonperforming loan plans and meet loan restructuring targets within a reasonable time. They should also be required to set aside more capital for nonperforming loans that remain on their books for too long, and adopt more conservative provisioning and collateral valuation to encourage swift resolution. * _Second_, reforms are needed to make bankruptcy regimes more efficient and debts easier to collect. There is currently enormous variation in legal frameworks across countries. For example, the average length of foreclosure proceedings in Italy is almost five years compared to less than one year in Germany and Spain. Shorter court procedures, stronger institutional frameworks and greater use of out-of-court mechanisms would increase collateral recovery values and therefore make it easier for banks to dispose of bad loans. And greater involvement of public creditors in resolving these loans is essential. * _Third_, active markets in distressed assets need to be developed. A liquid market can connect banks (sellers) with specialist investors (buyers) experienced in managing impaired assets. Often a publically supported asset management company may be instrumental in jump-starting such a market. Successful examples include the U.S. Resolution and Trust Corporation in the 1980s, those in Asia during the financial crisis and Spain's SAREB. This is a challenging reform agenda, but the potential pay-off is high, whereas delaying the resolution of problem loans increases the risk of stagnation.

Raphael Lam, [Xiaoguang Liu, and [Alfred Schipke ** ** (Version in [\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e5??)** ** China is moving toward a 'new normal'\u009d of safer and more sustainable growth. To this end, ensuring its labor market stays resilient will be critical. Reforms to contain vulnerabilities caused by buildup of credits may temporarily slow growth, and raise the unemployment rate, but supported through a strong safety net, these reforms will raise productivity, and facilitate more sustainable growth. Despite the slowdown of the past few years, however, China's labor market has remained resilient. Efforts to maintain labor market stability are paying off, helped by an expanding services sector. **Labor market conditions are holding up fairly well** Although high-frequency employment indicators in the purchasing managers' indices (PMI) showed signs of softening up to August 2015, labor market conditions appear to have held up well in the broader context, even as the economy slowed. Newly-created urban jobs reached 13.6 million in 2014, and the first half of 2015 saw an additional 7.1 million new urban jobs created'on track to reach the government's official target of 10 million new jobs for the year (Chart 1). [ While wage growth has been slowing, it remains about 8 percent in the first half of this year, largely in line with nominal GDP growth. And migrant and urban workers have been enjoying similar gains, while the official registered unemployment rate held steady at about 4 percent, as did the surveyed unemployment rate (at about 5.0-5.1 percent). **What has contributed to this resilience?** In the recent IMF working paper, [_China's Labor Market in the 'New Normal'\u009d_, we find that long-term trends, such as urbanization, tend to support employment growth. The expanding services sector is a key factor. It is usually more labor- intensive than other sectors, creating jobs for people from rural areas. Indeed, the sector accounted for close to 40 percent of the labor force and contributed to 48 percent of value-added in 2014, surpassing manufacturing. Less surplus labor from demographic changes such as labor force growth also reduces the pressures on employment. At the same time, unique features in China's labor market warrant special attention. Among these, the first two'migrant flows (that is, rural labor moving to urban centers), and continued and potentially increasing surplus labor, especially in large state-owned enterprises (SOEs)'might serve as buffers during economic slowdown, even though they also raise concern. The third, data shortcomings, simply makes an assessment of labor market conditions more challenging. * **_Rural'urban migrant flows_** are generally not fully reflected in unemployment data, but might have acted as a shock absorber. Migrant jobs, largely in low-skill industries, are usually more vulnerable to slower growth, while our empirical analysis shows that migrant flows are largely driven by growth, and the urban-rural income gap. They are key to understanding labor market dynamics in China. In fact, migrant flows grew more slowly in 2014 (year-over-year), in line with the growth slowdown (Chart 2). While this phenomenon contributes to labor market stability in the short term, if it persists, it may delay the transformation of the economy and corresponding increases in productivity and income levels. [ * **_State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are keeping workers formally employed,_** despite overcapacity, and weakening profitability, particularly in provinces that rely on heavy industries. While this can temporarily shield the labor market against shock, it could also weaken labor flexibility in the medium term, and hence the needed adjustment of the economy. The recent SOE reforms that envisages exits of nonviable SOEs, and which provides sufficient social safety nets, could facilitate labor market adjustments over the medium term. * **_Labor market data shortcomings_** make accurate, up-to-date assessment of labor market conditions difficult. Labor market data in China are known to be far from ideal. Key data series are available, but their coverage, frequency, and timeliness have significant limitations. Given the increasingly important role of labor market statistics for policymaking, their strengthening will be paramount, and the government is taking steps to improve them by expanding the coverage of surveyed unemployment to include all cities. **Continued reforms are key to resilience going forward** It is true that implementing reforms will likely slow near-term growth further. But will it pose risks to the labor market? Our analysis gives a clue. We think the risk is modest and would be worth taking. Our analysis suggests that, with steadfast reform implementation and medium'term growth staying around 6'6\u00c2? percent, net urban employment could stay near 10 million per year'meeting the government's current policy target. To be sure, stepped-up SOE reforms and adjustment in sectors with overcapacity would, in the near term, release excess labor, and push up the unemployment rate. However, this would facilitate structural transformation'including service sector expansion, and new investment in productive enterprise'toward a more sustainable growth path (Chart 3). Instead of maintaining employment levels in these industries, well-targeted, on-budget support to affected employees would facilitate the transformation while providing an effective social safety net. [ In contrast, as highlighted in the [2015 IMF report on China, delays in reform implementation would build up vulnerabilities, weaken long-term economic prospects, and potentially worsen unemployment over the medium term. The tradeoff is therefore obvious. Continuing reforms to a sustainable growth path are key to maintaining labor market resilience.

What Happens When More People Use Financial Services", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=10226", "content": " By [Ratna Sahay, [Martin Cihak, [Papa N'Diaye, [Adolfo Barajas, and [Srobona Mitra (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, [Espa\u00c3?ol, [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) A growing number of policymakers see financial inclusion'greater access to financial services throughout a country's population'as a way to promote and make economic development work for society. More than 60 countries have adopted national financial inclusion targets and strategies. Opening bank accounts for all in India and encouraging mobile payments platforms in Peru are just two examples. Evidence for individuals and firms suggests that greater access to financial services indeed makes a difference in investment, food security, health outcomes, and other aspects of daily life. Our study looks at the benefits to the economy as a whole. [We find there are economic benefits to greater [financial inclusion, up to a point, and countries need high quality banking supervision when they broaden access to credit. **Tangible benefits from inclusion** Evidence on the macroeconomic effects of financial inclusion is scarce. Do living standards significantly improve, or is financial inclusion only a drop in the bucket? What are the [growth and stability trade-offs of financial inclusion? Are there risks that financial inclusion leads to '[too much finance\"? India's microcredit crisis and the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis are examples of instability fueled by easier credit access. Our study examines the macroeconomic dimension of financial inclusion using comprehensive global data from the [Financial Access Survey, [Global Findex, and other new datasets. The results suggest that there are tangible economic benefits, such as higher GDP growth from expanding financial inclusion. Looking at the data, what does financial inclusions's track record tell us? **Mind the gap** The world has seen improvements in financial inclusion, but considerable gaps remain. The percentage of adults with bank accounts increased from 50 to about 60 percent worldwide between 2011 and 2014. However, some two billion adults remain 'unbanked'\u009d. Furthermore, out of the banked population, almost 40 percent do not effectively use their accounts, either to make deposits or withdraw money. These trends mask persistently large differences across countries, regions, individuals, and firms. While inclusion is high in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, with a banked population of over 90 percent, it is markedly lower in developing countries, at 54 percent, and particularly so in South Asia and the Middle East. Worldwide, men are five percent more likely to own accounts than women, and nine percent more likely in developing countries. Survey data also show that small firms are considerably more likely to feel credit-constrained than their large counterparts, by some ten percentage points. We provide new data underscoring that the gender gaps are even larger in bank leadership and supervision than they are on the user side of financial services. Women hold less than 20 percent of bank board seats and represent less than two percent of bank CEOs. The share of women in banking supervisory boards is also low, at about 17 percent on average. **Impacts on growth, stability, and inequality** [Our analysis finds that the various types of access'accounts, credit, infrastructure, women users, low-income'improve economic growth, but up to a point. These growth benefits are in addition to those derived from increasing financial depth. Earlier studies have found'with some qualifications'that countries have achieved higher growth rates with deeper financial systems. Our analysis shows that financial inclusion provides an additional growth boost once depth is accounted for. However, the benefits fall as both financial access and depth become large. Our study also shows that the effects on financial stability of broadening access to credit depend on the quality of a country's financial supervision. We assess the quality by taking country scores on the Basel Core Principles of Banking Supervision, assessed in the IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Programs. When supervision is of high quality, broadening credit access leads to an increase in financial stability, as the banking sector builds up healthy capital and profit buffers. When supervision is of low quality, these buffers decline as credit access broadens (see figure). These results hold for economic stability as well. This presents a dual challenge for many countries, since we also find that supervisory quality tends to be deficient precisely in countries where financial inclusion is most lacking. [ In contrast to credit access, financial stability does not significantly deteriorate with other forms of financial inclusion, such as access to bank accounts, branches, and ATMs. Our results suggest that countries can expand these services without impeding financial stability. We also find that gaps in financial inclusion are associated with economic inequality, but the association appears relatively weak. In a nutshell, financial inclusion can help achieve several macroeconomic goals. However, there are limits to what it can do, and its benefits diminish as both financial access and depth become large. In particular, broadening access to credit can compromise stability if supervision is weak.

Winners and losers in a 'tale of two commodities'\u009d may one day look back with similar reflections, as prices of metals and oil have seen some seismic shifts in recent weeks, months and years. This blog seeks to explain how demand ' but also supply and financial market conditions ' are affecting metals prices. We will show some contrast with oil, where supply is the major factor. Stay tuned for a deeper analysis of the trends in a special commodities feature, which will be included in next month's [World Economic Outlook. **Metals matter** Base metals ' such as iron ore, copper, aluminum and nickel ' are the lifeblood of global industrial production and construction. Shaped by shifts in supply and demand, they are a valuable weathervane of change in the world economy. There is no doubt about the direction of the prevailing wind for metals in recent years. Prices have been gradually declining since 2011 (chart 1). While oil prices have also dropped, the decline is more recent (prices peaked in 2014), and more abrupt. That said, in both cases the downward pressure on prices result broadly from abundant production from the era of high prices. This is now coming home to roost with lower demand from both emerging markets and advanced economies. There are important nuances however in the relative strength and nature of those forces. [ **Appetite for production** In the early 2000s, demand for metals shifted from advanced economies in the West to emerging markets in the East. China, by far the main driving force, now accounts for half of global base metal consumption (chart 2). Compare that with China's more modest consumption of 14% of the world's oil which is almost exclusively used for transportation. [ It is therefore no surprise that metals prices are heavily influenced by demand, and the needs of one economic giant in particular. India, Russia and South Korea have also increased their metal consumption, but remain far behind China. The slower pace of investment in China in the last few years, however, compounded by concerns over future demand amid the sharp stock market decline and currency devaluation this summer, have been exerting downward pressure on metal prices. **Oil supply glut** Oil prices tell a different tale. Our view is that supply factors are playing a bigger role than demand. See also our [blog from last December. OPEC's decision to maintain its level of production and strong shale oil production in the United States ' in addition to the large production capacity from earlier investment ' have contributed to an unprecedented supply glut. Add to that: the prospect of Iran increasing oil production following the nuclear deal; Congress possibly lifting the US ban on crude oil exports and Libya and Iraq beating many analysts' expectations for production, despite their difficult geopolitical contexts. With slowing demand from emerging markets and advanced economies, we are more likely to see an era of much lower prices than we have seen in the past few years. **Hooked on metals** While we have highlighted changes in demand, supply also matters in the metals story. Global production has increased across the board for most metals, owing to rapid investment in capacity in the 2000s (chart 3). [ Such resource wealth can be a boon to developing countries, but it can also pose macroeconomic challenges if it accounts for a large portion of their exports. Fluctuations in prices or changing demand from large importers such as China imply obvious vulnerabilities. Over the last decade, many developing countries have seen their dependence on metals exports deepen. Metals account for more than half of the total exports of Mauritania, Chile, and Niger, for example. F**inancial market conditions** Beyond supply and demand, a third factor has been influencing short-run fluctuations in commodity prices. Investors can suddenly move away from what they perceive to be riskier bets, including stocks and commodities. This so- called 'risk off'\u009d behavior has at times put downward pressure on prices of both oil and metals. The sell-off on August 24 is a clear example. Initially oil prices recovered, then metals also rebounded significantly (chart 4.)_ _ [ **The next chapter** Just like a Dickens plot twist, the next moves of metal prices cannot be predicted with certainty. Futures markets clearly point to continued low prices. But it is helpful to go beyond futures and review the forces underpinning demand and supply of metals. On the demand side, the Chinese economy is projected to slow further, gradually, but with considerable uncertainty. Our simple analysis finds that 60 percent of the variance in metal prices can be explained by fluctuations in China's industrial production (chart 5). Recent further falls in Chinese industrial production could justify further metal price declines, especially considering the intended rebalancing that is shifting away from investment toward consumption. The change in the composition in China's growth may disproportionately affect metals compared to oil for reasons including the decline in the construction sector and the rising demand for transportation from the growing middle class. [ On the supply side, investment in the metals sector has dropped but it is unlikely that it will lead to a significant price rebound in the near future. Indeed low energy prices have helped with reducing costs for mining and refining including for copper, steel and aluminum. We also continue to discover more and more major mines outside advanced economies, which will add to global supply. Indeed, the frontiers of metals extraction have been expanding to Latin America and Africa over the past decades and that is unlikely to reverse significantly. If anything, improvements in the investment climate, which drives investment in exploration and extraction, are likely to steadily continue in these regions. Ample supply is therefore likely to continue pushing metal prices further down. **Bottom line****_ _** While both oil and metals prices are currently relatively low, there are importance nuances in the underlying driving factors behind the fall. All in all, the balance between weaker demand and steady increase in supply suggests that the metals market is likely to see a continued glut and a 'low for long'\u009d price scenario. If this turns out to be true, there is a risk that investment will continue to falter and lead to a sharp increase in prices down the road.

Japanese-brand cars have become everyday, household items in the United States, and it's hard to drive in the country without seeing one on the roads. These cars may be manufactured by Japanese firms, but about 70 percent of these vehicles are actually produced in North America. Globally, in 2014, about two-thirds of Japanese cars were produced on assembly lines outside of that country. Despite the increase in overseas demand for Japanese vehicles, this hasn't been mirrored by an expansion in investment, and the building of factories in Japan to meet that demand. Against this background, our[ IMF Working Paper looks at possible reasons for this sluggish recovery of corporate investment in Japan, focusing on the role of Japanese firms overseas. Since the Bank of Japan embarked on quantitative and qualitative easing in April 2013, the profitability of Japanese firms has improved, with both return on assets, and return on equity rising to levels comparable to those during the previous boom period in the mid-2000s (Chart 1). [ However, the recovery in corporate investment remains subdued, in particular for large firms whose investment has been largely flat over the last few years. Considering how closely corporate investment shadowed profitability during previous cycles, the recent slow recovery in corporate investment is exceptional (Chart 2). [ One notable feature of Japanese firms over the past decades has been the increase in offshore production, briefly interrupted by the global financial crisis. Over the last two decades, Japanese firms have expanded abroad to exploit cheaper labor, and rising demand in host countries. Overseas investment grew at a rate of 7 percent in the mid-1990s and 12 percent in the mid-2000s before the global financial crisis (Chart 3). [ The pace has accelerated, partly due to the appreciation of the Japanese Yen during the crisis, and uncertainty about energy supply after the 2011 earthquake. As a result, overseas investment now accounts for about 25 percent of total manufacturing investment, while domestic production capacity has declined by about 4 percent since 2011. Accordingly, exports by Japanese subsidiaries located overseas (to countries excluding Japan) exceeded exports from Japan by more than 40 percent. Empirical studies find that profitability, cash flow, and leverage are all important factors for the overall investment behavior of Japanese firms. However, for large firms, in particular those which have expanded production abroad, domestic profitability is less important as a factor driving their investment. Instead, cash flow is gaining in importance, although these large firms are less constrained by liquidity than other businesses. As overseas operations are riskier by nature from the perspective of financial intermediaries, external financing is more costly for overseas investment, and firms have to count more on internal financing for overseas expansion. Consistent with this, investment by firms in the transportation sector, which account for about 60 percent of overseas investment, depends more on cash flow and less on profitability for their investment decision. With structural reforms implemented under the third arrow of Abenomics yet to substantially boost domestic confidence, and improve the domestic demand outlook, the increase in overseas production continues to weigh heavily on domestic investment. Together with headwinds from an aging population, this trend constitutes a larger-than-expected drag on domestic investment'although Abenomics substantially improved financial conditions, including through the sharp depreciation of the yen. So, more ambitious structural reforms will be needed to provide a robust, long-term outlook and underpin near-term demand.

In our [new paper, we show that tax reform can go a long way towards meeting those aspirations. Taxation is a critical interface between the state and citizens. How much revenue is raised, how the tax burden is distributed, and how taxation is implemented can all powerfully affect both the reality and the perception of economic opportunities'and the degree of trust in government. Tax systems vary greatly across the countries of Middle East and North Africa: some have diverse and developed tax systems (oil importers and Algeria, Iran, and Yemen); in others, tax revenues come mostly from oil (essentially oil exporters). In both cases, however, there is a lot of room to improve fairness for both individuals and business through taxation. **Tax design: A conduit for greater fairness in diversified tax systems** In many of these countries tax systems are well established but their application is often arbitrary, and tailored to benefit the privileged. For example, the highest personal income tax rate is often low and applied to incomes so high that almost no one is affected; as a result, the wealthy may not pay their fair share, relative to the burden shouldered by the middle class. Corporations face tax rates comparable to those in other regions, but in many countries privileged companies are let off the hook through non- transparent and often arbitrarily applied exemptions. Value-added taxes (VATs) also suffer from exemptions, with the additional complication of a multiplicity of rates. Finally, burdensome tax administration is associated with unfair treatment of citizens and businesses (Chart 1). [ What can be done? Key changes in the design of tax systems can make a big difference'improving fairness, creating a more level playing field for businesses, and reducing opportunities for arbitrary application of tax laws. Our paper proposes to: * Simplify tax structures by consolidating multiple VAT rates and reducing the number of tax rates paid by corporations. * Widen the base on which taxes are collected by eliminating corporate income tax exemptions, and reducing and better targeting those for VAT. * Increase progressivity of personal income taxes, with three-to-four tax rates that rise with income, and apply to all income types (e.g. not only salaries but also investment income) so rich households pay their fair share. * Introduce or better design and enforce taxes on real property. * Make tax and customs administration more user-friendly by improving 'customer service'\u009d and simplifying codes and regulations. **Starting off on the right foot: Creating a fair tax system in countries dependant on oil revenues** Oil exporting countries, dependent on revenues from oil, have not had much need to introduce other taxes. But the possibility of persistently low oil prices is changing this perspective, as many countries have already lost their ability to coast along on a cushion of oil revenues. Broadening the tax system would be important not only to raise revenues, but also to support longer-term economic diversification. These countries could begin gradually with a 'starter pack'\u009d comprising a low- rate VAT, profit taxes applied to all resident companies, excises, and property taxes. Simultaneously, they could build administrative capacity and taxation expertise. And, as a key building block towards fairness in any modern tax system, they could start planning for a broad-based and effective personal income tax. **It's going to take political will****_ _** All this may sound easy in theory, but the reality is that there will be much resistance to these reforms. Policymakers, across the Middle East and North Africa, will have to tackle vested interests, build broad-based support, and reform tax administrations that may have little appetite for change. Effective communication, transparency, and a constructive dialogue between the state and citizens will be critical to the success of tax reform.

High commodity prices combined with strengthened economic management and progressive social policies to propel the region forward. This strength was all the more striking against the backdrop of the 2008'09 global financial crisis, which mired many advanced economies in recession but saw emerging markets, including many in Latin America, power ahead. This led some observers to dub the period the 'Latin American decade.'\u009d Now, as the world's economic leaders prepare to gather in Lima, Peru, in October for the [Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the picture looks quite different.

These businesses often find it impossible to recruit the workers they need. According to recent statistics, for each job seeker in Japan applying to work as a waiter, there are more than three available positions. Home helpers and long-term caregivers are equally in demand. If you want to work as a security guard, you can choose from around five openings, and for some positions in the construction business the job-to-applicant ratio is over six. Japan's labor shortages are the result of both a shrinking population'which limits the overall pool of workers'and skill mismatches. The reduced supply of labor is one of the factors bringing down medium-term potential growth, which the International Monetary Fund estimates at just 0.6 percent. Labor market shortages are also bad for short-term growth, because they reduce the effectiveness of the monetary and fiscal stimulus that the authorities are using to try to boost demand. Japan's shortages are large from an international perspective. The ratio of job vacancies as a percentage of the labor force population'an indicator of labor shortages'stood at 3.2 percent in 2013 in Japan. The same figure is 1.1 in Germany and 2.5 in the United States. [ Against this background, our recent [research paper looks at possible policy solutions. These include: * Moving toward more capital intensive technologies by increasing investment * Attracting more workers into the labor force by increasing wages * Increasing labor supply from under-represented demographic groups * Training, and other active labor market policies * Increasing the supply of foreign labor In several of the above areas, [progress is underway. Ongoing corporate governance reforms, for example, are expected to encourage investment, and the recent increase in female and elderly labor participation can help reduce shortages. Current efforts to encourage wage growth, for example through the Tripartite Commission, can also help attract more workers in the labor force. In addition, Japan could consider further deregulation, and devoting more fiscal resources to active labor market policies. Increasing the supply of foreign labor, however, has received less attention in the policy debate, even though there seems to be scope for it. Low historical immigration rates are reflected in the fact that Japan's reliance on foreign labor is only 0.3 percent'the lowest among advanced countries. [ The current growth strategy'the so-called 'third arrow'\u009d of Abenomics'includes some measures to increase foreign labor supply: * Relaxing immigration requirements for highly skilled foreign workers * Plans to allow foreign domestic helpers to work in Special Economic Zones * Plans to allow businesses to bring foreign employees to Japan for short-term training While these measures go in the right directions, they will have only a limited impact in reducing labor shortages, particularly in the most severely-hit sectors such as construction, security guards, services, and nursing. Drawing on the experience of other countries, Japan could consider some additional steps to attract more foreign workers, such as introducing guest worker programs, and loosening entry requirements in sectors with labor shortages'including for lower-skilled jobs. Japan could move in the direction of policies adopted by other countries, such as Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, which use quota systems aimed at making decisions on admission of foreign workers on the basis of economic needs. It could also consider allowing certain industries'as the mining sector in Australia does'to enter into direct agreements with the government to fill labor shortages. Introducing a uniform and comprehensive qualification framework to perform skill accreditation would also help. One possible political obstacle to expanding the foreign labor supply is the fear that the social costs of immigration will outweigh the benefits. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a widespread fear, but there are very few official estimates. One study by [Iguchi, suggests that, in the case of temporary immigration, the fiscal benefits would be larger than the costs for Japan assuming the foreign workers stay in Japan only temporarily. In addition, according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development opinion polls, attitudes toward immigration in Japan are broadly in line with those in other OECD countries. This suggests that the obstacles to introducing a temporary guest workers program, such as that found in other advance countries, are not insurmountable.

Six Central and Eastern EU members ' Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania ' are yet to do so. In the meantime, these countries have a decision to make: Should they opt in to the Banking Union before adopting the euro? Such a move may offer greater insurance against shocks, but at a certain cost to policy flexibility. In a [recent study, we explore some of the trade-offs that countries need to [weigh. **Banking Union origins ** **Rationale**: The recent crisis led to the realization that a common currency area needed centralized bank supervision and resolution to overcome financial fragmentation and break the link between bank and sovereign stress. **Elements****: **The two main arms of the Banking Union are the _Single Supervisory Mechanism_ and the _Single Resolution Mechanism_. The first aims to raise the credibility and quality of bank supervision by removing the distinction between home and host supervisors. The second aims to sever the links between bank and sovereign stress by unifying the bank resolution and restructuring frameworks across countries and providing a common, industry-funded backstop. The other two elements ' a common fiscal backstop and common deposit insurance ' are also essential to complete the Banking Union. **Benefits****:** Once the Banking Union is complete, it is expected to raise the quality of supervision, lower bank compliance costs, remove existing barriers to cross-border banking activity, lower resolution costs, and ultimately, lower bank funding costs. **Missing pieces** **Not all key elements of the Banking Union are yet in place. **With the SSM and SRM now operational, an effective common fiscal backstop is still needed to break the sovereign-bank links. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is currently acting as _de facto_ common fiscal backstop for euro area banks, but its powers are limited and the threshold for access is high. The industry-financed Single Resolution Fund (SRF) will be fully funded and mutualized only by 2024. Finally, there is still no pan-European deposit guarantee scheme. [ **Different rules ** **Non-euro area members of the Banking Union would not be treated in the same way as the euro area members. **Non-euro area countries are not members of the European Central Bank's (ECB) Governing Council, which is charged with adopting decisions drafted by the SSM. Further, non-euro area opt-ins will not be eligible for direct bank recapitalization by the ESM and would not have direct access to the ECB liquidity facilities.**_ _** [ **Trade-offs ** The calculus of the Banking Union opt-in decision for non-euro area members is complex and there are many moving parts. One way to look at it is whether the support they would get from the Banking Union makes it worthwhile to shift decision powers from the national level: * **LESS national policy flexibility vs. COMMON insurance**. At present, local supervisors have significant flexibility to impose macro- and micro-prudential requirements and use early intervention powers to mitigate shocks affecting financial stability and credit provision. Upon joining the Banking Union, some of this flexibility could be lost. This loss could be mitigated by having access to common insurance ' fiscal, industry-funded, and deposit insurance backstops. However, some of these are not yet in place or not available to non-euro area BU members. * **LESS national control over cross-border flows vs. COMMON liquidity backstop. **Banking Union membership would limit the local authorities' ability to ring-fence the euro area banks' subsidiaries. This is important for the new EU member states, whose banking systems are dominated by the euro-area owned banks which are systemically important in the host countries but account for a small part of the parent bank balance sheets (see Figure). Having less control over cross border flows in times of stress could be compensated by having access to common liquidity backstop. The latter, however, is not available to the Banking Union opt-ins. * **LESS national control over bank resolution vs. COMMON resolution fund.** Upon joining the Banking Union, decisions on whether or not to resolve a bank would be taken at the Banking Union level. Having less control over resolution decisions could be compensated by having access to a common backstop. However, until the SRF is fully mutualized, financing of the resolution process will remain largely a responsibility of individual countries. [ **Decisive factors ** The cost-benefit analysis could lead to different conclusions for different countries, depending on their fundamentals. It may be the case for some countries that an immediate boost to the quality and credibility of bank supervision and eventually having access to larger backstops would outweigh all other considerations. For others, the attractiveness of early opt-in will likely hinge on the Banking Union's ability to establish a fully equivalent treatment of euro area and non-euro area members, as well as its credibility and operational excellence.

Policymakers look at a number of indicators to guide them in assessing an economy's level of activity relative to its productive capacity. But trying to figure out the position of the economy in real time is often quite challenging, with consequences for setting policy. In the case of Brazil in 2011, for example, policymakers estimated in real time that the economy was at a level of output consistent with its productive capacity. Over time, however, the assessment of the cyclical position of the Brazilian economy changed drastically. It had not just been at full capacity, but was overheating. The economy was actually facing inflationary pressures, requiring policy tightening to bring it back to the central bank's target. [ While striking, this experience is not unique to Brazil. In a [recent study, we look at the implications for setting monetary policy in real time for a large set of countries, including five Latin American economies (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). **Output gap: important yet unpredictable**** ** Imagine an economy operating at full productive capacity and a sustainable level of employment consistent with low and stable inflation. In other words, everything is in perfect balance, economically speaking. Economists refer to the amount an economy can produce in this state as potential output. Because it is not directly observable, potential output is difficult to measure. Nevertheless, it is useful to estimate it to serve as a benchmark against the actual state of the economy. This difference between actual and potential output plays a crucial role in macroeconomics. If actual economic activity is below what the economy can produce at its capacity, stimulative policies (such as lowering interest rates) would normally be put in place to return the economy to potential. Conversely, more restrictive policies would be in order if actual activity is above potential output, to reduce overheating risks that could lead to a sudden, sharp downturn. A common measure of actual versus potential is the output gap, which is actual gross domestic product relative to its potential level at full productive capacity. Thus, a positive output gap signifies gross domestic product above potential and a negative output gap means there is excess capacity. Economists typically revise their estimates of the output gap to account for new information, so the gap for any given year can change after its initial estimate. This has significant implications for setting policy. By examining revisions to initial estimates of the output gap, the magnitude of uncertainty surrounding potential output becomes apparent: * Compared to initial estimates, nearly a third of assessments of output relative to potential reach the opposite conclusion based on subsequent information. * In real time, economists tend to think slowdowns are temporary in nature, but they are frequently longer-lasting, which only becomes apparent after the fact. Thus, an economy's potential productive capacity tends to be persistently overestimated. * Estimates of output gaps are less reliable in recession years, precisely when they are needed the most to enact sound countercyclical policies. * A low share of the variation in output gap revisions can be predicted ahead of time, making it difficult for policymakers to adjust for this uncertainty when policies are set. **To ease or to tighten, that is the question**** ** Most central banks set monetary policy according to the information they have in that moment regarding the position of the economy with respect to potential output, and the outlook for inflation. When inflation is expected to fall below target, policymakers can lower interest rates to stimulate growth and bring inflation back up; they can prevent overheating and rein in rising inflation expectations by doing the opposite. Therefore, when formulating monetary policy, it is crucial for central banks to know where economic activity is relative to its potential, especially when operating with a target for inflation. Since Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have all adopted such targets in the past few decades, we use them as case studies. * First, we find that if we use revised estimates of the output gap to emulate central banks' monetary reaction functions, interest rates set by central banks turn out to be substantially different from those that were set in real time. * Second, we find that these output gap revisions explain almost half of deviations between the actual level of inflation and the central bank's target. This suggests that output gap revisions bring to light new information that is not accounted for in policy decisions. This occurs, at least in part, because it is difficult to distinguish in real time whether fluctuations in economic activity are cyclical or the start of a change in the trend. [ These results underscore the challenges policymakers face when using policy rules that depend on an assessment of the economy's cyclical position to set the value for interest rates. Policymakers consult a large set of indicators but continue to have difficulties in distinguishing between cyclical fluctuations and shifts in the trend rate of growth. This results in instances where policy would likely have been different if they had known then what we know now. Looking forward, policy should not be so quick to attribute all movements in economic activity to short-term fluctuations; movements in the trend rate of growth are common and need to be adjusted to more quickly by policymakers. Methods for the real-time assessment of output relative to productive potential also need to be improved. These steps would help illuminate an aspect of making economic policy that is often like trying to find the light switch in a dark room.

Sayeh and [Abebe Aemro Selassie If, as has been observed, demography is destiny, this will be the African century. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are on the cusp of a demographic transition'the years when the share of young and old in the population declines and those in working age range (15-64 years) increases. Elsewhere, this transition has generally been accompanied by higher savings, incomes, and economic growth. Our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook for sub- Saharan Africa_ looks at how the transition might play out and the implications for economic policies. What we found striking is the truly global dimension and consequences of the demographic trends underway in the region. Consider the following: * By 2030 or so, sub-Saharan Africa's contribution to the increase in global labor force will exceed that from the rest of the world combined (Chart 1). * This is forecast to occur in the context of a marked decline in the number of entrants into the working age range globally, from around 2 percent annually between 1980-2000 to 0.5 percent or so for 2030-2050 (Chart 2). [ [ **_The global dimension_****_ _** As global economic growth continues to disappoint, the extent to which many advanced and some emerging market countries have benefitted from demographic tailwinds over the past several decades is becoming clearer. Conversely, as populations age and labor force participation rates decline in these countries, both potential and actual growth look set to be adversely impacted in the years ahead. To be sure, the drag on growth is modest and can be offset by policies and, indeed, higher productivity growth. Still, the fact remains that for the economies accounting for over 60 percent of current global GDP (G7 countries, China and Russia), the working age population had peaked by 2010. It stands to reason then that the global economy would benefit greatly from integrating Africa's labor force into global supply chains. Indeed, given the aging population for much the rest of the world, there may be little alternative. This issue is something that needs to move up to the top of the agenda in the international economic discourse, in both the private and public sectors. **_The regional angle_** The ongoing demographic transition offers a huge opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa. The increasing share of working age population provides a direct channel for increasing per capita incomes, as more workforce employed implies greater economic output and labor income per household. However, much of the demographic dividend will also depend on the quality of economic and social policies. Overall, harnessing the demographic dividend will depend on the suitability of the economic environment and policies to translate the potential benefits from the demographic transition into higher growth from both the increase in the number and quality of human capital''a growing labor force that is also better educated and healthier''and physical capital''including the upgrading of public infrastructure and continued private capital formation. Concomitantly, saving rates tend to be higher for working age individuals, hence aggregate saving will also tend to rise, thereby allowing more funding of investment. Saving, investment, and economic activity may receive a boost during the demographic transition, provided that the economic environment does not hamper saving and it is efficiently allocated to productive investments. Finally, increased female labor force participation can also provide additional dividends. The demographic transition comes when both mortality and fertility decrease. But we know that declining fertility rates tend to be associated with higher female labor force participation, And with higher female labor participation, comes higher and more inclusive growth. Hence, removing legal and institutional impediments to female participation is one of the factors that will allow the region to benefit the most from the demographic change. **_What experience says_** Historical experiences are useful to shed some light on key aspects that help exploit the demographic dividend. East Asian countries managed to capture a larger demographic dividend than Latin American thanks to the following factors. * The demographic transition occurred faster in East Asia thanks in part to policies encouraging couples to reduce childbearing and investment in human capital that upgraded the skills and productivity of the growing labor force. * Flexibility of labor markets permitted a better reallocation of workers toward labor intensive manufacturing with higher productivity in East Asia, while financial development allowed channeling increased saving to investment. * Structural transformation was also more intense, with faster increases in average productivity in the economy as a whole, as well as integration in global trade, bringing foreign investment and technology transfers. **_In a nutshell_** Reaping the potential demographic dividend puts an urgent onus on addressing the key constraints to sustained higher growth in the region'particularly gaps in infrastructure (mainly electricity and transport) and skilled human capital (improving health and education systems). In addition, fostering saving and investment''including from abroad''and enhancing competitiveness to boost exports can generate much needed employment for young job-market entrants. Contingent on these policies, we are firmly of the view that the demographic transition will leave sub-Saharan Africa in a much stronger position by boosting savings, investment, and thus raising economic growth.

China, in particular, has grown into a crucial source of demand for Latin American commodities over the past two decades, providing significant gains to the region. The flip side is that the ongoing structural slowdown of Chinese investment [is weighing considerably on the prices of those commodities, and the countries that export them. But Asia can be much more than just a source of episodic windfall gains (and losses) for Latin America. Like a windmill, Asia could help to power a stronger Latin American economy'by providing an example of successful regional trade integration and through greater direct links across the Pacific that benefit both sides. However, securing these benefits will require clear and realistic objectives, a long-term strategy, and attention to the political and social implications of greater economic integration.** ** **Closer economic ties'\u00a6**** ** Economic relations between Latin America and Asia have strengthened significantly over the past 15 years. In particular, gross trade flows between the two regions have grown tenfold since 2000. Stronger trade linkages have also spurred a number of recent initiatives aimed at promoting further integration, including bilateral trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the creation of new multilateral development banks. [ The rise of China has been an important driver behind this development but it does not explain the whole story. Indeed, economic linkages have intensified with other Asian countries, too. For instance, Korea has moved up several places in the rankings of top trading partners for Brazil, Chile, and Peru since 2000. Similarly, India and Japan are important trading partners for a number of countries in Latin America. Financial linkages have also become significant, although there is ample scope for further growth. Japanese foreign direct investment into Latin America has exceeded $110 billion between 2005 and 2014. And Chinese foreign direct investment to the region has increased sharply over the past few years'from a total of $6 billion during 1990'2009 to an average of $10 billion _per year_ between 2010 and 2012 according to data gathered by the [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. **'\u00a6amid large untapped opportunities** And yet there is great potential to deepen the economic relationship between Asia and Latin America. In fact, the surging interregional trade has remained highly uneven. [Despite some progress in growing higher-value added exports, Latin America's shipments are still dominated by raw materials, while its imports from Asia mostly represent a broad set of manufactured goods. Although this phenomenon may partly reflect entrenched comparative advantages, it also suggests that Latin America has not been able to leverage growing trade flows to transform its own economic structures, which remain relatively undiversified. Knowledge spillovers and innovation effects that often accompany trade relations have therefore remained limited. [Undiversified export baskets and limited economic complexity have also constrained the emergence of intraregional supply chains, with the notable exception of Mexico's integration into the North American manufacturing complex. [ Meanwhile, trade patterns within Asia have changed dramatically over the past 20 years. In particular, China has emerged as the linchpin of large cross- border trade (and, more recently, investment) flows, driving technology upgrading, transfer of knowhow, and the emergence of intricate global supply chains. However momentous this process, it has not played out uniformly across all of Asia (as highlighted in [recent work by the Asian Development Bank). Indeed, some sub-regions have remained relatively disconnected from regional trade integration and economic dynamism. [Domestic hurdles, including weak business environments, appear to be an important reason. **Realizing the potential** Similar domestic hurdles may also help to explain why Latin America has failed to develop productive complementarities and deeper intraregional trade relations of the kind observed in Asia. An array of supply-side bottlenecks, including weak education systems, infrastructure gaps, difficult business environments, and various trade barriers have constrained productivity growth, held back investment and innovation, and limited gains from closer relations with other economies. Needless to say, the boom in commodity prices between 2003 and 2011 also contributed to reinforcing a commodity-led growth model. [ To address these challenges and turn trade into a sustainable engine of growth, policymakers in Latin America will need to reduce the existing obstacles to trade (including high transport costs) in the region. But a broader strategic perspective is equally critical: * **Growth reality check**. Against a backdrop of lower commodity prices, tighter external financial conditions, and reduced macroeconomic policy space, achieving robust growth will be more challenging than over the previous decade. Prospects will depend on decisive efforts to address long-standing structural weaknesses that have held back investment and productivity. * **Greater trade integration can support the development of stronger Latin American economies, but objectives have to be realistic. **As a number of empirical studies have documented, trade integration tends to have positive effects on productivity and knowledge transfer. But it is not a magic wand. Efforts to boost intraregional trade as well as stronger links with Asia will need to be underpinned by domestic reform agendas aimed at creating better conditions for entrepreneurial initiative, innovation, and diversification. * **Broad political backing is crucial**. Despite its overall benefits, greater trade integration can have divergent effects on different groups of society. Managing these implications well and ensuring shared gains in prosperity is critical to create and sustain political support for greater openness. In sum, Latin America can turn its relationship with Asia into a lasting source of energy and growth'like a windmill'as opposed to just an episodic source of windfall gains. Today's weak outlook for growth, and the prospect that China's structural investment slowdown will weigh on global commodity markets for the foreseeable future, makes it all the more crucial to start seizing this opportunity. We will explore this theme further in our next Regional Economic Outlook and in a seminar during our [Annual Meetings this October in Lima, Peru.

Business investment is the largest component of private investment, and its weakness has puzzled many of us. Some believe that the key to more business investment is less uncertainty about fiscal policy, regulation, and structural reforms. Some believe that it is providing better financing, including for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). But analysis says these explanations are limited. The facts suggest a much simpler answer: Business investment has been weak because economic activity has been weak. Ensuring a recovery in sales and sales prospects is the key. A [study we published in the April 2015 [_World Economic Outlook_ suggests that virtually all of the weakness in business investment in advanced economies since the crisis can be explained by the weakness in the economic environment (see chart). This is in line with the \"accelerator effect,\" where investment responds to changes in output and sales. (The study isolates the effect of weak growth on weak investment from other influences using a novel statistical approach.) Firms cut investment more severely following the crisis than in previous recessions, but the contraction in overall economic activity was also much more severe. All told the joint behavior of business investment and output has not been that unusual. [ Now, as we leave the crisis behind, with faster growth in advanced economies, longer-term forces related to aging and lower productivity growth continue to cloud the horizon. According to our estimates, long-term growth in advanced economies is now about \u00c2? percentage point [lower than it was before the crisis. What's more, weak banks and high levels of debt'public, corporate, or household'still weigh on spending and growth, to varying degrees. There is a risk that these longer-term forces come together and further reduce incentives to invest. So, even as we see faster growth, policymakers need to remain focused on ensuring a sustained rise in private investment. Here, while policy advice must be country specific, some general principles apply. With monetary policy in advanced economies having largely accomplished what it can, and borrowing costs still low, we need to look elsewhere for ways to boost growth. The case for more [infrastructure investment remains. In countries where the conditions are right (e.g., Germany and the United States), such public investment can further spur demand in the short term, raise supply in the medium term, and, through the accelerator effect, give a boost to private investment today. The message for policymakers is clear: Keep pushing the accelerator.

Unexpected Fed rate hikes have unsettled global markets in the past. The entire global financial system threw a tantrum when then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke merely suggested in May 2013 that the end to bond-buying and other policies could soon begin. However for the past year, the gears of global markets seem to have been thrown into reverse ' it is German government bonds, known as Bunds, rather than U.S. bonds, known as Treasuries, that appear to be driving prices in global bond markets. This role reversal could add a new layer of complexity to investor calculations as they prepare for the beginning of Fed interest rate hikes, which are expected later in 2015. Also, as developments in Greece lead to rises and falls in Bund and Treasury yields, this is a trend worth keeping an eye on. Our latest **[_Global Financial Stability Report_** highlighted that monetary developments in the euro area have had a particularly strong effect on long-term U.S. interest rates. At the Jackson Hole conference of central bankers in August 2014, Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, said he would consider additional unconventional monetary policies to jump start the anemic euro area economy. Shortly after Jackson Hole, the European Central Bank followed through by introducing negative deposit rates and quantitative easing through large-scale asset purchases. This proved a turning point in the relationship between Bunds and Treasuries. Using a statistical approach known as Granger causality analysis, we show that before August 2014, changes in the 10-year Treasury rate were more likely to precede (Granger cause) changes in the 10-year Bund rate. After this date, the reverse was true - changes in Bund yields were more likely to precede (Granger cause) changes in Treasury yields. Sure enough, as 10-year Bund yields declined 50 basis points by the end of 2014, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields declined by a similar amount (Chart 1). [ Further evidence came on May 7, 2015, when 10-year Bund yields jumped from 0.59% to 0.78% (the highest in five months), before ending the daily session essentially unchanged. The Bund change triggered an equivalent response among Treasuries. Investors were quick to compare this to the Treasury 'flash rally'\u009d of October 15, when the market experienced a similar sudden fall then rise. In the first days of June, another spike in 10-year Bund yields from 50 basis points to 1% dragged Treasury yields in their wake from 2.12% to nearly 2.50%. Both German and U.S. long-term interest rates have continued to move together in recent weeks, as developments in Greece lead to rises and falls in Bund and Treasury yields. Our analysis back in October showed that there is some dissonance between market expectations on the timing and pacing of rate hikes and the Fed's own projections. The market expects the pace to be relatively moderate and for the terminal Fed funds rate to be relatively low (Chart 2). This largely remains true even after the 'Bund Bedlam'\u009d helped drive 10-year Treasury rates over 60 bps higher between April and June. As a result, the U.S. Treasury market may be setting itself up for a volatile period when the hard reality of the Fed's intent to raise short-term interest rates inevitably confronts pressure on U.S. long-term rates from Europe. Despite headwinds like a slow first quarter, the stronger dollar and uncertainty arising from Greece, Fed communications have made it clear that the United States continues to make progress towards conditions that justify raising interest rates.

In this context, I thought some reflections on the main critiques could help clarify some key points of contention as well as shine a light on a possible way forward. The main critiques, as I see them, fall under the following four categories: * The 2010 program only served to raise debt and demanded excessive fiscal adjustment. * The financing to Greece was used to repay foreign banks. * Growth-killing structural reforms, together with fiscal austerity, have led to an economic depression. * Creditors have learned nothing and keep repeating the same mistakes. _Critique 1: The 2010 program only served to raise debt and demanded excessive fiscal adjustment_. * Even before the 2010 program, debt in Greece was 300 billion euros, or 130% of GDP. The deficit was 36 billion euros, or 15\u00c2? % of GDP. Debt was increasing at 12% a year, and this was clearly unsustainable. * Had Greece been left on its own, it would have been simply unable to borrow. Given gross financing needs of 20'25 % of GDP, it would have had to cut its budget deficit by that amount. Even if it had fully defaulted on its debt, given a primary deficit of over 10% of GDP, it would have had to cut its budget deficit by 10% of GDP from one day to the next. These would have led to much larger adjustments and a much higher social cost than under the programs, which allowed Greece to take over 5 years to achieve a primary balance. * Even if existing debt had been entirely eliminated, the primary deficit, which was very large at the start of the program, would have had to be reduced. Fiscal austerity was not a choice, but a necessity. There simply wasn't an alternative to cutting spending and raising taxes. The deficit reduction was large because the initial deficit was large. \"Less fiscal austerity,\" i.e., slower fiscal adjustment, would have required even more financing cum debt restructuring, and there was a political limit to what official creditors could ask their own citizens to contribute. _Critique 2: The financing given to Greece was used to repay foreign banks_ * Debt restructuring was delayed by two years. There were reasons for it, namely concerns about contagion risk (Lehman was fresh in memory), and the lack of firewalls to deal with contagion. Whether these reasons were good enough can be argued one way or the other. In real time, the risks were perceived to be too high to proceed with restructuring. * Partly as a result of this delay, an important fraction of the funds in the first program were used to pay short term creditors, and to replace private debt by official debt. The bail-out did not however only benefit foreign banks, but also Greek depositors and households, as one-third of the debt was held by Greek banks and other Greek financial institutions. * Moreover, private creditors were not off the hook, and, in 2012, debt was substantially reduced: The 2012 private sector involvement (PSI) operation led to a haircut of more than 50% on about '\u00ac200 billion of privately held debt, so leading to a decrease in debt of over '\u00ac100 billion (to be concrete, a reduction of debt of 10,000 euros per Greek citizen). * And the shift from private to official creditors came with much better terms, namely below market rates and long maturities. Look at it this way: Cash interest payments on Greek debt last year amounted to 6 billion euros (3.2% of GDP), compared to 12 billion euros in 2009. Or put yet another way, interest payments by Greece were lower, as a proportion of GDP, than interest payments by Portugal, Ireland, or Italy. _Critique 3: Growth-killing structural reforms, together with fiscal austerity, have led to an economic depression_ * Given the dismal productivity growth record of Greece before the program, a number of structural reforms were seen as necessary, ranging from a reform of the tax administration, to reduced barriers to entry in many professions, to reforms of pensions, to reforms of collective bargaining, to reforms of the judicial system, etc. * Many of these reforms were either not implemented, or not implemented on a sufficient scale. Efforts to improve tax collection and the payment culture failed completely. There was fierce resistance to open closed sectors and professions. Only 5 of 12 planned IMF reviews under the current program were completed, and only one has been completed since mid-2013, because of the failure to implement reforms. * The decrease in output was indeed much larger than had been forecast. Multipliers were larger than initially assumed. But fiscal consolidation explains only a fraction of the output decline. Output above potential to start, political crises, inconsistent policies, insufficient reforms, Grexit fears, low business confidence, weak banks, all contributed to the outcome. _Critique 4: Creditors have learned nothing and keep repeating the same mistakes_ * The election of a government in 2015 openly opposed to the program further decreased ownership and required revisiting the existing program, both in terms of policies and in terms of financing. * A more limited set of structural reforms, or/and a slower fiscal adjustment implies, arithmetically, larger financing needs, and, by implication, more need for debt relief. To take an extreme case, if the European creditors were willing to simply forget all existing debt and extend further financing, there would be little need for more adjustment. But, clearly, there were and are political limits to what they can ask their own citizens to contribute. * Thus, a realistic solution had to involve some adjustment, some financing, and some debt relief -- a balanced approach. The role of the IMF in the negotiations was to ask for specific credible adjustments in policies, and make explicit the financing and debt relief implications. * We believed that a small primary surplus, increasing over time, was absolutely necessary to maintain debt sustainability. Having examined the budget closely, we did not see how this could be achieved without VAT reform to broaden the tax base, and pension reform to put the pension system on a sustainable footing. On these, our views coincided fully with those of our European partners. * Until the referendum and its potential implications for growth, we believed that, under these assumptions about the primary surplus, debt sustainability could be achieved through the rescheduling of existing debt, and long maturities for new debt. This was reflected in the preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA) we put out before the referendum. Our assessment was seen as too pessimistic by our European partners to whom we had communicated our views about the need for debt relief long before publishing the debt sustainability analysis. We believe that current developments may well imply the need for even more financing, not least in support of the banks, and for even more debt relief than in our DSA. **A Path Forward**** ** 1. Given the results of the referendum, and the mandate given to the Greek government, we believe that there may still be room for an agreement. It should be based on a set of policies close to those discussed before the referendum, amended to take into account that the government is now requesting a 3-year program, and a more explicit recognition of the need for more financing and more debt relief. 2. Fundamentally, the Euro area faces a political choice: lower reforms and fiscal targets for Greece means a higher cost for the creditor countries. The role of the Fund in this context is not to recommend a particular decision, but to indicate the tradeoff between less fiscal adjustment and fewer structural reforms on the one hand, and the need for more financing and debt relief on the other. 3. The room for agreement is extremely narrow, and time is of the essence. There should be no doubt that exit from the Euro would be extremely costly for Greece and its creditors. The introduction of a new currency, and of redenomination of contracts, raises extremely complex legal and technical issues, and is likely to be associated with a further large decline in output. It may take a long time for the depreciation of the new currency to lead to a substantial turnaround. In sum, we still believe there is a path forward. The Fund is committed to helping Greece through this period of economic turmoil. Given Greece's failure to make a repayment due to the IMF on June 30, the Fund would be unable to provide any financing until the arrears are cleared. However, we have offered to provide technical assistance, where requested, and we remain fully engaged.

But first, let me talk about the elephant in the room, namely Greece. The word elephant may not be right: As dramatic as the events in Greece are, Greece accounts for less than two percent of the Eurozone GDP, and less than one half of one percent of world GDP. Of course, we continue to hope for and work toward a positive solution by which Greece remains in the Eurozone. There is little question that Greece is suffering and may suffer even more under the scenario of a disorderly exit from the Eurozone. But the effects on the rest of the world economy are likely to be limited. Mechanical linkages, through trade or finance, are small. And while one should always worry about contagion, and \"unknown unknowns,'' so far these have not materialized. The world economy has withstood the stress tests of the last two weeks fairly well. There is however a larger lesson to be drawn. The post crisis world is a world with high debt. It does not take much for debt dynamics to get out of control. We are likely to see, and we have to be ready for more episodes of this kind, be it for states, or for financial institutions, or for firms. Leaving Greece aside, general evolutions are unfolding very much as forecast in April. Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging market and developing economies. Forecasts for the world economy are for 3.3 percent this year, and 3.8 percent next year. Going around the world, the main unexpected development was the announcement of a negative growth rate for the first quarter in the [United States. By itself, it can account for more than half of the revision of 0.2 percent to the world economy forecast for 2015. The question, when the numbers came out, was whether this was an indication of underlying weakness of the U.S. economy. Now that the fog has largely cleared, the response is that it was not. Fundamentals are still solid, and the U.S. recovery is on track. Other country developments worth noting: **In advanced economies**, recovery in the [Eurozone is more solidly anchored, including in the much of the periphery. Spain's growth rate for example is now forecast to exceed 3 percent. Despite a strong first quarter, [Japan's growth for 2015 has been revised slightly down, but remains positive, at 0.8 percent. **In emerging economies,** we have left unchanged our forecast for **China**, 6.8 percent for 2015, but with perhaps more uncertainty than before. The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable. In constructing forecasts for China, our assumption continues to be that the Chinese authorities will indeed allow a moderate slowdown of growth, while also using monetary and fiscal policies if needed to prevent too sharp a slowdown. Thus, for 2016 we forecast growth of 6.3 percent, and 6.0 percent in 2017. **Brazil's** growth has been revised down, and is now forecast to be -1.5 percent. Low confidence, together with tighter policies aimed at reestablishing confidence, are combining to yield a recession in the short run. **Russia's** growth is forecast to be -3.4 percent, a bit better than forecast in April, on the back of some improvement in commodity prices and confidence, but still clearly very bad. **Turning to risks**: The nature and distribution of risks is very similar to that in the _[April World Economic Outlook_. Disruptive asset shifts, and lower liquidity in some markets, remain a relevant downside risk. They may materialize when the Fed exits the zero lower bound, but other events could also trigger financial instability for some time. On the good news side, the risk of deflation has decreased: pass-through of lower oil prices is now largely in the past. And, despite low actual inflation, inflation expectations have remained anchored. **Looking beyond these short run forecasts, I see three main macroeconomic issues: ** **First**, how fast advanced economies can eliminate the legacies of the crisis, in particular debt overhang, not only for governments but also for corporations and households. Greece and Puerto Rico are reminders of the dangers of high debt. But, even when debt is sustainable, high debt is a brake to spending and requires low interest rates to sustain demand and output. And these, we have learned, can in turn lead to central banks running again into the zero lower bound, and to excessive risk taking. **Second**, whether advanced economies can significantly increase growth in the medium term. Aging populations and low total factor productivity are combining in many countries to deliver low potential growth. Low growth, especially when combined with high inequality, can easily lead to fiscal, social, and political tensions. The challenge is whether and how structural reforms can improve upon this underlying trend. **Third**, whether the slowdown in growth in a number of emerging market economies reflects temporary or permanent factors. The steady decrease in growth in Latin America over the last five years for example suggests that high growth in the 2000s came in part from increasing commodity prices and loose international financial conditions. The question is then how best to manage the transition to an environment of stable or even declining prices, and tighter financial conditions. To summarize: Moderate growth continues. Measures to increase demand in the short run, and supply in the medium run remain of the essence.

Can officials identify emerging asset price bubbles, what are the implications of bursting them, and is monetary policy the appropriate response to potential bubbles? These questions have become even more important to the policy debate in the wake of the global financial crisis, which was preceded by an unsustainable boom in sub-prime mortgage lending and housing prices. Given over six years of near zero policy interest rates, should the U.S. Fed now use interest rates to lean against potential financial stability risks that may have built up? We argue the answer is 'no.'\u009d Rather, the Fed (and other U.S. officials) should gear their efforts toward strengthening the network of policies, rules and regulations to keep the financial system as a whole safer'known as macroprudential policy. They should also address gaps in regulation and supervision. Our recent [study, provides a framework for thinking about this issue. **In theory, a potential benefit from leaning against financial risks** We find that an _unexpected_ increase of policy interest rates'for example to prick an emerging asset price bubble'does not reduce risks to the financial system. Such a policy reduces output, inflation, and asset prices without fundamentally mitigating financial risks. However, using monetary policy _systematically_ to react to financial risks, such as excessive risk-taking, as they build over time could be worthwhile. Financial market participants respond to the expectation of future monetary policy actions by taking fewer risks in the first place. As a result, a simple policy rule that responds to higher financial sector 'leverage'\u009d,' using borrowed funds to finance investments'could improve economic outcomes (see figure). Sacrificing a modest amount of growth today would reduce the risk of economically costly financial crises in the future. **In practice, still a ways to go** As is often the case, the theoretical findings turn out to be easier said than done in practice. * **_First_**, for the policy to work, financial sector leverage needs to be pro-cyclical. However, here the evidence is mixed. Leverage tends to move with the economic cycle during some periods and for some types of intermediation. But this is not always and everywhere true. Another [paper by our colleagues, for example, finds that the nature of credit cycles varies a lot depending on whether we are talking about commercial banks, investment banks, insurance, asset management or other sources of financial intermediation. * **_Second_**, for the policy to be effective, it requires a clear diagnostic as to why leverage is increasing that is available with sufficient foresight to head problems off early, before they impact the financial system as a whole. Misreading the reason for the increase in leverage can lead to costly policy mistakes. * _**Third**,_ targeted macroprudential policy appears to generate better results (see figure), largely because, unlike policy interest rates, it is unburdened with trying to also achieve inflation and output objectives at the same time. * **_Finally_**, a systematic leaning-against-the-wind policy requires a credible policy framework. The central bank needs to clearly communicate its objectives, making clear it is willing and able to react to what it views as financial excesses. To sum up, the Fed should deploy supervisory and regulatory tools to build financial resilience and manage risks to the financial system. Our framework suggests that while there are, in theory, potential benefits from monetary policy leaning against the wind, more work is needed to make this a viable option in practice. Therefore, priority should be giving to accelerating research on the theoretical and empirical nexus between interest rate changes and financial vulnerabilities, working to identify appropriate measures of the financial cycle, and expanding our understanding on how and when monetary policy might best be used to tackle financial stability risks.

The Fed has argued it is likely to start in the second half of this year, but that this will be dependent on the state of the U.S. economy. Indeed, Fed Chair Janet Yellen used the word 'gradual'\u009d several times in her latest press conference and this message was further underlined by the unhurried pace of policy rate increases forecast by Federal Open Market Committee members. Preliminary findings of the ongoing [IMF health check of the U.S. economy suggest that, despite a weak first quarter, growth in the coming months is likely to pick up, accompanied by steady gains in job creation. In this context, a data-dependent approach clearly calls for a gradual pace of monetary policy normalization. The IMF mission also argued that taking the first step along that gradual path should happen once there are more tangible signs of wage or price inflation than are currently evident. **Balancing multiple risks ** The key task of monetary policy today is to weigh the balance of multiple risks. Our paper lays out a framework for thinking about U.S. monetary policy in the face of two-sided but uncertain risks. The paper finds that'under conditions of still recovering demand, low inflation, and the policy interest rate near zero'the balance of risks favors more patience to start interest rate increases. The consequence of such a policy would still mean gradual, albeit slightly steeper, path of subsequent rate increases and a modest planned overshooting of inflation. The intuition is straightforward: it is costly to have the policy interest rate at zero, where the room for maneuver to respond to negative shocks becomes constrained. This is the '[dark corner'\u009d in the title. Given the potential for future negative shocks that could push the economy back toward low growth and falling inflation, optimal policy should aim to get the economy as quickly as possible back to full employment and away from this dark corner. Waiting a little longer to pull the trigger on policy rates'as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says, until the 'whites of inflation's eyes are visible'\u009d'provides valuable insurance against ending back at zero interest rates. The case is further strengthened when one takes into account uncertainties related to the amount of slack and the [neutral policy rate. Such a policy has the potential to temporarily generate a bit more inflation (see chart). But that's okay and, we think, a reasonable cost to pay. After all, expectations are well anchored and the Fed has strong credibility and a proven track record in addressing inflation, when it arises. [ **Effective communications can be a powerful monetary policy tool** We also argue that there are steps to further strengthen the effectiveness of the Fed's communication strategy that could help avoid the dark corners. As Chair Yellen said in a 2013 [speech, the effects of monetary policy depend critically on the public getting the message about what the Fed is expected to do in setting the policy interest rate months or years in the future. Flexible inflation targeting, as now practiced by a number of central banks, provides a useful template for this purpose. While the specific structure of these regimes has differed across countries, the adoption of numerical inflation objectives has strengthened the emphasis on the communication practices of central banks. There is room to further improve the Fed's communications framework. To better guide expectations and provide clarity to markets about the Fed's inflation and output objectives and intentions, the Fed could start publishing a regular monetary policy report that contains forecasts for key economic indicators'inflation, output, and interest rates'as well as alternative scenarios to illustrate how it sees the uncertainties around that outlook. A report with consistent macroeconomic forecasts could be a tremendously valuable communication tool. For example, in the current situation, it could provide a clearer picture of the 'gradual'\u009d path Chair Yellen has emphasized in her policy communications, focusing attention on the whole road ahead while diluting attention on the specific date of the initial policy interest rate increase. After all, it is the full path of rate increases that really matters for the economic outlook. There are certainly logistical challenges in implementing such an approach, not least in forging an agreement on a path for policy rates within a large and diverse Federal Open Market Committee. However, these should be outweighed by the exceptional value of a fully articulated and internally consistent forecast, published in a regular monetary policy report and endorsed by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee.

Such communication is important to help identify and measure _systemic risks_ as well as to coordinate and/or conduct _macroprudential policies_'rules that reduce instability across the financial system. The creation of financial stability committees, including in Latin America, have been a forum for precisely this'working together to share information about evolving risks, develop monitoring and mitigating tools, and to define the decision-making authority, accountability, and communication to the general public. But institutional design and governance of these councils differ across countries. A recent conference in Lima, Peru'organized by the IMF and the Central Reserve Bank of Peru'brought together experts from advanced countries and Latin American regulators that have established financial stability committees to share experiences and discuss early lessons about the functions and governance of these committees. **Different structures** Financial stability committees involve all major stakeholders'including central banks, ministries of finance and financial supervisors'but governance structures differ across countries. These differences relate to existing (pre- crisis) arrangements, different trade-offs with other policies (monetary, microprudential), as well as legal and institutional constraints. Central banks play a central role in the coordination of stability mandates, owing to their expertise, credibility, and independence, but in many countries it is the ministry of finance that has the lead'due to their role in the budget and legislative processes. The debate on the best governance structure has not yet been settled in the profession. In two countries in Latin America'Chile and Mexico'the Ministry of Finance chairs the financial stability committee, but the central bank has an important role as an advisor or in leading the analytical work. Brazil, in contrast, has followed a model closer to the United Kingdom, where a dedicated committee within the central bank coordinates the activities of all supervisory agencies. Besides sharing data and conducting analytical studies, these committees could have higher powers, such as asking other agencies to 'comply or explain'\u009d why the committees' recommendations were not followed, thus increasing transparency and accountability. **Monetary and Macro-prudential Policies** Another issue that was debated in the conference was the interaction between monetary and macroprudential policies. In principle, many participants supported a separation of both policies, except when a well-articulated cost- benefit analysis shows the advantages of 'leaning against the wind'\u009d of financial (in)stability for the monetary authority. For example, an early tightening of monetary policy to contain increases in household debt may thwart an economic recovery'with the costs of increased unemployment outweighing the marginal benefits of reduced debt. However, to articulate and/or estimate these costs and benefits is quite challenging, and may lead to inaction or aggressive action (as seen in Sweden in the recent past). Developing the analytical skills for this type of analysis is central to the effectiveness of these committees. More broadly, since both policies affect financial conditions, and these analytical skills may be in short supply in emerging markets, a stronger coordination between both macroprudential and monetary policies may be warranted for some countries. **Main takeaways** Three key issues emerged from the discussions and presentations of Latin America's experience: * **First**, there are concerns about the _legal uncertainty_ of actions undertaken by the financial stability committees for the heads of agencies bound by their own legal frameworks. Clear objectives, mandates, and powers for members of these committees are thus critical to prevent this legal uncertainty. * **Second**, most financial stability committees focus on macroprudential policies and have an unclear role in _crisis resolution_ or when financial stability is threatened, whereas public perceptions may relate more to the committees' role in crisis than in normal times. * **Third**, from an emerging market perspective, issues like the impact of capital flows volatility, foreign exchange and asset price dynamics on balance sheets and financial stability require a central role for central banks'even if the lead in the committee is with the ministry of finance. Regardless of the institutional design, it is critical to build an interface between macroeconomists and financial sector experts. More discussion and debate on these issues can contribute to building the right institutions for financial stability.

It is becoming increasingly clear that these developments have profound economic implications. [ [Earlier IMF work has shown that income inequality is bad for growth and its sustainability. Our [new research shows that income distribution itself'not just the level of income inequality'matters for growth. Specifically, we find that making the rich richer by one percentage point _lowers_ GDP growth in a country over the next five years by 0.08 percentage points'whereas making the poor and the middle class one percentage point richer can _raise _GDP growth by as much as 0.38 percentage points (Chart 2). Put simply, boosting the incomes of the poor and the middle class can help raise growth prospects for all. [ One possible explanation is that the poor and the middle class tend to consume a higher fraction of their income than the rich. If more money flows to these segments of society, they will consume rather than save, raising demand and spurring aggregate growth in the short run. What this means is that the poor and the middle class are key engines of growth. But with inequality on the rise, those engines are stalling. Over the longer run, persistent inequality means that the the poor and the middle class have fewer opportunities to get educated, enhance their skills, and pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. As a result, labor productivity and growth suffer. **Factors at play** Inequality has been falling in some bright spots in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa. But even in these regions, there is little room for comfort, given the pervasive inequalities of opportunity and access to education, health care, and finance. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world, for example, around half of the poorest segments of the population have less than four years of education (Chart 3). In developing countries more generally, access to healthcare and finance is scarce for the poor.** ** [ In addition to looking at the consequences of inequality, our study also examines some of the causes. Our results suggest that there are many common factors behind rising income inequality, irrespective of a country's level of economic development. One such factor is technological change, which can raise the demand for skilled labor over low-skilled labor by eliminating jobs through automation or upgrading the skill level required to keep those jobs. The decline of some labor market institutions (such as lower trade union power) is another. These factors help overall growth and productivity, but they also tend to boost inequality, at least in the absence of compensating measures. Globalization has also played a role in reinforcing inequality, albeit a smaller one. We find that the rising skill premium'that is, the wage difference between skilled and unskilled workers'is associated with widening income disparity in advanced countries. Financial deepening'or the expansion of bank credit and financial markets'is associated with rising inequality in emerging market and developing economies. This is particularly true in the early stages of financial deepening, as access to financial services is limited to a small segment of population, although the benefits become more broadly shared as economies develop.

At the core of the negotiations is a simple question: How much of an adjustment has to be made by Greece, how much has to be made by its official creditors? In the program agreed in 2012 by Greece with its European partners, the answer was: Greece was to generate enough of a primary surplus to limit its indebtedness. It also agreed to a number of reforms which should lead to higher growth. In consideration, and subject to Greek implementation of the program, European creditors were to provide the needed financing, and provide debt relief if debt exceeded 120% by the end of the decade. The primary surplus in the program was to be 3% in 2015, and 4.5% next year. Economic and political developments have made this an unattainable goal, and the target clearly must be decreased. It also included a number of reforms aimed at increasing medium term growth, and making the fiscal adjustment easier. These also need to be reconsidered. In this context, by how much should the primary surplus target be reduced? A lower target leads to a less painful fiscal and economic adjustment for Greece. But it also leads to a need for more external official financing, and a commitment to more debt relief on the part of the European creditor countries. Just as there is a limit to what Greece can do, there is a limit to how much financing and debt relief official creditors are willing and realistically able to provide given that they have their own taxpayers to consider. How should the initial set of reforms be reassessed? Greek citizens, through a democratic process, have indicated that there were some reforms they do not want. We believe that these reforms are needed, and that, absent these reforms, Greece will not be able to sustain steady growth, and the burden of debt will become even higher. Here again, there is a trade off: To the extent that the pace of reform is slower, creditors will have to provide more debt relief. Here again, there is a clear limit to what they are willing to do. The offer made to the Greek government last week reflected these considerations and these tradeoffs. It proposed to lower the medium term primary budget surplus target from 4.5% of GDP to 3.5%, and give Greece two more years to achieve that target--so the target for this year was reduced to 1%--and it asked for a more limited set of reforms. For a deal along these lines to be effective and credible however, two conditions must be satisfied. On the one hand, the Greek government has to offer truly credible measures to reach the lower target budget surplus, and it has to show its commitment to the more limited set of reforms. We believe that even the lower new target cannot be credibly achieved without a comprehensive reform of the value-added tax (VAT) ' involving a widening of its base ' and a further adjustment of pensions. Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners. We are open to alternative ways for designing both the VAT and the pension reforms, but these alternatives have to add up and deliver the required fiscal adjustment. On the other hand, the European creditors would have to agree to significant additional financing, and to debt relief sufficient to maintain debt sustainability.We believe that, under the existing proposal, debt relief can be achieved through a long rescheduling of debt payments at low interest rates. Any further decrease in the primary surplus target, now or later, would probably require, however, haircuts. These are tough choices, and tough commitments to be made on both sides. We hope that agreement can be achieved along these lines.

Designed to replace the [Millennium Development Goals, these new goals will broaden the vision of development to embrace economic, social, and environmental issues. To achieve these goals, two elements are critical: money and the right policies to use the money. The IMF, along with many others in the global community, will partner with countries to bring these two elements together. **New goals, new world** Countries are pursuing development goals in a new environment, as the world has become increasingly interconnected since the early 2000s. Global trade flows have increased steadily in the past two decades (Chart 1).[ Many [frontier economies are rapidly integrating with global financial markets. In 2014, for instance, C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Vietnam and Zambia issued government bonds totaling about US$7 billion. At the same time official development assistance has lost its top rank as the main source of capital flows to developing countries, dropping from 1.6 percent of developing countries' collective GDP in 1990 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2012 (Chart 2). [ This increased integration has made developing countries more exposed to economic highs and lows from outside their borders' economists call them shocks' such as swings in global commodity prices, capital flows, and changes in exchange rates, to name a few. **Mobilize domestic revenues ** To fund development needs and to build resilience against shocks, many developing countries need both higher revenues and better managed tax collection and administration. Our engagement with countries shows that domestic policies can yield results (Chart 3). [ For example, Peru has increased its [domestic tax ratio from 6 to 13 percent of GDP over the 1990s, and stabilized it at about 17 percent since 2010; many others'for example, Tanzania and Vietnam'have made important strides as well. Also, there is tremendous scope for strengthening domestic resources while addressing environmental concerns through [energy price reform and carbon pricing, for example. The IMF is helping countries strengthen their capacity to raise money at the national level and reform energy taxation and subsidies, among others. Major advanced and emerging market economies can also help through collective action. These include: fulfilling foreign aid commitments to support the most vulnerable, enhancing international tax cooperation, reviving the global trade liberalization agenda, and agreeing national targets for reducing CO2 emissions at the climate change summit in Paris in December 2015. **Resilient economies is the goal** Money alone isn't enough' countries need policies to translate and implement the sustainable development goals for their particular circumstances. They will need the right mix of policies to maintain an attractive environment for investment to thrive and make effective use of available resources on priority areas, such as health and education. In particular, good policies can help countries recover and rebound even through the worst shocks from outside their borders. This covers measures that raise the contribution from their own resources to fund their goals. And measures to ensure that countries put to good use their funds, whether borrowed or from taxes, to address infrastructure gaps and promote inclusion. This will help create growth that is strong, sustained, and broadly shared, with debt levels that remain sustainable. These are all important components of a successful development strategy'and at the core of the IMF's work with countries. Countries are in the driver's seat when it comes to their development goals. Their more advanced economy partners also need to do their part, adopting measures to foster stable global economic and financial conditions. And international institutions are akin to developing countries' pit crews: a coterie of technical experts and advisors who work together with the driver to keep the show on the road. The IMF is working with developing countries to strengthen their economies' resilience in a more connected world. We are exploring options to refine our financing facilities to boost access to IMF concessional resources for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. And we are exploring ways to provide stronger safety nets for countries that have access to foreign capital markets, which also exposes them to capital flow shocks. These reforms will aim to enable developing countries to be better prepared to handle economic shocks while they pursue their development. As we embark on the road towards [Addis Ababa and beyond, all of us in the international community must step up our engagement to help ensure the Sustainable Development Goals become a reality.

Broader access to housing finance promotes home ownership, especially for younger and poorer households; which in turn is often linked to social stability, and ultimately economic growth. But real-estate boom episodes have often ended in busts with dire economic consequences, especially when the boom was financed through fast credit growth. Several countries have seen these boom-bust patterns over the last decade, particularly in some of the hardest hit countries during the global financial crises, such as Ireland, Spain, and the United States. Despite having different mortgage market structures, these three countries saw an astonishing increase in house prices and construction on the back of risky lending which was followed by a painful adjustment period'a mortgage credit boom gone bad. Where are we now in this debate between broadening access to housing finance and containing the dangers associated with fast growing mortgage credit? Here, we think policy needs to be informed by a better understanding of the role housing finance plays both in funding households (and ultimately economic growth) and in generating financial vulnerability. For example, how and why does housing finance differ across countries? What are the effects of these differences for economic growth? How does housing finance affect housing booms and their association with the probability and severity of financial crises? In a recent [staff discussion note we examine some of these issues. This is made possible by a new dataset on housing finance characteristics, house prices, and household credit for a sample of more than 50 countries. This new detailed cross-country analysis confirms some of the findings of previous [work, but also offers new insights. We draw the following broad conclusions. **First, the size of the mortgage market relative to GDP varies significantly across countries **(Chart 1)**.** Deeper mortgage markets are associated with better institutional quality and low inflation environments. They are also accompanied by higher home ownership rates, which, in turn, are linked to higher school attainment, higher social capital, and lower crime. [ **Second, some of the housing finance characteristics associated with deeper mortgage markets are also linked with increased risks of crisis.** The characteristics of the mortgage market vary across countries (Chart 2). These characteristics are worth examining since they affect the buildup of risks during a boom. For example, higher loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), allow less wealthy individual to enter the housing market, but are also associated with excessively rapid house-price and credit growth during booms. Banking systems that rely more heavily on wholesale funding (rather than customer deposits) tend to provide a greater supply of mortgages, but they also perform worse in the aftermath of housing booms. [ **Third, to achieve deeper mortgage markets as a way to increase access to home ownership, countries should focus first on improving institutions (e.g., legal rights) and the economic environment (e.g. stabilize inflation).** This is perhaps a safer way to promote mortgage markets compared to measures that may unintentionally lead to looser credit standards and incentives for excessive leverage. **Fourth, in the event of a housing boom, macroprudential tools (in particular ceilings on loan-to-value-ratios) should be the first line of defense against the build-up of excessive vulnerabilities.** These instruments have an advantage over monetary policy due to their narrow focus. They are able to address potential excesses in one sector of the economy without having a large impact on others.** ** **Don't downplay the role of monetary policy** That said, the role of monetary policy in addressing house-related credit booms should not always be downplayed. Despite the absence of important inflation pressures, about 60 percent of the identified past real-estate booms occurred as a result of, or at the same time as, rapid economic growth and broad high credit growth in the economy. Monetary policy would be a necessary complement of macroprudential measures in those cases. Further, should macroprudential tools prove ineffective, monetary authorities should weigh the benefits and costs of 'leaning against the wind'\u009d (a tighter stance than what is needed to maintain price stability) to contain imbalances that could lead to worse outcomes over the medium run. Finally, dealing effectively with real-estate booms requires a broad mix of policies. Macroprudential and monetary policies are key ingredients, but fiscal incentives and house supply considerations are structural country- specific elements that may bear heavily on the probability of booms occurring and the potential costs of a bust.

Part of this weakness appears to be here to stay, and IMF economists have marked down medium-term growth projections. This story sounds eerily familiar, given the region's past difficulties to improve its comparative growth performance. Abstracting from the 'golden decade'\u009d from 2003 to 2011, when rising commodity prices powered a strong expansion, why has the region been unable to sustain sufficiently high growth rates to catch up with more advanced economies? Part of the answer is Latin America's modest success in branching out into more sophisticated'or complex'goods. [ **A complex factor** Recent [research led by Ricardo Hausmann and Cesar Hidalgo has put forward the concept of economic complexity as a key determinant of long-term growth and development. Economic complexity is meant to capture the productive knowledge of a country, as inferred from the breadth and sophistication of goods that a country exports. More complex economies tend to export a wider range of goods, and these goods tend to be more sophisticated. Given Latin America's considerable reliance on commodity exports, it is tempting to think that lack of diversification and complexity is a major roadblock to stronger growth. What does the empirical evidence say about this argument? Is the region actually less complex than others? How big a handicap is this? And what can be done about it? We analyze these questions in our latest [regional outlook. Consistent with Hausmann's main hypothesis, more complex economies on average have higher levels of income per capita. Data also show that Latin America and the Caribbean are far less complex than advanced economies or the newly industrialized Asian economies, which arguably represent the most successful examples of economic catch-up and development over the past four decades. In addition, complexity has been stagnant or trending down in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1970, although the region looks no worse than the broader group of emerging economies. [ [ **Predicting growth** Do these complexity statistics simply reflect current levels of prosperity, or can they tell us anything about future growth trends as well? [Research by Hausmann and coauthors suggests that complexity indeed helps to predict long-run growth of GDP per capita. We have revisited this issue, considering several econometric extensions and using a large panel of more than 100 countries between 1970 and 2010. Our results confirm the importance of complexity as a predictor of long- run growth, alongside other relevant variables, such as demographics, commodity exports, and indicators of macroeconomic stability. We then applied these results to gauge the quantitative implications for different countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The variation in complexity levels observed across the region can account for differences of almost a full percentage point in annual per capita growth. In other words, if we abstract from other determinants of growth, the most complex economies in the region (like Mexico and Brazil) would outpace the less complex ones by a full percentage point every year. However, the growth dividends from complexity can be offset by other variables. For instance, each year of macroeconomic instability can reduce GDP per capita growth by a cumulative 2 percentage points over the course of a decade. Higher dependency ratios can also meaningfully reduce growth, which draws attention to the demographic trends in the region over the coming decades. **Policy takeaways** What are the policy implications for Latin America and the Caribbean from our findings and the related literature? * Complexity matters for long-term growth, but increasing it alone is not sufficient. In particular, policymakers will also need to maintain their focus on preserving macroeconomic stability. * Swift progress on structural reforms should remain a priority. Latin America and the Caribbean continue to lag behind in several policy areas closely associated with economic complexity (infrastructure, education, and market openness). Faster progress in these areas represents the most natural way to support higher complexity and growth. * Meanwhile, a renewed push for activist development policies needs to be handled with caution. While the discussion of new strategic approaches in this area is welcome, a more systematic understanding about the costs and risks associated with such policies is necessary before scaling them up. Indeed, earlier experiences with industrial policies send a cautionary note, especially for countries in which governance and institutional quality are still lagging behind. * Even so, complexity research can help countries to better understand their comparative advantages and assess the potential for knowledge upgrading. Insights gained from cross-country data could be used, for instance, to inform trade and investment negotiations in ways that best leverage a country's knowledge base. In sum, complexity appears to be an important determinant of long-run economic growth as well as a useful lens through which to analyze the development of countries' productive capacity.

So much better off than two decades ago, and still facing deep-seated problems that get in the way of sustained strong growth and economic development. To better understand these problems from countries' perspectives, and explore ways the IMF and others can help address them, we brought together experts from the region and beyond'central bankers, finance ministers, and academics'for a [high-level conference in Washington, D.C. earlier this week. Under the theme of '[Rising Challenges to Growth and Stability,'\u009d participants engaged in lively debates about the current difficulties facing Latin America and the policy priorities for now and the future. Here are my main takeaways from the event: **1\\. Savor the progress**. Everyone recognized that Latin America has come a long way since the days of hyperinflation and debt crises of the 1980s and 90s. Countries have strengthened their economic policy frameworks, and exchange rate flexibility now provides an important buffer for external shocks in many countries. Simultaneously, poverty rates have fallen, inequality has come down, and the middle class has grown. These economic and social advances have been underpinned by the broad-based establishment of democratic societies. [ Mario Blejer, Guillermo Ortiz, Alejandro Werner, Arminio Fraga, and Charles Collyns \\(IMF photo\\). The first session featured (l-r) Mario Blejer, Guillermo Ortiz, Alejandro Werner, Arminio Fraga, and Charles Collyns (IMF photo). **2\\. Life after the bonanza**. The optimism of 2010, when the region made an impressive rebound from the global financial crisis and grew more than 6 percent, has faded. Economic activity has been slowing every year since then, and most panelists agreed that medium-term growth is also likely to be mediocre, as the 'good luck'\u009d of booming commodity markets is over and structural weaknesses'in the form of low saving, low investment, and low productivity'have come to the fore. In the words of Mario Blejer, there can be no doubt that 'the party is over.'\u009d **3\\. Risks**. There was a broader range of views on how much the region will be affected by rising U.S. interest rates, which could potentially lead to capital outflows, higher funding costs, and weaker domestic currencies. One view was that balance sheets are quite resilient, as a lot of government debt is now denominated in domestic currency, foreign exchange reserves are ample, and firms have learnt the lesson from past crises and only take on foreign-currency debt for which they have appropriate hedges. But others still saw important vulnerabilities now that firms across Latin America are facing a combination of increased indebtedness, lower growth, and weaker commodity prices. Adding the potential risk of further commodity price declines, perhaps in the context of weaker-than-expected growth in China, the period ahead could still be, in the words of one participant, 'a rough ride.'\u009d I certainly agree that vigilance will be key. **4\\. Policies matter**. Although the general outlook is relatively dim, there are important differences across the region. Many speakers emphasized the relatively more favorable prospects for countries with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals, which are better prepared to handle challenging times. In other countries, speakers argued that misguided policies (or 'self-inflicted wounds'\u009d) played an important role in creating today's difficult mix of low growth and elevated inflation. Carmen Reinhart put it well when she said that preventing macroeconomic crisis'with the large output losses that past crises have typically entailed'is crucial for raising living standards across Latin America on a sustained basis. **5\\. Macro vs. micro**. Ensuring good economic policies alone clearly isn't sufficient. As our second panel discussed in depth, growth in Latin America lags behind other emerging market regions, despite important gains in macroeconomic stability. To put it simply, macroeconomic conditions have improved in many countries (notwithstanding a few important exceptions), but microeconomic problems remain a major obstacle to productivity and growth across the region. One reflection of these problems is the persistence of very high informality in many economies. [. IMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton delivered opening remarks (IMF photo). **6\\. Reform priorities**. Once the focus shifts from macro to micro, the discussion naturally becomes quite rich and diverse, and so we heard a range of ideas on what are the 'most binding constraints'\u009d on growth. Nonetheless, there was a general sense that labor markets, education, infrastructure, and governance quality are key problem areas. In a nutshell, to generate a sustained rise in investment and economic dynamism, Latin America will need to upgrade its physical and human capital as well as the institutions supporting the market economy. **7\\. Economic diversification and trade**. Many panelists also argued that progress would have to involve greater diversification of economic structures along with deeper integration through trade'both within the region and with respect to other dynamic parts of the global economy, such as Asia's famed value chains. In this context, several speakers saw a case for smart industry-level intervention. Personally, I agree with the objective to put Latin America's economies on a broader basis. But I remain cautious about attempts to fine-tune economic development. As we noted in our recent _[Regional Economic Outlook_, there are still a lot of basic things to get right (in education, infrastructure, and governance) before turning to more activist sectoral policies that are fraught with risks. **8\\. Political buy-in**. Securing popular support for reforms remains a key political challenge. In this context, several panelists stressed the region's legacy of high inequality, which tends to hamper the emergence of a broad consensus on desirable policies. An extended period of low growth could compound this challenge, given high expectations for further social and economic progress. However, there is also significant scope to achieve better outcomes without additional resources. As one of the panels discussed, current government policies in many Latin American countries'even those with high taxes and extensive transfer schemes'fail to effectively improve the distribution of income. Clearly, more targeted, better-designed policies are needed to secure shared prosperity. **9\\. Turning challenge into opportunity**. Any difficult situation is also an opportunity for making decisive improvements that countries could not achieve during normal times. The ongoing corruption scandals in several countries may be a good example'if they are now used to bring about lasting improvements in governance and the rule of law. As Arminio Fraga said, this could be a 'watershed moment.'\u009d I believe this is true more broadly: Latin America today is facing very significant challenges; the task ahead is to rise to those challenges and turn them into an opportunity. I look forward to deepening our discussion on these important issues over the months ahead, as we continue our close engagement with the region on the '[Road to Lima.'\u009d ", "index": 211}, {"pub": "6/4/2015", "title": "U.S. Economy Returning to Growth, but With Pockets of Vulnerability", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=9779", "content": " [By [Christine Lagarde IMF staff have just concluded their annual health check of the U.S. economy, and released their [concluding statement. This year we have also undertaken a Financial Sector Assessment Program with the United States. We conduct these once every 5 years for systemically important countries and it is a comprehensive exercise looking at the whole U.S. financial system. Given this important work, we have focused our review of the U.S. economy on financial stability risks and the appropriate policies to mitigate them, as well as looking at recent movements in the U.S. dollar and the timing, form, and impact of interest rate normalization by the Fed. A more detailed report on the U.S. economy and on the financial sector will be available on July 8. **Economic outlook** Yet again, the review took place against the background of a shaky first quarter for the U.S. economy. And we revised our growth forecast down to 2.5 percent for 2015. This is largely due to those factors that affected the first quarter. But this is not our main message. Our main point is that we still believe that the underpinnings for a continued expansion are in place. The labor market has steadily improved over the last year'job growth has averaged about 250,000 per month' and financial conditions remain very accommodative. Moreover, we expect cheaper oil prices to boost consumption in the remainder of 2015, although lower oil prices is going to continue taking a bite out of oil-related investment, as we saw in the first quarter. As always, there are **risks and uncertainties to the outlook**. For example, further delay of the housing recovery and the strong dollar'notwithstanding the latest improvement in the trade balance'could be a drag on future growth. Nevertheless, when we look at the whole picture, we believe that growth in the coming quarters will be 3 percent or higher. We see **inflation pressures** as muted. Long-term unemployment and high levels of part-time work both point to remaining employment slack. Wage indicators on the whole have shown only tepid growth. When combined with dollar appreciation and cheaper energy costs, we expect inflation to start rising later in the year, but only slowly, reaching the Federal Reserve's 2 percent medium-term objective by mid 2017. Over the medium term, as we highlighted last year, there is still much work to be done. Our forecasts of potential growth are now around 2 percent'a far cry from the over 3 percent average growth rates we saw before the Great Recession. This leads to our policy recommendations in three key areas. 1. ** Monetary policy** On monetary policy, as we have noted before, the Fed's first rate increase in almost 9 years is being carefully prepared and telegraphed. Nevertheless, regardless of the timing, higher U.S. policy rates could still result in significant market volatility with financial stability consequences that go well beyond U.S. borders. In weighing these risks, we think there is a case for waiting to raise rates until there are more tangible signs of wage or price inflation than are currently evident. Even after the first rate increase, a gradual rise in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate. Such a path may create a modest and temporary rise of inflation above the Fed's medium-term goal' perhaps up toward 2\u00c2? percent. However, pursuing a cautious and gradual approach to interest rate normalization would provide valuable insurance against the risk of disinflation and needing to cut rates back to zero. In the coming months, continued clear and effective communication by the Fed will be more important than ever. Last year we made some recommendations on the communications toolkit'such as scheduling press conferences after each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and publishing a quarterly monetary report. We recognize the difficulties with adding more communication, but we continue to believe it merits consideration. 2. ** Financial stability** Our team has taken a detailed and comprehensive look at the health of the financial sector under our Financial Stability Assessment Program. Much has been done over the past several years to strengthen the U.S. financial system. It will be important to ensure that this progress'including the legislative advances in the Dodd Frank Act'is not rolled back. Diluting the important progress made would clearly be undesirable. It also seems clear that risks have built up during the long period of exceptionally low interest rates. Nevertheless, today, the data point toward a system with pockets of vulnerabilities rather than one with broad-based excesses. But we shouldn't minimize these risks. These pockets could create serious, macro-relevant sources of financial instability both here and abroad. Some of our concerns include the migration of intermediation to so-called 'shadow banks'\u009d and the potential for insufficient liquidity in a range of fixed income markets, particularly as these markets come under stress. I know that the U.S. authorities are investing heavily in understanding and assessing these issues. Some key policy recommendations to reduce financial stability risks include: * Giving all the individual Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) members an explicit financial stability mandate so as to further strengthen the effectiveness of the FSOC. * Undertaking a concerted effort to provide the FSOC and the Office of Financial Research with the data they need to build a comprehensive view and analysis of systemic risks. * Updating the regulatory regime in the insurance sector to create an independent and well-resourced body that has a nationwide remit. There are further details, of course, in the concluding statement. 3. ** Fiscal Policies** As we have said before, given our forecast of a steady rise in the public- debt-to-GDP ratio, it remains critically important to adopt and implement a credible medium-term fiscal plan. This requires actions on tax reform, social security reform, and steps to contain healthcare costs. Tackling these fiscal challenges will provide scope to expand the near-term budget envelope for measures to support future growth, job creation, and productivity. Here, I would prioritize infrastructure spending, better education spending, and policies that raise labor force participation including steps like subsidized childcare assistance. In conclusion: * We believe near-term U.S. growth prospects are good. * It is better to wait for stronger signs of inflation pressures and have an interest rate hike in the first half of 2016. * Even after the initial step to raise rates, a gradual rise in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate. * And although important progress has been made to strengthen the U.S. financial system, there is more to be done to address the pockets of vulnerability.

Ghosh Financial bailouts, stimulus spending, and lower revenues during the Great Recession have resulted in some of the highest public debt ratios seen in advanced economies in the past forty years. Recent debates have centered on the _pace_ at which to pay down this debt, with few questions being asked about _whether_ the debt needs to be paid down in the first place. A radical solution for high debt is to do _nothing at all_'just live with it. Indeed, from a welfare economics perspective'abstracting from real world problems such as rollover risk'this would be optimal. We explore this issue in [our recent work. While there are some countries where clearly debt needs to be brought down, there are others that are in a more comfortable position to fund themselves at exceptionally low interest rates, and that could indeed simply live with their debt (allowing their debt ratio to decline through growth or windfall revenues). **The case for living with debt** A simple way to understand the basic intuition for just living with debt is to recall Robert Barro's 'tax-smoothing'\u009d principle (whereby constant tax rates are efficient because distortionary costs are typically convex'rising at a faster rate'in the tax rate). The economic burden of public debt is the distortionary cost associated with the taxes needed to service it, potentially in perpetuity. But that is a sunk cost, already incurred, and' short of default'now unavoidable. It provides no reason to further distort the economy by temporarily raising taxes only to lower them again once the debt has been paid down. **Three objections may be raised to this argument**: (i) in some countries, debt is dangerously high and there is risk of a funding crisis; (ii) debt is bad for growth and should therefore be paid down; (iii) there may be large fiscal shocks in the future, so it is sensible to build up buffers against them. Each of these is a potentially serious objection and merits careful consideration. **Avoiding funding crises** It is clear that in some cases, debt indeed needs to be paid down. Some countries have little fiscal space (they are close to a debt limit at which markets may demand a huge risk premium or even deny them access) and debt sustainability constraints in such situations will leave them little choice but to deliberately run budgetary surpluses. But what is necessary for some countries is not what is appropriate for all. Policy advice always needs to be tailored to country circumstances'there should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to debt repayment issues any more than in other spheres of economic policy making. It may be helpful to think of countries' debt levels falling into three zones: a green zone where fiscal space is ample; a yellow zone where space is positive but sovereign risks are salient; and a red zone where fiscal space has run out. In the red zone, and possibly the yellow zone, debt sustainability constraints leave few options, and countries indeed need to focus on bringing the debt down. This certainly applies to countries like Greece. But in the green zone, where the sovereign is in the comfortable position of being able to fund itself at reasonable'or even exceptionally low'interest rates, and there is no real possibility of a debt-induced sovereign crisis, living with debt, and allowing the debt ratio to decline organically through growth, may be a better option than deliberately paying it down. Ultimately, this comes down to a cost-benefit analysis. The benefit from repayment is small for countries with ample fiscal space because, while sovereign debt crises are costly when they occur, their occurrence is rare, even at elevated debt levels, and more importantly the probability curve is very flat in the debt level, so that crisis risk hardly falls when debt is reduced from, say, 120 to 100 percent of GDP. The cost of reducing debt can be much larger, however, even if adjustment is spread out over several years (the cost rises steeply if the pace of adjustment is faster), because distortive taxes or cuts in productive spending (needed to run a budgetary surplus) have a deleterious permanent effect on the capital stock, output, and consumption. **Debt is bad for growth** A second argument for paying down the debt is that debt is bad for growth. That is indeed true: the distortionary taxation required for servicing public debt reduces the incentives of both capital and labor, resulting in lower private and public capital stocks, and lower growth. But it does not follow that paying down the debt is good for growth. This is a case where the cure may be worse than the disease: paying down the debt would require further distorting the economy, with a corresponding toll on investment and growth. **Saving for a rainy day ** The third counter argument to just living with the debt is to build additional margins to cope with unanticipated events. The option value of lower debt would be particularly high in the face of catastrophic events (for example, a financial crisis in which a public backstop is essential), in which the government needs to ramp up borrowing massively. If debt is high when such a shock occurs, a heavy penalty may be exacted as sovereign risk premia rise and, in extreme cases, a shutout from the markets would ensue. Put simply, debt needs to be reduced today to save for a rainy day tomorrow. This argument has considerable merit'even for countries in the 'green zone'\u009d'but again it is a matter of balance. Lower debt provides larger margins for unexpected contingencies, but if it comes at the cost of investment and output growth, the margin may be somewhat illusory. That is why we argue in our paper that, while the nominal value of the debt should not be paid down, the debt ratio should be allowed to decline organically. **No mechanical exercise** Advanced economies are contending with some of the highest debt ratios seen since the Second World War. But not all are in the same boat: for some, whose sustainability is more precarious, reducing debt is the imperative. Others are in a more ambiguous situation where there is no immediate risk of funding problems but nor is there any room for complacency. And a few appear to be in the 'green zone'\u009d with ample fiscal space. Of course, deciding which zone a country is in is not a mechanical exercise but will require judgments based on stress testing fiscal balance sheets to withstand extreme shocks. But the mantra that it is always desirable to reduce public debt must not go unquestioned. A comparison of costs and benefits must underpin policy advice. For countries in the green zone, the case for living with the debt is a strong one.

Given the distinctive nature of EU integration, the framework aims to discipline national fiscal policies to prevent adverse spillovers to other countries and distortions to the conduct of the euro area's common monetary policy. The build-up of fiscal imbalances, however, revealed gaps in the framework. Public debt in the European Union soared following the crisis in 2008 to an average of around 95 percent in 2014'almost 30 percentage points above its average pre-crisis level (Chart 1). [ Rooted in the EU treaties and the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), successive reforms to the fiscal framework'including the 2005 reforms, the 2011 Six Pack, the 2012 Fiscal Compact, and the 2013 Two Pack'have brought many positive elements, including a stronger economic underpinning to the rules-based system, better alignment of fiscal targets with debt objectives, and improved coordination and conduct of fiscal policy. But they have also increased its complexity. The current framework involves multiple intricate rules that hamper effective monitoring and public communication (Chart 2). Compliance with the framework could also be improved. In our new [paper, we discuss medium-term reform options to simplify the framework and enhance compliance. [ **A single fiscal anchor and a single operational rule** The dual objectives of safeguarding fiscal sustainability and maintaining simplicity suggest a two-pillar approach to the design of the fiscal framework, with _a single fiscal anchor_ and _a single operational rule_ that acts as the lever that moves the anchor. * **_Debt as the anchor_**_._ The ultimate objective of the fiscal governance framework should be to ensure fiscal sustainability in the form of public debt sustainability. Public debt-to-GDP ratio is considered a natural anchor for capturing repeated (cumulative) fiscal slippages that flow variables, like the budget deficit, would not capture. While public debt can be affected by factors other than fiscal actions, like financing operations that are unrelated to budget deficits (like financial sector bailouts or valuation effects), there is no good alternative to using the public debt-to-GDP ratio as the fiscal anchor. * **_An expenditure growth rule as the operational rule_**_._ A good operational rule should support countercyclical fiscal policy (economic stabilization) and provide a strong link to the fiscal anchor. Moreover, the rule should provide operational guidance (by being under the control of policymakers and having a direct link to discretionary budgetary measures) and be transparent (that is, easy to communicate to the public). An expenditure growth rule (possibly with an explicit debt correction mechanism or debt brake) as the operational rule linked to the anchor does a good job of satisfying these requirements. It generates low medium-term variability of output (Chart 3), has a clear link to budgetary actions (by constraining real expenditures), and is more straightforward to communicate. [ **Improving compliance** Beyond such simplification, additional reforms could help improve implementation of the fiscal framework and support compliance. The preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact could be merged or at the least, the rules in the two arms could be more harmonized. Making the gradual step-up of monitoring and constraints more automatic could improve enforcement. Corrective actions and sanctions could also be formulated to better reflect economic realities (monetary fines in a downturn are not credible). The transition towards a reformed fiscal framework would take time. Some reforms may face legal obstacles, and in some cases, wholesale treaty changes may be needed. However, working for a simpler and more robust fiscal framework may be the best response to recent skepticism about the European project.

Millions of families have been lifted from extreme poverty, and access to education and health has improved thanks to a series of well-targeted social interventions, such as _Bolsa Familia_, the conditional cash transfer program. I was privileged to see some of this tangible progress during my visit to Brazil last week. I met with Tereza Campello, Brazil's Minister for Social Development, who explained the network of social programs in the country, and guided us on a visit to _Complexo do Alem\u00c3\u00a3o_'a neighborhood and a group of _favelas_ in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro. We got there after a ride on the recently built cable car, which links several neighborhoods on the hills to the North Zone. This is a great example of infrastructure that has contributed immensely to improving the economic opportunities of people, who now have a quick way to move around and connect to the larger city. The stations themselves are also focal points of the efforts aimed at improving the daily lives of the people of Rio de Janeiro, since they house important services such as the youth center, a social assistance center, a public library, a training center for micro-entrepreneurs, and even a small branch of the bank that distributes the _Bolsa Familia_ monthly grants. At the _Alem\u00c3\u00a3o_ station, I met several women who have become successful entrepreneurs in their own communities with the support of programs aimed at micro-entrepreneurs. Women like Regina Celia, who explained how she can now go to work thanks to the availability of day care services; Solange, who has a small cosmetics business; and Cristiane, who manages a hostel. I also saw some of their children, who were practicing _capoeira_, a Brazilian martial art (or a dance perhaps!) at the youth center. All their stories were uplifting and I was impressed by the efforts to empower women so that they can be successful, independent entrepreneurs in their communities. This visit gave concrete meaning to Finance Minister Joaquim Levy's often repeated statement that a main goal of strengthening Brazil's public finances is to make sure that the suite of social programs can be sustained over time. Encouragingly, the Brazilian government is pursuing such a strategy: * To stabilize gross public debt, the government announced a primary surplus target of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and at least 2 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017, which, along with the end of policy lending to banks, should put public debt on a declining path. * A key element in the policy strategy is to reduce or eliminate inefficient, untargeted, and costly subsidies'and here the government has adjusted key administered prices, notably those of electricity and fuels. * At the same time, the central bank is aiming to bring inflation down to the 4.5 percent target and to help prevent second round effects from the increases in administered prices and the depreciation of the _real_. While economic policies may affect demand in the short term, they will benefit all the Brazilian people in the longer run. Indeed, at the Central Bank's Inflation Targeting Seminar, I [noted that as these measures take hold, the favorable effects on credibility and confidence should enable a return to positive growth in 2016. To support this, the government is also taking important supply-side measures such as the infrastructure concession program. The IMF's recent [report on the Brazilian economy discusses other reforms geared at improving competitiveness and increasing the economy's productive potential'some of which the government is now considering. Given the continued slowdown in global demand, there is no question that Brazil'like other countries in Latin America'is facing a more difficult external environment. The economic policies now being undertaken are putting the country back on the right track'the big challenge now is implementation. The IMF supports Brazil's efforts to strengthen its fiscal and monetary policies while maintaining its successful social policies. These were some of the issues that I discussed in my meetings with President Dilma Rousseff, Ministers Levy and Nelson Barbosa, and Governor Alexandre Tombini. We agreed that with perseverance and the right policy choices, a brighter outlook for Brazil is within reach.

The ability to trade in assets of any size, at any time and to find a ready buyer is not a given. As discussed in some detail [last fall in this blog, a number of factors, including the evolving structure of financial markets and some regulations appear to have pushed liquidity into a new realm: markets look susceptible to episodes of high price volatility where liquidity suddenly vanishes. In our April 2015 [_Global Financial Stability Report_ we identify a new aspect to the problem: asset price correlations have risen sharply in the last five years across all major asset classes (see figure). [ This increase has been associated with episodes of decreased market liquidity. We also show that asset price correlations edge higher as volatility in financial markets increases, virtually across all major asset classes. This increase in correlations' spillovers is a characteristic of financial contagion. **Chances that something goes wrong are higher** We've had a few foretastes of the possibility of markets becoming illiquid: the October 15, 2014 flash rally which recorded one of the largest falls and then rise over the last quarter century in the most liquid market in the world, U.S. Treasury bonds; and the dislocation in foreign exchange markets following the Swiss central bank's unexpected decision to end its policy curbing the value of its currency. This risk of illiquidity is even more significant in many advanced economy corporate bond markets, as well as in bond markets in emerging economies that are experiencing large inflows from investment funds. Fortunately, such liquidity crunch episodes have so far not exerted long- lasting adverse impact. But the evaporation of market liquidity today could result in more market stress with potentially adverse knock-on impact on the global economy and financial stability. **In this context, the risk that shocks could trigger a rapid erosion of liquidity in typically well-functioning markets has increased due to two factors.** **_Geo-politics and the oil price decline set the stage_**. The very steep and rapid decrease in oil prices in the second half of 2014 put considerable strain on U.S. high yield corporate bonds markets'where energy companies account for 15 percent of the market' and on oil exporting emerging economy government bond markets. Even when oil prices have partly recovered from last year's sharp decline, the volatility of oil prices remains high, indicating ongoing concerns of market participants about future oil prices. **_Different monetary policies and a stronger dollar may provide a test of market resilience_**. Notwithstanding uncertainties regarding timing and pace, the United States looks set to begin tightening interest rates later this year, having already ended asset purchases last year. This is in marked contrast to the Euro Area and Japan, where policymakers are expected to continue very accommodative monetary policies in the near term. This has set the stage for the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Stronger growth in the United States, the ultimate driver, is good news for the global economy, but the interest rate rise and prospect of further dollar appreciation could result in capital outflows from emerging economies and from high yield corporate bond markets back into U.S. Treasuries. This could test market liquidity in high yield and emerging economy bond markets and adversely affect financial stability. ** Policies to enhance market liquidity** **_First,_** we need **policies to strengthen market structures, even in government bond markets**. Regulators should enact policies to encourage market participants to provide liquidity in normal trading conditions. This could include rewarding primary dealers with incentives or obligating them to trade passively (by providing quotes) or actively (by actual transactions). These measures need not require market makers to maintain a constant presence during unusual bouts of extreme volatility. Instead, regulators can design circuit-breakers that are triggered during these rare events, halting disorderly trading conditions and allowing time for liquidity to replenish. In fact, by buttressing participation in secondary markets in normal conditions, authorities may forestall the very deterioration of trading liquidity that could require the use of these circuit-breakers. **_Second,_** regulators and central banks should take **_urgent steps to ensure continued market liquidity_**, not just in good times but also under conditions of stress. At the national level, this includes enhanced micro- and [macroprudential frameworks to enhance oversight of liquidity within mutual funds and also at the level of financial markets. This requires effective tools such as ensuring that redemption terms in the asset management sector are better aligned with underlying market liquidity conditions. National supervisors should coordinate and provide consistent guidance to trading firms across major jurisdictions regarding the appropriate risk limits on individual retail investors, exchanges and clearing firms. **_Third, regulators and central banks ought to examine and exploit cross-border synergies in policies_**, including the preemptive creation of central bank swap lines that were so vital during the last crisis. Regulators and monetary authorities should also take into account the dynamics posed by increased global asset correlations and periods of volatility when evaluating systemic risks in financial markets.

These estimates are shocking. The figure likely exceeds government health spending across the world, estimated by the World Health Organization at 6 percent of global GDP, but for the different year of 2013. They correspond to one of the largest negative externality ever estimated. They have global relevance. And that's not all: earlier [work by the IMF also shows that these [subsidies have adverse effects on economic efficiency, growth, and inequality. **What are energy subsidies** We define energy subsidies as the difference between what consumers pay for energy and its 'true costs,'\u009d plus a country's normal value added or sales tax rate. These 'true costs'\u009d of energy consumption include its supply costs and the damage that energy consumption inflicts on people and the environment. These damages, in turn, come from carbon emissions and hence global warming; the health effects of air pollution; and the effects on traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and road damage. Most of these externalities are borne by local populations, with the global warming component of energy subsidies only a fourth of the total (Chart 1). [ Energy subsidies are both large and widespread. They are pervasive across advanced and developing countries. Emerging Asia accounts for about half of the total, while advanced economies account for about a quarter (Chart 2). The largest subsidies, in absolute terms, are in China (US$2.3 trillion), the United States (US$699 billion), Russia (US$335 billion), India (US$277 billion), and Japan (US$157 billion). For the European Union, subsidies are also substantial (US$330 billion). [ **Larger than previously thought** The number for 2015 is more than double the US$2 trillion we had previously estimated for 2011. Over half of the increase is explained by more refined country-level evidence on the damaging effects of energy consumption on air quality and health. An accompanying blog from our colleagues Sanjeev Gupta and Michael Keen explains in more detail the differences in the estimates. A technical discussion of our estimates is provided in an IMF [working paper by David Coady and others. While the large size of our new estimates may be surprising, it is important to put in perspective just how many health problems are linked to energy consumption and air quality. In China alone, the World Health Organization estimates there are over one million premature deaths per year due to outdoor air pollution, caused by the burning of polluting fuels, particularly coal, and other sources. Many countries have made significant strides in tackling energy subsidies. More recently, several countries have narrowed the gap between domestic prices and international prices, which reduced subsidy spending by US$ 190 billion between 2011 and 2015. Countries that have reformed subsidies include Angola, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia, and Yemen. As we indicated in an earlier blog ([Oil Prices and Public Finances: A double-Edged Sword), lower oil prices provide a golden opportunity for countries to continue to advance energy subsidy reform. The recent experience of India is instructive. In October 2014, diesel prices were fully liberalized, which followed a period of gradual subsidy reform. Efforts have also been made to limit the cost of subsidies to liquid petroleum gas (LPG). This includes the expansion of a direct cash benefit scheme throughout the country, in January 2015, to replace access to subsidized LPG. This reform ensures that low income households will be protected while reducing the budgetary cost of subsidies. **Getting energy prices right** Despite reform efforts in many countries, energy prices remain woefully below levels that reflect their true costs. Does resolving this problem need to wait for a global solution? The IMF has long argued that getting energy prices right can help national governments achieve their goals not only for the environment but also for inclusive growth and sound public finances. Increasing energy prices gradually and predictably to reflect their true costs would generate fiscal gains of about 3\u00c2? percent of GDP. The fiscal gains are less than the total amount of subsidies (6\u00c2? percent of GDP) because higher prices would drive down energy consumption. The fiscal gains from subsidy reform are sizeable and could be a game changer for fiscal policy in many countries. This would give room, for example, for governments to reduce some types of taxes (such as those imposed on labor) that weigh down growth; raise growth-enhancing public expenditure (e.g. for infrastructure, health and education); and finance targeted cash transfers for the poor. Furthermore, there would be appropriate incentives for investment in green technology because dirty energy would no longer be artificially cheap. The icing on the cake is that the benefits from subsidy reform'for example, from reduced pollution'would overwhelmingly accrue to local populations. **Start the process now, at the national level** Even if motivated purely by national reasons, energy subsidy reform would have favorable effects globally. Take, for example, the case where countries raise prices purely with domestic considerations in mind, that is, without adding in a correction for global warming. This would nevertheless help reduce global C02 emissions by about 17 percent. Conditions are ripe to decisively engage in energy taxation and energy subsidy reform, further favored by lower international oil prices and low inflation. Steps at the national level could hasten progress at the global level ahead of the Paris climate change summit in December. The fiscal implications are mammoth: at US$5.3 trillion, energy subsidies exceed the estimated public health spending for the entire globe. It also exceeds the world's total public investment spending. The resources freed from subsidy reform could be used to meet critical public spending needs or reduce taxes that are choking economic growth. By acting local, and in their own best interest, policy authorities can contribute significantly to the solution of a global challenge. The path forward is thus clear: act local, solve global.

This blog sets out what we mean by 'energy subsidies,'\u009d provides details on their estimation, and explains how they continue to be high despite the recent drop in international energy prices (Chart 1). [ Our [latest update of global energy subsidies shows that '_pre-tax_'\u009d subsidies'which occur when people and businesses pay less than it costs to supply the energy'are smaller than a few years back. But '_post-tax_'\u009d subsidies'which add to _pre-tax_ subsidies an amount that reflects the environmental, health and other damage that energy use causes and the benefit from favorable VAT or sales tax treatment'remain extremely high, and indeed are now well above our previous estimates. While pre-tax subsidies have fallen, the efficiency costs of failing to charge for environmental and other damage and secure a contribution to revenues are even larger than we previously thought. So the urgent need for energy price reform'in a wide range of both advanced and developing countries'remains. Low international oil prices have not made the problem go away. But they provide a great opportunity to move towards more efficient pricing of energy. **Pre- vs. post-tax subsidies** In [an earlier study, the IMF estimated that global _pre-tax_ subsidies amounted to US$492 billion (0.7 percent of Global GDP) in 2011, with nearly half of this attributable to a few oil-exporting developing economies. That study also introduced the broader concept of _post-tax_ subsidies simply recognizes that: * environmental damage'including global warming, local pollution, traffic congestion and accidents'from energy consumption is just as real as are traditional supply costs (even if harder to measure) and the prices that consumers pay should reflect these negative 'externalities.'\u009d There are in principle other instruments that are better suited for addressing some of these externalities, for example, congestion charges for road congestion. But taxes on energy use remain the most practical, effective and efficient instruments until these alternatives become more widely practicable ([Parry and others, 2014); and * the need for revenue applies just as much to energy products as to any other good. This means that energy should be subject to the standard rate of VAT or other general consumption tax. So, think of the failure to price accordingly as a form of subsidy. Indeed such estimates have now come to be widely used, including in [a recent paper by the European Commission. Estimating _post-tax_ subsidies involves measuring and valuing environmental damages that are often uncertain and very country-specific, as well as needing to place some monetary value on human life. In 2013, when we first made our estimates of _post-tax_ subsidies, we estimated post-tax subsidies for 2011 at a striking worldwide total of around US$2.0 trillion (2.9 percent of global GDP). Importantly, they were estimated to be widespread across both advanced and developing economies, underscoring the need for energy price reform worldwide. At that time, however, very little was known about the magnitude of environmental damages from fossil fuel consumption on a country-by-country basis. That study simply extrapolated from just three available studies (for the United States, the United Kingdom and Chile). Now, we incorporate the more refined estimates of environmental damages for fossil fuel products from [a recent IMF book. We also update price, consumption and income data. **Old vs. new estimates** In our update, _pre-tax_ subsidies are estimated at US$541 billion (0.7 percent of global GDP) in 2013 (the most recent year for which data are available), and projected to decline to around US$333 billion (0.4 percent of global GDP) in 2015, due to falling international energy prices and less than full pass-through of reduced international prices into domestic consumer prices. Global _post-tax_ energy subsidies are now estimated at a whopping US$4.9 trillion (6.5 percent of global GDP) in 2013, and projected to remain high in 2015, at US$5.3 trillion (6.5 percent of global GDP)'despite the recent drop in international energy prices (Chart 2). [ This significant increase of the _post-tax_ subsidies from those we previously estimated for 2011 can be explained as follows: * About 40 percent comes from inflation, real income growth, and updating prices and consumption of energy products; * About 30 percent is from estimating environmental damages by using country-specific data on air pollution emission rates (for power plants and vehicles), the number of people exposed to air pollution, and traffic congestion and accidents, and so on; * About 15 percent is from including damages for which estimates were not previously available (nitrogen oxides and direct fine particulate emissions from power plants); and * About 15 percent is from incorporating new evidence from the World Health Organization (WHO) on how pollution exposure increases risks of various diseases. **Fiscal gains from energy price reform** Importantly, the revenue gain from energy price reform will be substantially smaller than these estimated subsidies, because firms and households would cut their energy consumption and adopt emissions control technologies if energy prices were to be raised. Allowing for such responses as best we can, we put the revenue gain from eliminating _post-tax_ subsidies in 2013 at US$3.0 trillion (4.0 percent of global GDP) and project it to be nearly US$2.9 trillion (3.6 percent of global GDP) in 2015. This is a very substantial fiscal dividend that could be used for growth-enhancing tax cuts on labor and capital or badly needed investments in basic education and health. At the same time, energy price reforms substantially reduce the need to subsidize renewable energies and are the most effective policies for promoting opportunities to mitigate environmental impacts across the economy.

This trend has raised concerns not only because weaker investment has played an important role in the broader regional slowdown, but also because Latin America's investment rates were lower than in most other regions even before the slowdown began. [ This blog looks at the drivers of corporate investment and highlights the extent to which falling commodity export prices have contributed to lower capital spending. Given the poor outlook for commodity prices and what our analysis suggests, this does not bode well for countries in the region going forward unless they can tackle some of the long-standing obstacles to increase investment. **Latin America's low investment problem** From the perspective of Latin America's economic history, the recent investment slowdown does not appear particularly alarming. As shown in our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook__, _the average ratio of investment to GDP has fallen about two percentage points from its 2008 peak, but at 19.6 percent remains slightly above the historical average (see Chart 2). However, the share of investment to GDP has persisted significantly below the comparable values from other emerging market regions, which arguably represents an important constraint on potential growth in Latin America. [ **Micro and macro drivers of corporate investment** It is thus all the more important to understand the dynamics of corporate investment'which accounts for the bulk of overall private investment'and why it has slowed so markedly in recent years. To answer these questions, we study firm-level data for a large data set spanning 24 years and 38 countries, with a total of close to 500,000 company-year observations. We relate the individual firm's investment-to-capital ratio to a number of firm-specific variables that other studies have focused on'these include expected profitability, cash flows, leverage, and net borrowing. As an innovation, we add several macro-level variables to the model that strike us as particularly relevant for emerging markets. Specifically, we focus on the role of commodity export prices and capital inflows, which have moved in sync with aggregate private investment growth in Latin America over the past decade. Presumably, the ampler the supply of international capital, the less firm investment will be constrained by finance. Meanwhile, higher commodity export prices could stimulate investment'both directly, for commodity-related firms, and indirectly, as economies as a whole receive a positive income windfall (see Chart 3). [ Our results show that both the micro-level and macro-level variables are important for understanding corporate investment. Regarding the former, firms that are expected to be more profitable tend to invest more. We also find that firms are financially constrained (in the sense that they rely on internal cash flow to finance their investment) and those with higher existing debt burdens tend to invest less. Turning to the effects of macroeconomic variables, commodity export prices stand out as a key factor affecting corporate investment. The more commodity export prices rise, the larger the additional investment of the average firm. In Latin America, a one standard deviation shock to commodity export prices (a change of over 10 percentage points) tends to increase the average firm's investment-capital ratio by nearly 4 percentage points. Importantly, this result holds across all sectors in our data set, and not just in the narrowly defined commodity sector. We also find that times of larger capital inflows coincide with higher corporate investment. Indeed, capital inflows help to relax firms' financial constraints, particularly for firms that produce nontradable goods. **Understanding the recent slowdown** Can these general results also shed light on what has happened since mid-2011? The answer is a clear yes. Although the recent slowdown marks a significant change in investment dynamics, we find that it can still be well explained by the variables in our regression, implying that the relationship between investment and the drivers we examine has not changed in recent years. Rather, some of those drivers have moved sharply since 2011, causing correspondingly sharp moves in investment ratios (see Chart 4). For Latin America, in particular, lower commodity export prices account for almost the entire decline in average investment-to-capital ratios. In other regions, commodity prices have also played a role, but other factors have contributed significantly, too'including capital inflows, expected profitability, leverage, and financial constraints. [ **Reviving private investment** With commodity prices generally expected to remain subdued, the outlook for the period ahead is discouraging. Capital flows to emerging markets could also moderate, particularly as U.S. monetary policy starts to normalize. In addition, potential output projections for emerging economies have been revised downward further, thus reducing firms' expected profitability. While this implies little boost to investment from cyclical factors, there is nonetheless scope for supportive policy action. For Latin America, some of the long-standing obstacles to higher investment arguably include low domestic saving rates, weak educational outcomes, and challenging business environments in many countries. Tackling these weaknesses is the best strategy for policymakers to revive private investment dynamics and boost medium-term growth prospects, even more so in a less benign external environment.

The flow of affordable credit from banks was choked off and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were hit hardest. Today, with bank lending still recovering from that shock, smart policy actions could open up securitization as a source of financing to help small businesses start up, flourish and grow. SMEs are vital to the European economy. They account for 99 out of every 100 businesses, two in every three employees, and 58 cents of each euro of value added of the business sector in Europe. Improving access to finance would therefore not only revive small businesses, but also support a strong and lasting recovery for Europe as a whole. Europe's small businesses rely heavily on banks for credit. In 2014, more than two-thirds of SMEs in Europe used bank financing, while less than one fifth used non-bank financing sources, such as equity and debt securities (Chart 1). This dependence makes them vulnerable to banking sector difficulties. When the crisis hit, banks raised interest rates and rationed credit to SMEs more tightly than for larger firms. [ **Quick and lasting gains** Greater use of securitization could yield both quick wins and lasting gains as European Union countries move toward more integrated capital markets. It could help SMEs attract non-bank funding, since banks would sell securitized loans to investors. And from the perspective of banks, the process would free up capital to support new lending. In the long run SMEs will also need direct access to bond markets, private equity, and venture capital. But the scope to mobilize additional funding now through securitization is considerable, given the large existing stock of SME loans.

[Regional growth is expected to dip below 1 percent in 2015, partly as a result of the drop in global commodity prices. How well placed is the region for the coming lean times? Countries face this slowdown from much weaker fiscal positions than when the global financial crisis hit. Then, Latin America responded strongly with expansionary fiscal policies, including explicit fiscal stimulus programs in many countries. But, as growth has recovered, this increase in spending has proved difficult to reverse. [Our new study looks at six large emerging countries of Latin America'Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay'how they reacted to the global financial crisis, the longer-term consequences of their policy choices, and the main lessons for policymakers. **The golden decade** In the decade before the crisis, Latin America experienced a renaissance'strong growth, high commodity prices, buoyant investor optimism, and better policy frameworks. Public debt went down, there was less reliance on dollar-denominated borrowing, and foreign exchange reserves were built up. Most countries avoided the temptation of going on an excessive spending spree during these boom years, despite pressing social and public infrastructure needs. However, countries could have done more to pay down debts and prepare for the rainy days to come. Nevertheless, at the start of the crisis, their fiscal positions were in good shape. [ **The storm** While the global financial crisis originated outside the region, it initially hit Latin America hard through the drop in commodity prices and global trade. The discipline maintained in the past decade paid off though. Instead of tightening fiscal policy and adding to recessionary forces, as Latin America had often been forced to do in the past, countries were able to implement a more expansionary policy stance, with explicit fiscal stimulus programs in five out of the six countries. These programs helped to reduce output losses by about 0.75 to 2 percent of GDP. **The aftermath** After the crisis, Latin America bounced back strongly, helped by the quick recovery of commodity prices and wide availability of global financing. However, as it recovered, countries could not resist the temptation to go back to their old, procyclical ways. With the exception of Chile, countries in the region insufficiently tightened fiscal policy as they found it difficult to cut spending back to pre-crisis levels, even as they headed quickly back to full employment. **Crisis legacies** Today, many countries in Latin America are in a weaker fiscal position. In fact, their fiscal accounts are weaker now than on the eve of the crisis. While fiscal deficits and debt levels are not alarming, fiscal vulnerabilities have increased, eroding the room for maneuver. If another crisis were to hit tomorrow, most of Latin America would find it difficult to respond with the same vigorous fiscal support as they did in 2009. [ The structure of public finances has also changed. Spending on wages and social benefits has been ratcheted up and will be politically difficult to reverse. Revenue increases are helping to close the gaps but there is perhaps a need to reconsider the desired size of government and how much taxation the population can tolerate to fund those public services. [ A more pervasive and less evident legacy has been the weakening of the region's fiscal institutions. While some rule bending may have been understandable given the extraordinary global events of 2008'09, there was little effort to re-anchor fiscal objectives and return to prudent and transparent frameworks during the boom years. For many, the weakening of fiscal institutions and controls has become a permanent feature'with changes to the targets and coverage of the fiscal rules and some off-budget operations. **Main takeaways** A few key lessons emerge from Latin America's experiences over the past decade: * **Countercyclical fiscal policy'if it is applied at all'should be used symmetrically**. A major fiscal stimulus during a crisis needs to be offset with fiscal conservatism as times get better. * **Fiscal institutions need to be strengthened**. They should be designed to support a prudent buildup of buffers during good times while providing flexibility to react as headwinds build. Countries should set their goals in terms of structural balance targets that adjust for the cycle and movements in commodity prices. Alternatively, expenditure rules could be used as a technically easier option. There should be well-defined escape clauses for those unexpected catastrophes like we saw following the failure of Lehman Brothers. There should also be safeguards put in place to ensure that fiscal authorities work to make up for lost ground, once the dark clouds of crisis dissipate. * **The region has ample scope to improve the efficiency of its public spending**. This would help to cope with increasing demands for public services while containing spending pressures. Smarter adjustments may take more time to identify and implement, but will help build social support for addressing the imbalances that have accrued post-crisis. ** ** ", "index": 222}, {"pub": "5/5/2015", "title": "European Life Insurers: Unsustainable Business Model", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=9527", "content": " By [Reinout De Bock, [Andrea Maechler, and [Nobuyasu Sugimoto ( Low interest rates in the euro area pose substantial challenges to the life insurance industry. Insurers'particularly in Germany and Sweden'offer their clients long-term policies, sometimes more than 30 years, without holding assets of a correspondingly long duration. Moreover, many policies contain generous return guarantees, which are unsustainable in today's low interest rate environment. **In 2014, stress tests showed European life insurers are vulnerable to a 'Japanese-like'\u009d scenario.** [Stress tests conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority revealed the scale and urgency of this problem. This exercise showed that under a 'Japanese-like'\u009d scenario with a prolonged period of low interest rates nearly a quarter of insurers were not able to meet their regulatory requirements (red line in Figure 1). As a whole, the industry was expected to have about 8'11 years before running into serious cash-flow pressures. **These results are more alarming than they appear** First, Europe is now facing a more severe scenario than the one used in the stress test, with interest rates that are significantly lower and expected to remain at low levels for some time (black line in Figure 1). Under those lower rates, two things are unclear: how many life insurers cannot meet their regulatory requirements today and how quickly this number is likely to increase over time. [ Second, regulatory adjustments (the so-called Solvency II 'Long-Term Guarantee'\u009d adjustments) help mitigate the short-term impact of stress but may not be realistic under industry-wide stress. Such adjustments help individual life insurers overcome temporary capital shortfalls but they become more problematic when the entire industry suffers from the same low interest rate environment for an extended period. For example, under a Japanese-like scenario, regulatory adjustments would make the value of insurers' assets grow faster than that of their liabilities. But in a prolonged low interest rate environment, the present discounted value of future liabilities should rise by more than the value of assets as assets that mature will need to be reinvested at lower yields. **Some European life insurers are particularly vulnerable to failure** Mid-sized insurers with guaranteed returns and long-dated liabilities that are not matched by similarly long-dated assets face a particularly high and rising risk of failure. According to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, more than half of European life insurers are guaranteeing a return to investors that exceeds the yield on the local 10-year government bond, thereby incurring undesirable negative investment spreads. In Germany, for example, despite a recent reduction to 1.25 percent on new products, the guaranteed return on total policies is about 3.2 percent, relative to a 10-year bond yield of about 0.3 percent. The problem is compounded for insurers that suffer from large duration mismatches (when assets are shorter-dated than liabilities). Maturing assets need to be re-invested at the current lower yields and will not appreciate enough to offset the higher value of longer-term liabilities, especially when fixed at guaranteed rates. Germany and Sweden, which together accounted for about 20 percent of gross written premiums at the end of 2013, exhibit both duration mismatches of more than 10 years as well as negative investment spreads. Life insurance markets are quite different between countries. In the United States, life insurance companies appear less sensitive to the risks associated with low interest rates, reflecting their product mix and the more favorable U.S. economic outlook. In the late 1990s, the Japanese life insurance industry was facing similar problems to the German and Swedish life insurers today, with high guaranteed rates and large duration mismatches. It took more than 20 years and the failure of eight mid-size insurers for the industry to lower its guaranteed rates and shorten duration mismatches. **Contagion to the broader financial system**_ _ The failure of one or more mid-sized insurer could trigger an industry-wide loss of confidence if it is perceived to reflect an industry-wide problem likely to spread to other institutions. The complexity of insurance business and limited financial public disclosure may also contribute to such contagion. The absence of a policyholder protection scheme or a set of common minimum standards for the entire European Union'which exist in Japan and the United States'magnifies such risks. The high and rising interconnectedness between the insurance industry and the wider European Union financial system is another source of potential spillovers. The industry is the largest institutional investor with an exposure of '\u00ac4.4 trillion to the European private sector (Figure 2). For example, severe cash flow pressures in one insurance company could trigger fire sales, forcing other institutions to recognize a mark-to-market price adjustment that could engulf the entire financial system. [ **What can policymakers do?** Regulators need to promptly tackle the challenges facing life insurers. They need to reassess the viability of guarantee-based products and work to bring minimum return guarantees offered to policyholders in line with secular trends in interest rates. Regulators and supervisors should also seek to mitigate the damaging impact from potential difficulties in individual insurers. Introducing a more harmonized safety net, which protects policyholders, and ensuring adequate regulatory tools to deal promptly with weak institutions, would further increase the resilience of the industry. Finally, regulators should continue to improve transparency and public disclosure of life insurers. Despite the significant efforts by European regulators to strengthen transparency, including through the publication of comprehensive stress test results, it remains difficult to assess insurers' true solvency position.

The U.S. experience shone a spotlight on the dangers of financial systems that have grown exponentially and beyond traditional banks. It triggered a rethinking of the extent and speed of the expansion of a country's financial sector, and raised questions about which policies promote a safe financial system. In our [new study, we emphasize that the most commonly used indicator'bank credit'is not sufficient to measure the size and scope of a country's financial development. We create a comprehensive index for over 170 countries to answer several policy questions from the perspective of emerging markets. We show that financial development entails tradeoffs. Our analysis uncovers evidence of 'too much finance'\u009d in the sense that beyond a certain level of financial development, the positive effect on economic growth begins to decline, while costs in terms of economic and financial volatility begin to rise (see figure below). The analysis shows that these tradeoffs can be improved by strong institutions and a sound regulatory and supervisory environment. In other words, regulatory reforms can increase the benefits from financial development while reducing the risks. We find that the gains for growth as well as for economic and financial stability from further financial development remain large for most emerging markets. But there are speed limits on financial deepening: when financial sectors deepen too fast, it often leads to crises and instability. Moreover, we find it is better for countries to develop financial institutions first, and then markets. Strengthening regulations also matters. In fact, there is little trade-off between growth and stability when it comes to deciding on which regulatory principles to focus on'they are key for both. [ **What we mean by 'too much finance'\u009d** We measure financial development by a combination of three elements: * **Depth** ' the size and liquidity of financial institutions and markets; * **Access** - the ability of individuals to access financial services; and * **Efficiency **- the ability of institutions to provide financial services at low cost and with sustainable revenues, and the level of activity of capital markets. The 'too much finance'\u009d effect reflects primarily the impact of a country's financial development on total factor productivity growth. High financial development does not impede capital accumulation. However, it leads to a loss of efficiency in investment. This suggests that the quality of finance'for instance, allocation of financial resources toward productive activities'begins to decline.** ** **Emerging markets still benefit from financial development ** Most developing and emerging economies are still in relatively safe territory when it comes to financial development. In countries such as Gambia, Ecuador, and Morocco, further financial development is clearly growth-enhancing. That is, they can achieve higher growth and financial stability, and reduce economic volatility by developing their financial systems further. One health warning: risks to financial stability are present even at low levels of financial development. Therefore, policymakers need to ensure that capital and liquidity reserves are in place to mitigate the effects of financial crisis. The benefits from developing financial institutions are large when countries have low income levels, and they decline as country income level increases, whereas the opposite is true for markets. Thus, when it comes to financial development, an appropriate sequencing would emphasize developing institutions in the early stages, with increasing attention to developing markets as per capita income rises. Interestingly, we find that raising access to finance and financial sector efficiency is beneficial for growth at any level of financial development. In other words, the weakening effect on growth at higher levels of financial development stems from financial deepening, not access or efficiency.** ** **Speed limits** A faster pace of financial deepening means greater risks of crisis and economic instability, other things being equal. There is a clear positive relationship between the speed at which financial institutions grow and financial instability. This is because when financial institutions grow fast, they often do so by taking on too much risk and leverage, particularly when the system is poorly regulated and supervised. Building strong institutions and regulations helps increase a country's benefits from financial development while reducing the risks. Better protection of property rights, creditor rights and information, higher regulatory quality and rule of law are positively associated with financial development.** ** **Better regulation promotes both financial development and stability**** ** There have been fears that sweeping changes to global regulatory frameworks would curtail credit, hamper financial development, and [stifle growth. Indeed, one effect of global regulatory reforms has been that banks in advanced economies have increased their capital and in some cases also reduced their assets to unwind some of the pre-crisis excesses. The empirical evidence in our study shows that of the 93 regulatory principles contained in international standards for regulation and supervision of banks, insurance companies, and securities markets, the critical principles that matter for financial development and stability are essentially the same. These principles capture regulators' ability to act by setting and demanding adjustments to capital, loan loss provisioning, and employee compensation. They also include transparent financial reporting and disclosures. This means that better'not necessarily more'regulation is what promotes financial stability and development. ** ** ", "index": 224}, {"pub": "5/1/2015", "title": "Ten Take Aways from the \u201cRethinking Macro Policy:  Progress or Confusion?\u201d", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=9503", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard On April 15-16, the IMF organized the third conference on \"[Rethinking Macro Policy.\" Here are my personal take aways. **1\\. What will be the \"new normal\"? ** I had asked the panelists to concentrate not on current policy challenges, but on challenges in the \"new normal.\" I had implicitly assumed that this new normal would be very much like the old normal, one of decent growth and positive equilibrium interest rates. The assumption was challenged at the conference. On the one hand, [Ken Rogoff argued that what we were in the adjustment phase of the 'debt supercycle.'\u009d Such financial cycles, he argued, end up with debt overhang, which in turn slows down the recovery and requires low interest rates for some time to maintain sufficient demand. Under that view, while it may take a while for the overhang to go away, more so in the Euro zone than in the United States, we should eventually return to something like the old normal. On the other hand, Larry Summers argued that, while debt overhang was clearly relevant, more was going on. He expanded on his secular stagnation hypothesis, arguing that, in the context of a chronic excess of saving over investment, keeping the economy at potential may well require very low or even negative real interest rates. He pointed out that real interest rates had started declining long before the crisis, and pointed also to the further decline in long rates since he first stated this hypothesis at an IMF conference [last year. If he is right, the new normal will not be like the old normal. My own sense, based on the work we have done at the [IMF and work by others, is that debt overhang is indeed playing a role'although one which varies across countries and type of debtor'but that the decrease in real rates, which was visible before the crisis, is likely to persist in the future. So, I am closer to Summers (although I am not sure that we will need negative rates in the future) than to Rogoff. **2\\. What the new normal will be matters a lot for policy design** If Summers is right, this has major policy implications. If equilibrium real interest rates really are going to be negative, the zero lower bound (or, as we have learned, the 'nearly zero'\u009d lower bound) may make this impossible to achieve. Even if they are positive but close to zero, and if low interest rates lead to excessive risk taking, this may create very tough trade-offs for monetary policy. Instead, fiscal policy may be a more appropriate tool for dealing with the new normal. On the latter, perhaps the most provocative conclusion of the conference was offered by Brad DeLong: If the rate at which the government can borrow (r) is less than the growth rate (g), then, he argued, governments should increase, not decrease, current debt levels. If people value safety so much (and thus the safe rate is so low), then it makes sense for the state to issue safe debt, and possibly use it for productive investment. And if the interest rate is less than the growth rate, debt is safe: the debt- to-GDP ratio will decrease, even if the government never repays the debt. One senses that the argument has strong limits, from the likelihood that r remains less than g (the two letters appear to have become part of the general vocabulary), to the issue of what determines the demand for safe assets, to whether r less than g is an indication of dynamic inefficiency or some distortion, to whether, even if this world, high levels of debt increase the probability of multiple equilibria, rollover crises and sudden stops. **3\\. Can we hope to limit systemic financial risk?** The main underlying theme in the discussion of [financial regulation was whether it had successfully reduced financial risk. There was agreement on \"reduced,\" not so on \"successfully.\" There is little question that new regulations, from Basel III to Dodd Frank, have reduced risk in banking. But some panelists, in particular Anat Admati, argued that this was far from enough, while others argued that the risk had been largely shifted to the shadow banking system. The discussion became granular. The construction of real time systemic risk measures for major banks by the [Vlab at NYU, presented by Viral Acharya, shows how much progress has been made in defining and measuring systemic risk, at least in the banking system. Robert Rubin and Philipp Hildenbrand emphasized the heterogeneity of what is meant by shadow banking, and suggested an approach to regulation of the shadow banking system, focused on functions or activities rather than entities. In a nutshell, if it involves maturity transformation, liquidity mismatch and leverage, then it is banking and needs to be regulated. Yet another theme was the unintended effects of regulation. Acharya argued that incorrect regulatory risk weights had led to systemic risk remaining too high in the European banking system. Rubin and Jaime Caruana discussed the effects of regulation on the reduced role of traditional market makers, and the resulting decrease in market liquidity. **4\\. Should **[**monetary policy**** go back to its old ways? ** Before the crisis, most advanced country central banks had converged to a largely common framework. Some had only one mandate, to keep inflation low and stable; others had a dual mandate, to also keep the economy operating at potential. The main instrument was a policy rate, anchoring the term structure of interest rates. Should this framework be maintained? Ben Bernanke's answer was largely yes. Once economies were out of the zero lower bound, most of the programs introduced during the crisis should be put back on the shelf, ready to be used only if there was another sufficiently adverse shock. The main instrument of monetary policy should again be the federal funds, or, if the central bank wanted to maintain a larger balance sheet and induce banks to hold excess reserves, a combination of the federal funds rate, a repo rate and the rate on excess reserves. Bernanke however raised the issue of composition and size of the balance sheet of the central bank in the new normal, and the issue was taken on by others, in particular Ricardo Caballero. With respect to composition: If, as some argue, there is a \"safe asset shortage,\" does it make sense for central banks to hold, as they did, a large amount of those safe assets? Wouldn't it be better for the central bank to hold other assets, and leave those safe assets in private sector hands? With respect to size: If the central banks are in a unique position to be able to supply safe assets shouldn't they do it? I see this discussion as having just started, raising deep issues about the private demand for safe assets, and the potential role of central bank in this context, both in advanced economies and emerging markets. One question in this context is what is behind the demand for safe assets. Caballero remarked that, if the demand for safe assets is a demand for hedges against macroeconomic fluctuations, long bonds may actually be safer than short bonds or cash: they are more likely to go up in price when times are bad (and the central bank decreases interest rates), thus providing a better hedge against macroeconomic fluctuations. But if the demand is instead for assets with known collateral value, investors will want short bonds. In the first case, the central bank should hold short bonds and leave the long bonds in private hands (the old normal); in the second, the conclusion is the reverse. **5\\. Instrument rules** The [session led to an exchange between Bernanke and John Taylor on the role of 'instrument rules.'\u009d Taylor argued that a deviation by the Fed from a rules-based policy (too loose a monetary policy in the years preceding the crisis), along with a regulatory process which broke rules for safety and soundness, was a key factor in the financial crisis. He argued for a quick return to a rules-based policy for the instruments, what he called \"renormalizing monetary policy.\" Bernanke disagreed and answered that, in the complex world in which we live, the right rule would be very complex, and keeping rigidly to a simple rule would be counterproductive. Judging the central bank on how it fulfills its mandate, rather than requiring it to follow a simple rule, he argued, is the way to proceed. I agree with him. **6\\. Macroprudential tools or financial regulation ** The semantic issue of what is meant by \"[macro prudential tools\" came up, and Paul Tucker suggested the following definition: \"the choice of dynamically adjusting regulatory pararameters so as to maintain systemic resilience.\" The definition is heavy, but helpful. I indeed see the main difference between \"macro prudential tools\" and 'financial regulation'\u009d as the fact that the first are \"dynamically adjusted\" and the second is not. The issue of when one should go for \"dynamically adjusted\" tools, or simply for tougher financial regulation (say, go for variable capital ratios or, instead, for higher but constant capital ratios), which I see as central, was not discussed in this form. Tucker however argued for the use of macro prudential tools to deal with \"exuberance,\" not necessarily for fine tuning in more normal times. Rubin remarked that we were not very good at telling when times were exuberant rather than normal. Also discussed was the issue of the relative roles of monetary policy and macro prudential tools. From a macro viewpoint, Shin argued, one could think of both as affecting the demand and the supply of credit. From a financial viewpoint, one could think of monetary policy as a general instrument, and macro prudential as specific instruments. During the discussion, Lars Svensson argued that a simple cost-benefit analysis suggests that monetary policy is a very poor instrument to deal with financial risk. In a [cost-benefit analysis of the Swedish case that uses Riksbank estimates, the unemployment cost of increasing the interest rate far exceeds the benefits of a potentially better future macro outcome from a potential reduction in the probability and severity of a financial crisis. I found his arguments convincing. **7\\. Should central banks keep their independence? ** Throughout the conference, e.g., in Gill Marcus' [talk, and actually throughout the various meetings which took place during the IMF meetings in the following days, policy makers remarked and complained about the heavy burden placed on monetary policy in this crisis, and the danger of a political backlash against central banks. Even as the crisis recedes, it is clear that central banks will end up with substantially more responsibilities'whether they are given in full or shared'for financial regulation, financial supervision, and the use of macro prudential tools. While even the use of the policy rate has distributional implications, these implications are much more salient in the case of regulation or macro prudential tools, such as the loan-to-value ratio. The general consensus was that these distributional implications could not be ignored, and that while central banks should retain full independence with respect to traditional monetary policy, this cannot be the case for regulation or macro prudential tools. **8\\. Little progress on the design of fiscal policy ** The traditional objection to using fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy tool was that recessions did not last long, and by the time discretionary fiscal measures were implemented, it was typically too late. Martin Feldstein made the point that some recessions, in particular those associated with financial crises, are long enough that discretionary policy can and should be used. He noted however that fiscal activism need not mean changes in the overall budget deficit or surplus, but may come from changes in the composition of the budget, for example, an increase in the investment tax credit financed by an increase in corporate taxation. Interestingly, despite questions by the chair of the [session, Vitor Gaspar, on potential improvements in the design of automatic stabilizers (based on the very interesting chapter 2 of the April 2015 [Fiscal Monitor), the issue did not register, and I am still struck by the lack of action on this front. The likely reason is that, for the time being, the focus on most governments is on debt reduction, on the right speed of fiscal consolidation. Even there however, there has been little work, and even less action on the design of fiscal rules. In that respect, an interesting remark by Marco Buti was that the excessive number and complexity of the European Union rules reflects in part the relative weakness of the European commission in making sure countries actually implement them. **9\\. The complex effects of capital flows** What struck me most in the discussion of [capital flows was the recognition that they have complex effects, a theme which resonated with the recent Mundell Fleming [lecture by Helene Rey. Globalization and the increase in countries' gross asset and liability positions, imply that shifts in flows can be very large. As all three speakers in the session, **Agust\u00c3\u00adn** Carstens, Maury Obstfeld, Luiz Pereira da Silva'as well as Raghuram Rajan in the final panel discussion, 'argued, the effects of these shifts go far beyond changes in exchange rates: they affect the domestic financial system, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worst. This conclusion has one clear implication, namely that hands-off policies are not the solution. I see this as one area where the rethinking has been striking, say compared to ten years ago. There was wide agreement that macro prudential tools can decrease the adverse effects on the banking system. There was also agreement that FX intervention can be a useful tool, at least to stabilize the exchange rate. Pereira da Silva argued for a pragmatic approach in Brazil centered on these. But there was no agreement on capital controls. Carstens was against, arguing that, at least for Mexico, which is highly integrated with the United States, capital controls have more costs than benefits and should be avoided. To me, capital controls are not fundamentally different from macro prudential tools; the rules for investors have to be clear, both ex ante and ex post. **10\\. How much can the international monetary system be improved?** Turning to the design of the [international monetary system, Ricardo Caballero touched upon the demand for safe assets by emerging market countries, and argued for a better provision of international liquidity by the IMF and by central banks. Not only would this be desirable on its own, but, relating it to the earlier discussion, it would also lead to an increase in the world safe real rate, and alleviate the worries about secular stagnation. Maury Obstfeld argued that no exchange rate arrangement was perfect, but that managed float was still probably the best arrangement for most countries. Two other main issues came up: The first was how to square the national mandate of central banks with the fact that monetary policies can have large spillover effects on other countries, potentially leading to a bad global outcome. Jaime Caruana argued for \"enlightened self interest,\" based on the notion that originating countries should, in their own interest, take into account the 'spillbacks'\u009d of their policies. This self interest argument however only goes so far: spillbacks may be limited, and taking them into account may still not induce behavior consistent with the best global outcome. The second issue was closely related, and had to do with the exact nature of the spillovers. Put in a more formal way, is the Nash equilibrium'the equilibrium which arises when each central bank tries to fulfill its national mandate given other central banks' actions'suboptimal relative to a cooperative equilibrium. Zeti Akhtar Aziz argued that these spillovers were poorly understood. Better understanding, she argued, could lead to less disagreements and frictions among advanced economies and emerging markets. **The bottom line**** ** Not all the questions I had raised in my preconference [blog were taken up, and few were settled. Still, to go back to the title of the conference, \"Rethinking Macro Policy III: Progress or Confusion?\" my answer is definitely 'both.'\u009d Progress is undeniable. Confusion is unavoidable, given the complex issues that remain to be settled. (My own intervention, on this theme, is available [here).

In our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ we show that the problem has now grown to more than '\u00ac900 billion. This stock of nonperforming loans is concentrated in the hardest hit economies, with two- thirds located in just six euro area economies. The European Central Bank's [Asset Quality Review confirmed this picture, which revealed that the majority of banks in many of these economies had high levels of nonperforming assets (see chart 1). [ In January, the European Central Bank announced its [expanded asset purchase program to address the risks of persistently low inflation. This has already delivered measurable signs of success: financing costs have fallen, equity prices are higher and the euro has depreciated, helping to support inflation expectations. But other policies must complement this central bank action'aimed at unclogging bank lending channels'to maximize the effectiveness of monetary policies. **Bad loans hinder lending**** ** Banks need to tackle their bad loans, which are a burden on bank balance sheets and a drag on credit. As the diagram below shows, they reduce profitability as banks have to set aside funds to cover the losses, they generate less interest income, and they have associated operational costs (such as administrative expenses and legal fees). [ Less profitable banks have lower retained earnings and so generate less capital for new lending. These loans (net of provisions) also use scarce balance sheet resources as banks need to fund them and they tend to have high risk weights for regulatory capital ratios'leaving less room to provide new loans. Banks with high levels of these loans may also be less willing to lend to borderline borrowers as they want to avoid future bad assets, leaving many banks chasing the same good-quality companies. At the same time, these loans are the flip-side of the [corporate sector debt overhang, which acts as a brake on lending growth from the demand side as highly indebted borrowers are less likely to want more credit. What should be done? Regulators should provide strong incentives for banks to maintain adequate provisioning to help reduce the gap between bank and market valuations for nonperforming loans. They should ensure that provisions reflect forward-looking expected credit losses and that banks use prudent approaches to collateral valuation, recovery rates and resolution time. Banks should also develop and use specialized capacity for handling these loans. Country officials should continue to review and reform legal frameworks for bankruptcy, where necessary. A second way to help unclog bank credit is for regulators to provide greater clarity about bank regulatory and supervisory standards. Banks are making lending decisions at a time when they are [adapting business models to new regulatory and economic realities. In this environment, banks are likely to be unwilling to lend more by running down buffers of capital or liquidity'in excess of regulatory minima'in the absence of clarity about medium-term regulatory requirements. If policymakers and bankers do not act to support bank lending, simulations in the [_Global Financial Stability Report_ suggest that credit growth could be limited to a meager 1-3 percent on average per year.

Ghosh, and [Mahvash S. Qureshi There has been a remarkable increase in financial flows to [frontier economies from private sources which, in relation to their economic size, are now on par with those to emerging economies (see chart). [ These large private flows can be volatile'responding strongly to changes in global conditions'as emerging economies' experience has shown, and generate financial-stability and macroeconomic risks. The anticipated rise in U.S. interest rates sometime this year is thus expected to create macroeconomic volatility for both emerging and frontier economies. How policymakers in frontier economies can navigate this uncharted territory of volatility and risks from capital flows, and what is the optimal pace and degree of financial liberalization that they should pursue to meet their developmental objectives are pressing policy questions confronting many of these countries. To debate the issues and policies, and benefit from peer-to-peer learning, the [IMF recently brought together experts from both emerging and frontier economies. Here are some key insights that emerged from the discussions:** ** * **No one-size-fits-all**. Frontier economies have not taken a 'one-size-fits-all'\u009d approach toward the pace and extent of capital account liberalization. Some countries, like [Bangladesh, have adopted a more cautious stance. They allow flows into the tradable sector, regulate foreign investors' access to the financial sector, and have so far refrained from issuing sovereign bonds in international markets. By contrast, other countries like [Uganda and [Zambia have largely open financial accounts, and increasingly face macroeconomic challenges'notably exchange rate overshooting'from volatile portfolio flows that appear to overwhelm their domestic financial markets. The pace of liberalization has slowed down in some countries like [Ghana, after large capital inflows induced fiscal excesses and volatility in the exchange rate. * **'Pragmatic'\u009d approach to liberalization**. The optimal degree of capital account liberalization for frontier economies'which are relatively less financially and institutionally developed'is open to question. Developing countries are said to benefit from liberalization as they are saving-constrained, and foreign saving helps them to finance worthy investments, which accelerates economic growth. [Dani Rodrik, however, argued that in practice many frontier economies are more likely to be investment-constrained rather than saving-constrained. If liberalization encourages inflows that strengthen the currency, investments in crucial tradable-goods industries will suffer, thus undercutting the growth potential of liberalizing economies. This, in his view, calls for the adoption of _structural_ capital controls, and a 'pragmatic'\u009d approach to financial integration. More generally, [Olivier Jeanne noted that there may be a tension between the level of the exchange rate desirable for economic growth and the one actually produced by financial markets when the economy opens to foreign flows. Countries such as China, which have recorded impressive growth performance, and graduated from the frontier to emerging economy status in the last twenty years, have done so without fully opening up their capital accounts. * **Institutional challenges to managing flows**. Institutional weaknesses in some frontier economies complicate management of large capital inflows. These include a lack of central bank independence, public debt sustainability concerns (in some frontier economies, much of the flows represent foreign borrowing by governments), and weak financial supervision and regulation. This raises the question of whether frontier economies with largely or fully open capital accounts could potentially benefit from some rolling back of liberalization in the form of additional regulation of more fickle types of capital flows. * **Lessons from emerging economies**. Learning from the experience of emerging economies, policymakers need to manage volatile capital flows by deploying a host of tools, including monetary policy geared to meeting the inflation target; foreign exchange intervention (in the face of currency appreciation pressures and to the extent that costs of sterilization are manageable and the credibility of monetary policy framework is not jeopardized); and prudential measures or capital controls, as appropriate. The [IMF has recognized the role for capital controls to mitigate financial-stability risks. Views differed, however, on the right combination of these policy tools, with some such as [Jos\u00c3\u00a9 de Gregorio remaining skeptical of the use of capital controls and foreign exchange intervention, and arguing that the first line of defense for macroeconomic and financial stability is sound macroeconomic policies (inflation targeting; fiscal prudence; greater exchange rate flexibility), and prudential measures. * **Capital controls vs. macroprudential measures**. While [recent studies point to the effectiveness of capital controls and prudential measures in mitigating financial-stability risks, more research is warranted to evaluate their effectiveness in different contexts, such as in more versus less financially developed systems; for inflow versus outflow shocks; or for different types of capital flows'direct investment, portfolio equity, portfolio debt, or banking flows. As a practical matter, Dani Rodrik suggested that an [inventory of capital controls and prudential measures should be created to fit different circumstances'the measures should be monitored, evaluated, and revised as needed. So where do we go from here? The discussions at the conference highlighted that while progress has been made in recent years in thinking about the liberalization and management of capital flows, many questions remain subject to debate. Is more liberalization always desirable, or might it frustrate other economic goals, including income convergence with high-income countries? Does full liberalization expose FMs to a greater risk of destabilizing shocks that are difficult to manage in practice, and outweigh the benefits of financial integration, or can such risks be offset by more vigorous deployment of different policy tools? What is the role, right combination, and possible effectiveness of the different policy tools'including foreign exchange intervention and capital controls'to manage capital flow volatility? Clearly, we need more research and debate to explore these issues. The conference was a step in the right direction. We have much to gain from peer- to-peer discussions, and the exchange of information on policy options among policymakers, as well as from debating these issues more broadly with academics and financial sector experts.

A longer-term look at trends yields a different picture, however. Over the past year, U.S. job creation has been impressive. Payroll gains have averaged 260,000 per month'well above the 160,000 monthly average seen throughout the 2010'13 recovery. As a result, the unemployment rate has plummeted to 5.5 percent in March 2015 (see Chart 1). And this level is just above many estimates of the current 'natural'\u009d level of unemployment'the rate of unemployment that would prevail once cyclical factors have played themselves out and the economy is growing at trend. Some argue that a negligible difference between the unemployment rate and the natural rate'the so-called unemployment gap'is equivalent to full employment. [ So, is the U.S. approaching full employment? It's close. The answer to this question has crucial policy implications. How close the U.S. economy is to full employment will guide the Fed's decision on when and how fast to increase interest rates. And as the 'taper tantrum'\u009d of 2013 illustrated all too well, changing perceptions of Fed policy have major implications for the global economy and financial markets. In this blog, we argue that notwithstanding signs of improvement in the labor market, slack remains. This points to a still important role for accommodative macroeconomic policies. And we shouldn't forget about policies to expand the quantity, and improve the quality, of the labor supply. **More slack than meets the eye** While a shrinking unemployment gap suggests that we are approaching full employment, the employment-to-population ratio paints a different picture (Chart 2). Indeed, this ratio, which measures how many of those able to work are actually employed, is still more than 4 percentage points below its level on the eve of the Great Recession. [ What could cause such a disconnect? Well, to begin, there are workers who want and are available for work but did not search for jobs in the last 4 weeks and hence were not classified as unemployed (these are the so-called 'marginally attached'\u009d workers). Moreover, there are still numerous part-time workers that would like to work more hours but cannot as businesses continue to face difficult conditions. Adding these components to the unemployment rate suggests that some labor market slack remains (Chart 3). [ As Fed Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized, a fuller picture of the labor market requires looking at other factors beyond the unemployment rate. These include gauges of labor market dynamism such as job openings, hires, and quits, which have recovered to precrisis levels (Chart 4). The growing number of quits is particularly encouraging as it signals that people are more confident to leave their current job in pursuit of higher-paying, better-fitting opportunities. [ **A comprehensive measure of slack**** ** To recap, by some important measures (like the unemployment rate), the labor market has made a phenomenal comeback from the depths of the Great Recession. Yet, there remain key areas where the crisis legacies are being slowly worked through (such as the outsized ranks of the involuntary part-timers or the current labor force participation rate that is below its trend). To bring all these elements into a single measure of slack, our [recent study computes a broadly defined 'employment gap'\u009d that includes deviations of unemployment and participation rates from their trend or natural levels, and adjusts for the large number of involuntary part-time workers. As one would expect, our measure shows the emergence of a substantial employment gap in the aftermath of the Great Recession, largely driven by bulging unemployment and part-time gaps. The participation gap, in turn, started to grow from 2010 onwards, as the prolonged recession led many to become discouraged and abandon the work force (Chart 5). It is this legacy that the labor market has been working through. Today, with an unemployment rate that has fallen to well within 1 percentage point of most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, the remaining slack stems mainly from the participation gap, and to a lesser extent from the part-time gap. **Looking ahead, we expect that overall labor market slack will disappear by 2018.** [ However, some uncertainty surrounds the underlying structural components of our estimate. Different assumptions could extend the date of full labor market recovery by up to one year. For instance, a lower natural rate of unemployment, a higher participation rate trend, or a lingering part-time gap would push the closing of the gap to 2019. **How to reduce the slack** Our measure of the employment gap suggests that labor market slack remains and will only decline gradually, pointing to a still important role for accommodative macroeconomic policies to help reach full employment. In addition, given the continued decline of the participation rate, policies to expand the labor supply are vital to boost potential growth in the medium term. Key measures range from enhancing job search and training programs'to raise human capital and productivity 'to targeting benefits for low-income families (for example, childcare support). Finally, immigration reform ought to be part of the solution. To counter the effects of an aging population, the United States should augment its visa program for high-skilled immigrants. This would not only enhance the size and productivity of the workforce, but also help shore up the government's fiscal position.

Differing economic performance in major advanced countries has led to divergent monetary policies. Both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have started significant expansions of their balance sheets, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has ended its bond-buying program and is expected to start raising rates. This has had many effects, in particular, contributing to a sharp depreciation of the Yen and the Euro against the U.S. dollar (see chart 1). [ The policy actions by the major advanced economies, among other factors, have also had diverse effects within Asia (excluding Japan). In this chart-based blog, we consider three key issues: the impact on the region of monetary policy divergence among major advanced economies, potential tensions this may pose, and possible policy responses. **Impact on the region** Recent actions by the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank would tend to create capital inflows into Asia (excluding Japan) and appreciation pressure, but prospective action by the Fed would tend to create the opposite. * Most countries in the region have experienced capital _out_flows rather than _in_flows in recent months. The main exception is India, which has received substantial inflows. * Most currencies in the region have appreciated in real effective exchange rate (REER) terms (i.e., against a weighted average of their trade partners' currencies after adjusting for inflation), but depreciated against the U.S. dollar. [ Chart 2 shows three groups: * **China/Hong Kong SAR/India/Indonesia/Philippines/Thailand**'large REER appreciation and little depreciation versus the U.S. dollar. The increase for China (15%) has been particularly sharp, reflecting its link to the U.S. dollar, and follows on from a trend 5% annual appreciation for the last 10 years. (Indonesia's REER appreciation is inflated by the recent reduction in fuel subsidies). * **Korea/Singapore**'little REER change and some depreciation versus the U.S. dollar. * **Australia/New Zealand/Malaysia**'large depreciation versus the U.S. dollar and, for Australia and Malaysia, significant REER depreciation. Countries with external positions stronger than implied by fundamentals have, as one would expect, tended to see their REERs appreciate (e.g., China), and vice versa (e.g., Australia). However, **Group 2** countries (Korea, Singapore) and Malaysia have seen little or no REER appreciation despite strong external positions and some **Group 1** countries (Indonesia, India, Hong Kong SAR, Thailand) have seen significant REER appreciation despite having balanced, or indeed, weaker, external positions. [ However, these REER movements should be seen in the context of other global developments since June (see charts 3 and 4). In particular, as a result of the sharp fall in the price of oil and most other commodities, many countries' trade balances have risen. But others, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, but also Australia and New Zealand, have lost significant export revenue from lower commodity prices (helping explain why, for example, Malaysia's currency has depreciated). [ The fall in commodity prices together with REER appreciations across most economies, is also pushing down inflation (see chart 5). In many countries, inflation is now at very low levels (China, Korea, New Zealand), or even negative (Thailand, Singapore). Core inflation has tended to move less, but generally in the same direction. [ **The potential tensions** The main tensions that may emerge from policy actions by advanced economies, especially in some of the largest economies, relate to weakening exports and financial instability. * **Weakening exports.** We expect export volume growth to hold up across the region overall. However, stronger currencies could weaken external demand, which in turn could lower overall economic growth and exacerbate internal imbalances. Indeed, only for Australia and the Philippines do the recent REER movements go in the direction of reducing internal imbalances (as measured by the output gap' the difference between what an economy is capable of producing without sparking inflation and what it is actually producing). In contrast, output in Thailand, China, and Hong Kong SAR is projected to remain well below potential, which the strong REER appreciation will tend to exacerbate (see chart 6). [ * **Financial instability.** Risks vary greatly across the region. For example, many corporates have borrowed in U.S. dollars (e.g., Indonesia), and the stronger U.S. dollar will make debt service more costly. India's large capital inflows could lead to significant financial volatility in the event they reverse (as during the 2013 'taper tantrum'\u009d). Looking forward, if countries were to significantly loosen monetary policy to offset the contractionary impact of stronger currencies, this could foster excessive credit growth. **Need for flexible monetary policy response** Many countries have responded to these developments above by cutting interest rates (see chart 7). Several countries have also taken other measures, for example, India accumulated international reserves to strengthen buffers ahead of potential increased global financial volatility. [ Going forward, especially if exchange rate and capital flow pressures continue, monetary policy should generally continue to respond flexibly, with macro-prudential policy the first line of defense for addressing financial stability concerns. The specific response should of course depend on individual country circumstances.

It also turns out that one way to finance infrastructure is through [Islamic finance, since'similar to public-private partnerships'investors finance the construction of roads, bridges, and similar projects, and receive the returns on these investments until the project reaches maturity. While Islamic finance is growing rapidly in Muslim countries, it is also attracting attention in other places.

Apart from a short-lived recession during the global financial crisis, this would be the slowest rate of growth since 2002. However, growth dynamics vary across the region, broadly along North-South lines. While spring may be in the air for Mexico, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean, the economic climate remains decidedly chilly in much of South America. What is behind these divergent prospects, and how can a sunnier outlook be restored to the entire region? [ **Signs of spring up North'\u00a6**** ** Two external factors play a key role in shaping the region's outlook: * The solid recovery in the U.S. economy, where growth is projected to reach 3 percent in 2015. * The persistent weakness of global commodity markets, including the [collapse in oil prices since mid-2014. For most economies in **Central America and the Caribbean**, both of these developments are good news. Linked to the U.S. economy through trade, remittance, and tourism flows, they will benefit from buoyant activity in the United States, even if it entails a gradual rise in U.S. interest rates. At the same time, cheaper oil is creating significant relief, cutting import bills by 3-4 percentage points of GDP on average. The pick-up in growth would be stronger if it were not for long-standing domestic problems that continue to weigh on activity'notably, weak fiscal positions in many countries and significant competitiveness challenges in the tourism-dependent Caribbean. A better external environment provides a good opportunity to address these problems. Mexico's economy, in turn, is projected to pick up pace, supported by stronger U.S. demand. Lower oil prices create some revenue losses for the government, but since oil production no longer accounts for a large share of activity, the headwinds to growth should be limited. [ **'\u00a6but chills continue down South** For **South America**, by contrast, recent external developments have been mostly unfavorable. Trade linkages with the U.S. economy are relatively modest, limiting positive spillovers. Meanwhile, the continued decline in commodity prices has hit the region's heavyweight commodity exporters. The most affected in recent months have been economies with significant oil and gas exports, notably Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, whose terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) have plunged. Country-specific challenges, including very weak private sector confidence in Brazil and the intensifying economic crisis in Venezuela, further weigh on their outlook. In this environment, growth is projected to slow further in most of South America, as weakness in corporate investment spreads to consumer spending. Three of the largest economies (Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela) are expected to see contractions in 2015. On the upside, growth should rebound in Chile and Peru, helped by supportive fiscal and monetary policies that reflect strong macroeconomic frameworks and buffers built up during good times. Elsewhere, prospects depend on the nature of the external shock that economies are facing'Uruguay, for instance, has recently seen its terms of trade improve, as gains from cheaper oil imports outweigh losses from lower agricultural export prices'and their capacity to adjust. Flexible exchange rates can play an important role in facilitating the adjustment, by shifting demand toward locally produced goods. Colombia is a case in point, as the marked depreciation of the peso is expected to boost demand for its (noncommodity) exports.** ** [ **No quick fix to raise the temperature**** ** Even as South America grapples with low growth, unemployment remains at historically low levels in most of the large economies. Inflation is above midpoint targets, while current account deficits have generally widened further. Together, these facts suggest that economic slack still remains limited. With forecasts for growth over the medium term also revised down further, it seems clear that the region is facing more than just a temporary cyclical slowdown. Moreover, structurally weaker growth prospects coincide with a significant loss of policy space, as fiscal buffers have eroded in many countries, while depreciating exchange rates reduce the scope for further monetary easing.** ** **How to bring back sunnier times** Thus, caution is warranted against trying to turn up the heat with excessive macroeconomic policy stimulus. Restoring solid growth prospects will, instead, require a clear focus on addressing structural weaknesses'in infrastructure, education, governance, and the business environment. Policymakers across Latin America will also need to keep a close eye on financial sector risks. After several years of strong credit growth, capital inflows, and increasing issuance of corporate bonds in international markets, firms and households in many countries are now facing a tighter financing environment at the same time as corporate earnings and employment have started to weaken. Moreover, faster-than-anticipated normalization of U.S. monetary policy or other global shocks could prompt fresh turbulence in financial markets, while the marked appreciation of the dollar might hurt borrowers with unhedged dollar debt. Overall, sound balance sheets and credible policy commitments provide the best insurance against financial disruptions. Central banks, in particular, should maintain a clear focus on keeping inflation on target, while standing ready to forestall excessive exchange rate volatility or disorderly market dynamics with targeted interventions. In short, policymakers across Latin America and the Caribbean have their work cut out. With vigilance to financial risks, a firm commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies, and determined progress in structural reforms, the long stretch of chilly weather will eventually give way to warmer temperatures throughout the region again.

Oil prices have fallen about 45 percent since September (see April 2015 [_World Economic Outlook_), putting a big dent in the revenues of oil exporters, while providing oil importers an unexpected windfall. How has the decline in oil prices affected the public finances, and how should oil importers and exporters adjust to this new state of affairs? In the April 2015 [_Fiscal Monitor_, we argue that the oil price decline provides a golden opportunity to initiate serious energy subsidy and taxation reforms that would lock in savings, improve the public finances and boost long-term economic growth. **A sword that cuts both ways** For oil exporters, the decline in prices is expected to cut their revenues by an average of 4 percent of GDP in 2015. This is reflected in the large deterioration in the fiscal balances of exporters we now predict for 2015 (see chart 1). At the same time, oil importers are benefiting, but with significant variation across regions (see chart 2). [ [ The fiscal effects for importers depend on whether they regulate domestic energy prices. If they do and leave domestic prices unchanged, for example, the amount governments need to pay for energy subsidies goes down, as governments get to keep the windfall. For a typical oil importing country, we expect that about one-third of the decline in oil prices will be passed on to consumers, and two-thirds will go to governments. The fiscal savings under this scenario are expected to be about 1 percent of GDP in 2015.** ** **Oil exporters: dulling the edge of the sword** Oil exporters whose governments have amassed significant financial assets (net of public debt), including the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Norway, can use them to mitigate the short term impact of the shock. Others are allowing their currencies to weaken and will be able to partially offset lower oil revenues in foreign currency terms. Given the size of the shock, most will have to cut government spending to achieve a sustainable fiscal position. Given the possibility of a prolonged period of lower oil prices, a shift in focus to long-term reforms is advisable. This will require efforts to boost the non-oil revenue base; improve natural resource management; and improve the efficiency of government spending. In addition, stronger fiscal frameworks are needed to help countries cope with the ups and downs of commodity prices and revenues. This is an important challenge, and the October 2015 [_Fiscal Monitor_ will be exploring this theme in more detail. ** ** **Seize the moment** Both oil importers and exporters have an historic opportunity to take advantage of the decline in oil prices to start the process of reforming energy subsidies and taxation. Getting energy prices right would help rationalize energy consumption and reduce its adverse effects on the environment. In emerging market and developing economies, further reform of energy subsidies and taxation could provide space for growth-enhancing spending in education, health, and infrastructure, as well as programs for the poor. In advanced economies, taxes on labor could be cut, and paid for with higher energy taxes. Many countries are already taking bold steps in this direction. More than 20 countries have recently taken steps to decrease or eliminate energy subsidies, including Angola, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Many of these countries have followed the best practices discussed in [_Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications_'to communicate the reform plan to the public, explain its benefits, and set up mitigating measures for the poor. These are examples to follow. Low inflation and low oil prices create a favorable environment for the success of ambitious energy subsidy and energy taxation reform. Now is the time!

Can fiscal policy promote macroeconomic stability? Does greater stability support stronger growth? The answer is yes on all counts. This finding, while seemingly obvious, is now backed by numbers to match each question. The April 2015 [_Fiscal Monitor_ explores how. **A novel approach** To measure whether fiscal policy contributes to stability, the _Fiscal Monitor_ introduces the novel concept of the fiscal stabilization coefficient (FISCO). FISCO measures how much a country's overall budget balance changes in response to a change in economic slack (as measured by the output gap). If FISCO is equal to 1 it means that when output falls below potential by 1% of GDP, the overall balance worsens by the same percentage of GDP. The higher the FISCO, the more counter-cyclical is the conduct of fiscal policy, where governments build fiscal buffers in good times that they can then rely on during bad times. The average FISCO among advanced economies is 0.7, with considerable cross-country differences (see figure 1). For the FISCO for individual countries (including advanced, emerging market and developing countries) see Xavier Debrun's blog '[_Growth Dividend from Stabilizing Fiscal Policies_'\u009d. The FISCO takes into account the fact that many revenue and expenditure items respond to the state of the economy even though the underlying provisions or programs were primarily designed for other reasons. Monitoring the relationship between the budget balance and the output gap would help policymakers understand how much their action contributes to output stability, including in comparison to other countries. [ **Growth dividends** With the FISCO, the April 2015 _Fiscal Monitor_ assesses the effect that fiscal policy can have on medium-term growth through its support to macroeconomic stability. The findings suggest that countries that can increase their FISCO would be able to significantly reduce macroeconomic volatility (see figure 2). [ Why is this important? First, because lower macroeconomic volatility helps avoid wasteful fluctuations in employment and growth. Second, because lower macroeconomic uncertainty provides a favorable environment for physical and social capital, thereby boosting medium-term growth. Our results show that making fiscal policy more stabilizing would provide a significant boost to growth, as illustrated in figure 3. The effect can be large. Take, for example, the case of an advanced economy that raises its FISCO from the average level (0.7) to that in the top third of countries (about 0.8). This would reduce output volatility by about 15 percent, which in turn brings about a growth dividend of 0.3 percentage points annually. The [_Fiscal Monitor_ provides greater details of the methodology underlying this estimate, which attempts to address some of the well-known challenges with growth regressions identified in economic literature. Still, as with all econometric findings, these results must be interpreted with caution. [ **What this means for countries in practice** What can countries do to improve fiscal stabilization? In an earlier blog (written with Richard Hughes and Laura Jaramillo, [_Dams and Dikes for Public Finances_) we argue that it is crucial to have in place a fiscal framework to manage public finance risks. Well-designed fiscal rules and medium-term frameworks can also help by enabling uninterrupted access to borrowing at favorable conditions, ensuring expenditure control over the entire cycle, and leaving flexibility to respond to output shocks. Another important aspect of fiscal frameworks is to induce rules-like, automatic stabilizing responses to economic developments. For example, tax payments that move in sync with income, and social transfers, such as unemployment benefits can automatically boost aggregate demand during downturns and moderate it during upswings. Because they operate in real time, without political approval or implementation lags, they are a very effective way to make fiscal policy stabilizing. Read the April 2015 [_Fiscal Monitor_ for more insights into these and other options to promote macroeconomic stability and thereby boost growth.

Risks to the global financial system have risen since October and have rotated to parts of the financial system where they are harder to assess and harder to address. 2. Advanced economies need to enhance the traction of monetary policies to achieve their goals, while managing undesirable financial side effects of low interest rates. 3. To withstand the global crosscurrents of lower oil prices, rising U.S. policy rates, and a stronger dollar, emerging markets must increase the resilience of their financial systems by addressing domestic vulnerabilities. Let me now discuss these findings in detail.** ** **Financial stability risks have risen amid a moderate and uneven global economic recovery'with rates of inflation that are too low in many countries. **Divergent growth and monetary policies have increased tensions in global financial markets and caused rapid and volatile moves in exchange rates and interest rates over the past six months. In part, this situation results from the legacy of weakened and incomplete repair of private sector balance sheets. Risks are also rotating'away from banks to shadow banks, from solvency to market liquidity risks, and from advanced economies to emerging markets.** ** In light of this, five key challenges must be met to safeguard global financial stability. **The first is to enhance ****the traction of monetary policies****.**** ** **The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have pursued bold monetary policies to counter renewed disinflationary pressures. **These quantitative easing programs have already shown measurable signs of success: financing costs have fallen in the euro area, equity prices have surged, and the euro and yen have depreciated significantly, helping support inflation expectations. However, **central bank actions must be complemented with other policies**; otherwise monetary policies cannot be fully effective in achieving their aims. What is needed is 'QE plus other policies.' * In the** euro area, **it is necessary to tackle nonperforming loans to further unclog bank lending channels. And why is this important? Because banks burdened with bad loans lend less. Nonperforming loans now stand at more than 900 billion euros, despite important achievements in strengthening bank capital in the wake of the ECB's Comprehensive Assessment and the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Policymakers should encourage banks to deal with this stock of bad loans and implement more efficient legal and institutional frameworks to speed up this process. * In **Japan,** the effectiveness of QE depends on the policies supporting it. Steadfast implementation of Abenomics' second and third arrows'namely fiscal and structural reforms'is essential. If these reforms are incomplete, efforts to keep the economy out of deflation and raise growth are less likely to succeed. * In the **United States**, the baseline of a smooth monetary policy normalization is not guaranteed. Divergences between market participants and policymakers over the expected pace of U.S. monetary tightening suggest that markets are taking a more benign view of inflation prospects. But low long-term yields also suggest the potential for upside surprises in long rates, when policy tightening becomes more imminent. Smooth normalization of monetary policy will continue to require the Fed getting the pace of 'exit'\u009d right and clearly communicating to the public. A rapid decompression of yields could increase volatility with global repercussions.** ** **The second challenge is to limit the financial excesses resulting from accommodative monetary policies, and to manage the negative financial impact of a prolonged period of low interest rates. **For instance, weak European mid-sized life insurers could face rising risks of distress, with almost a quarter of insurers unable to meet their solvency capital requirements if low interest rates were to persist. With a portfolio of '\u00ac4.4 trillion in assets in the European Union in the hands of life insurers, and high and rising interconnectedness with the wider financial system, weak insurers create a source of potential spillovers. This is an important illustration of the rotation of risks from banks to nonbanks.** ** **The third challenge is to preserve stability in emerging markets caught in global cross-currents and confronting domestic vulnerabilities. **Lower commodity prices and lower inflationary pressures are benefiting many emerging economies, providing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. However, oil- and commodity-exporters and market sectors that have borrowed heavily face more substantial risks. Strains in the debt repayment capacity of the energy sector may become more evident in Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, and South Africa, as well as in countries reliant on oil revenues, such as Nigeria and Venezuela. The sharp dollar appreciation entails additional risks for corporates and countries with large foreign currency debts. **In China, retrenchment from overinvested industries, coupled with property price declines, could spill over to emerging markets more broadly.** Exposures to real estate are almost 20 percent of domestic lending in China. Financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spillovers, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. The overall priority must be to allow an **orderly correction of excesses**, curtailing the riskiest parts of shadow banking. Smooth deleveraging also requires mechanisms for effective corporate debt restructuring and the exit of nonviable firms. **Across emerging markets more generally, financial resilience can be enhanced through** micro- and macroprudential measures. Regulators need to conduct bank stress tests related to foreign currency and commodity price risks, and more closely and regularly monitor corporate leverage and unhedged foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions.** ** **The fourth challenge is to cope with geopolitical tensions **in Russia and Ukraine, the Middle East, and parts of Africa, as well as risks in Greece. **Managing any of these challenges could become more difficult when markets are illiquid. **Markets may have sufficient liquidity in good times, but this can dry up rapidly when markets are strained, amplifying the impact of shocks on prices. During periods of illiquidity since the crisis, correlation across markets has risen, increasing the potential for contagion. The underlying causes include a shift towards high-frequency electronic trading, reduced market making, and greater use of benchmarks. **Additional policy measures'beyond monetary policies'are vital to make a durable exit from the global financial crisis and to safeguard financial stability.** Crisis legacies need to be addressed. The traction of monetary policies must be increased with complementary reforms and financial excesses need to be contained. Market liquidity needs to be strengthened and financial regulatory reforms must be completed.

This global number reflects an increase in growth in advanced economies, 2.4% versus 1.8%, offset by a decrease in growth in emerging market and developing economies, 4.3% versus 4.6% last year. In short, to repeat the words used by the IMF Managing Director [last week, we see growth as 'moderate and uneven'\u009d. Behind these [numbers lies an unusually complex set of forces shaping the world economy. Some, such as the decline in the price of oil and the evolution of exchange rates, are highly visible. Some, from crisis legacies to lower potential growth, play more of a role behind the scene but are important nevertheless. Let me briefly review them. **Legacies **from both the financial and the euro crises are still visible in many advanced economies. To varying degrees, weak banks and high levels of debt'public, corporate, or household'still weigh on spending and growth. Low growth, in turn, makes deleveraging a slow process. There is a clear lesson here: Deleveraging will take time. **[**[**Potential growth** has declined. Potential growth in advanced economies was already declining before the crisis. Aging, together with a slowdown in total productivity, were at work. The crisis made it worse, with the large decrease in investment leading to even lower capital growth. Capital growth will recover, but aging and weak productivity growth will continue to limit growth. The decrease is more pronounced in emerging markets, where aging, lower capital accumulation and lower productivity growth are combining to significantly lower potential growth in the future. It would be wrong to speak, as some have done, of stagnation, but prospects are more subdued. And more subdued prospects lead, in turn, to lower spending and lower growth today. The **decline in the price of oil** has led to a large reallocation of real income from oil exporters to oil importers. The early evidence suggests that, in oil importers, from the United States, to the euro area, to China, and to India, the increase in real income is increasing spending. Oil exporters have cut spending but to a smaller extent: many have substantial financial reserves and are in a position to reduce spending slowly. **Exchange rate movements** have been unusually large. Among major currencies, the dollar has seen a major appreciation, and the euro and the yen a major depreciation. These movements clearly reflect differences in monetary policy, with the United States expecting to exit the zero lower bound this year, but with no such prospects for the euro area or Japan. To the extent that both the euro area and Japan were at risk of another relapse, the euro and yen depreciations will help. To some extent, the United States has the policy room to offset the adverse effects of the dollar appreciation. Thus, this adjustment of exchange rates must be seen, on net, as good news for the world economy. Now, put all these forces together. Some countries suffer from adverse legacies, others do not. Some countries suffer from lower potential growth, others do not. Some countries gain from the decrease in the price of oil, others lose. Some countries' currencies move with the dollar, others move with the euro and the yen. Add to this a couple of idiosyncratic developments, such as the economic trouble in Russia, or the weakness of Brazil. On net, as I have indicated, our baseline forecasts are for an increase in growth in advanced economies, and for a decrease in growth in emerging markets and developing economies. But these overall numbers do not do full justice to the diversity of underlying evolutions. **As always, there are risks to the forecasts.** We see macroeconomic risks as having slightly decreased. The major risk last year'namely, a recession in the Euro area'has decreased, and so has the risk of deflation. But financial and geopolitical risks have increased. Large movements in relative prices, whether exchange rates or the price of oil, creates losers and winners. Energy companies and oil-producing countries face both tougher conditions and higher risks. If large exchange rate movements were to continue, they could both create further financial risks and ignite international tensions. A Greek crisis cannot be ruled out, an event that could unsettle financial markets. Turmoil continues in Ukraine and in the Middle East, although so far without systemic economic implications. **Turning finally to policy recommendations**. Given the diversity of situations, it is obvious that policy advice must be country-specific. Even so, some general principles continue to hold. Measures to sustain growth both in the short and the longer term continue to be of the essence. With the introduction of quantitative easing in the euro area, monetary policy in advanced economies has largely accomplished what it can. On the fiscal side, the decrease in the price of oil has created an opportunity to decrease energy subsidies and replace them with better-targeted programs. The case for more [infrastructure investment we made in the previous World Economic Outlook remains. And while structural reforms cannot do miracles, they can increase the level of output and increase growth for some time. The proper menu differs by country. Given the short-term political costs associated with many of these reforms, the challenge remains to choose carefully, and to implement them.

Yet the simple mirror image of stability, growth, and balanced budgets currently seems odd to many. And with monetary policy looking breathless, some even wonder whether sacrificing fiscal sanity for short-term growth might not be worth a try. In any economic debate, looking at the data is always a good starting point. And the latest issue of the [_Fiscal Monitor_ does exactly that. Our study looks at the experience with fiscal stabilization during the past three decades in a broad sample of 85 advanced, emerging market, and developing economies. The message is loud and clear: governments can use fiscal policy to smooth fluctuations in economic activity, and this can lead to higher medium-term growth. This essentially means governments need to save in good times so that they can use the budget to stabilize output in bad times. In advanced economies, making fiscal policies more stabilizing could cut output volatility by about 15 percent, with a growth dividend of about 0.3 percentage point annually. Of course, using the budget to stabilize output requires healthy public accounts that can take hard hits during severe storms. And when the sunshine returns, policymakers must be wise enough to repair public accounts in preparation for future storms. That's how stability, growth, and sustainability go hand in hand. **How does fiscal policy stabilize output? ** Fiscal policy has a stabilizing effect on an economy if the budget balance'the difference between expenditure and revenue'increases when output rises and decreases when it falls. For instance, if output suddenly contracts, policymakers can let tax revenues fall along with income (or even deliberately cut tax rates) and let unemployment benefits increase with the number of unemployed. This maintains income and purchasing power for individuals, and supports demand. Policymakers can also raise demand directly by deliberately spending more. Either way, higher deficit (or a lower surplus) effectively cushions the blow on output. The response of the government budget balance to economic activity is clearly the key to understanding the contribution of fiscal policy to output stability. To gauge overall fiscal stabilization, our study measured the impact of what a one percentage-point change in output can have on the budget balance (in percent of GDP). For example, a coefficient equal to 1 means that the fiscal response is exactly of the same size as the initial shock. Chart 1 shows that these so-called 'fiscal stabilization coefficients'\u009d can be quite sizable, especially in advanced economies. However, in emerging markets and developing economies fiscal stabilization is generally more modest and less frequent, though there are some that have large coefficients. [ The overall reduction in output volatility due to fiscal stabilization is evident from simple cross-country correlations between volatility and the stabilization coefficients (see chart 2), which are clearly negative. The analysis in the _Fiscal Monitor_ also suggests that a more stable macroeconomic environment created by fiscal stabilization has positive effects on medium-term growth. One plausible explanation is that less uncertainty tends to encourage investment in all its forms (physical, human, and social). [ **Adapting fiscal policy** Continuously adapting fiscal policy to output variations looks impossible to do in practice. It would seem to require definite responses to a long list of 'How To'\u009d questions: How to gauge the state of the economy in real time? How to design the appropriate policy response? How to ensure political approval? How to implement it in a timely manner? In fact, it is not so complicated, thanks to automatic stabilizers which comprise tax payments that move in sync with income and spending, and social transfers, such as unemployment benefits which automatically boost aggregate demand during downturns and moderate them during upswings. It is because they operate in real time, without decision or implementation lags, that they are a very effective way to make fiscal policy stabilizing. Yet fiscal actions often end up undermining automatic stabilizers. A widespread tendency to spend the revenue windfalls during good times is the main culprit. This is not just bad for output stability; it is also bad for public debt. The figure below is striking. The simulations first describe a stable public debt path over time. It reflects 'symmetric stabilization'\u009d because deficit reductions in good times fully offset deficit increases in bad times. Debt can also go on an upward path by spending just half of the revenue increases (due to above average growth) while letting deficits fully absorb the impact of downturn. [ **Steady as she grows** The policy implications are clear. Stability, growth and debt sustainability could all greatly benefit if measures that destabilizes output, such as spending increases in good times, were avoided. That's the kind of policies a well-designed fiscal framework can encourage (see the recent blog by Vitor Gaspar, Richard Hughes and Laura Jaramillo on [Dams and Dikes for Public Finances). Countries could also augment automatic stabilizers but this should not be done through undue increases in taxes and transfer programs, which can have undesirable side effects on growth and employment. The Fiscal Monitor discusses options to boost stabilizers while avoiding these caveats. A good starting point would be preventing certain tax deductions from increasing during booms and decreasing during recessions.

In advanced economies, business investment'the largest component of private investment'has contracted much more since the global financial crisis than after previous recession. And there are worrying signs that this has eroded long-term economic growth. Getting the diagnosis right is critical for devising policies to encourage firms to invest more. If low investment is merely a symptom of a weak economic environment, with firms responding to weak sales, then calls for expanding overall economic activity could be justified. If, on the other hand, special impediments are mainly to blame, such as policy uncertainty or financial sector weaknesses, as some suggest, then these must be removed before investment can rise. **Weak economic activity key factor** [Our research, in [Chapter 4 of the April 2015 _World Economic Outlook_, suggests that weak economic activity is the overriding factor holding back business investment. Although it contracted more severely following the crisis than in previous recessions, the contraction in output was also much more severe. The joint behavior of business investment and output has therefore not been unusual (see chart 1). Using a novel statistical approach that deals with reverse causality running from investment to output, we confirm that business investment has deviated little from what could be expected given the weakness in economic activity (see chart 2). In other words, firms have reacted to weak sales'both current and prospective'by reducing capital spending. Indeed, when businesses are asked about the main challenges facing them, they typically report lack of customer demand as the dominant factor. Beyond this general pattern, we find pockets of puzzling investment weakness, particularly in euro area countries whose borrowing costs spiked during the 2010-11 sovereign debt crisis. In these countries, financial constraints and policy uncertainty have played an additional role, beyond weak output, in holding back business investment. **[Reviving private investment**** ** We conclude that a comprehensive policy effort to expand output is needed to sustainably raise private investment. Fiscal and monetary policies can encourage firms to invest, although such policies are unlikely to return investment fully to precrisis trends. More [public infrastructure investment could also spur demand in the short term, raise supply in the medium term, and thus 'crowd in'\u009d private investment in countries where conditions are right. And structural reforms, such as those to strengthen labor force participation, could improve the outlook for potential output and thus encourage private investment.

The aim has been to address the fault lines that helped trigger one of the most devastating financial crises in a century, and to enable a more inclusive, stable financial system that promotes stability as well as economic development and growth. Islamic finance offers several features that are consistent with these objectives. Islamic finance refers to financial services that conform with Islamic jurisprudence, or Shari'ah, which bans interest, speculation, gambling and short-sales; requires fair treatment; and institutes sanctity of contracts. And these principles hold the promise of supporting financial stability, since a key tenet of Islamic finance is that lenders should share in both the risks and rewards of the projects and loans they finance.** ** Islamic finance has an important potential to act as an engine of stability and inclusion. Since investors are required to bear losses that may arise on loans. there is therefore less leverage, and greater incentive to exercise strong risk management. These risk-sharing features also serve to help ensure the soundness of individual financial institutions and help discourage the types of lending booms and real estate bubbles that were the precursors of the global financial crisis. The focus on asset-backed and risk-sharing financing also has the potential to improve access to finance by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and to support inclusive growth. It is well-suited to financing large-scale infrastructure projects, whereby'similar to public-private partnerships'investors finance the construction of roads, bridges, and similar projects, and receive the returns on these investments until the project reaches maturity. Finally, Islamic financial services also promise to improve financial inclusion for the large number of Muslims that are discouraged from using banks for religious reasons. **But what are the challenges to make this industry more mainstream and to allow it to grow in a safe and sound manner?** These and other issues are discussed in [new work by IMF staff. It found that for the industry to flourish it needs to: * Increase regulatory clarity and harmonization, in coordination with Islamic standard-setters, including on the treatment of profit-sharing investment accounts and disclosure requirements, but also on further clarification of the treatment of Shari'ah compliant instruments in the calculation of Basel III requirements; * Stress the importance of greater consistency in Shari'ah-compliance across and within countries; * Underscore the importance of developing safety nets'the protection of depositors and the provision of emergency liquidity'and frameworks that would allow Islamic institutions that may face difficulties to be resolved in a manner that avoids undue market disruption; * Reduce tax and regulatory impediments to risk-sharing financing; and * Deepen the market for Shari'ah compliant short- and long-term securities, through regular sovereign benchmark issues and clearer rules governing the treatment of collateral. **Strong demand** Islamic financial assets have grown at double-digit rates over the past decade, from about $200 billion in 2003 to an estimated $1.8 trillion at end of 2013.( A large part of Islamic finance'around 80 percent'is composed of Islamic banking assets; the remainder is composed of Sukuk (15 percent, asset- backed or asset-based instruments), Islamic funds (4 percent), and Takaful (Islamic insurance). Islamic banking now represents 15 percent or more of the banking system in ten countries in the Middle East and Asia. Issuance of Sukuk has increased twentyfold over the same period to reach $119.7 billion by 2013. The number and variety of issuers of Islamic financial assets looking to tap into these markets has grown to include Hong Kong SAR, Luxembourg, Senegal, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The economic and financial stability implications of the industry's growth are huge, as is the demand for policy advice in this area. **Tackling the challenges together** To allow this industry to develop in a safe and sound manner, the important challenges described above will need to be tackled. The IMF, with its universal membership, its surveillance mandate, its capacity building efforts, and its close involvement with both the conventional and Islamic setting bodies, has an important opportunity to help. _Stay tuned for more discussion of Islamic Finance at the upcoming IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.

To take stock, the IMF organized two conferences, the first in [2011, the second in [2013, and published the proceedings in two books, titled \"[In the Wake of the Crisis\" and \"[What Have We Learned?\". The time seems right for a third assessment. Research has continued, policies have been tried, and the debates have been intense. But have we truly made much progress? Are we closer to a new framework? To address these questions, Raghuram Rajan, Ken Rogoff, Larry Summers and I are organizing a third conference, \"[Rethinking Macro Policy III: Progress or Confusion?\" that will take place on April 15-16 at the IMF. Much of the discussion in recent years has centered (rightly) on the policy issues of the day: What measures to take during a financial or sovereign crisis, what to do at the zero lower bound, how to design quantitative easing, at what rate should fiscal consolidation take place? The focus of our conference will be instead on the architecture of policy when (hopefully) policy rates have become positive again, and most countries are growing and have stabilized debt-to-GDP ratios. In other words, how will/should macro policy look once the crisis is finally over? Here are some questions to start the discussion (I hope, in a later blog, to summarize the answers coming out of the conference). **Financial regulation** It is now well understood that the financial crisis resulted from the interaction of excessive leverage in the financial system and extensive interconnectedness and complexity of balance sheets of both banks and non banks. In other words, the crisis revealed the presence of large, undetected, systemic risks. Since then, much effort has gone toward improving our understanding and assessment of systemic risk**. Questions**: Where do we stand? Are some dimensions of systemic risk easier to measure (e.g., leverage in the banking sector vs. interconnectedness of banks and non-banks or risks outside the banking sector)? How should we assess the experience with stress- tests? And have we made enough progress in reducing systemic risk since the crisis, e.g., with Dodd-Frank, the Vickers commission, the Financial Stability Board, etc? **Macro Prudential Policies** Macro prudential tools, that is state-dependent regulations, are the new policy kids on the block. A standard example is maximum loan-to-value ratios, which can be adjusted as a function of the state of the housing market. Properly used, the argument goes, macro prudential tools can be designed and targeted to deal with the many dimensions of financial risk, allowing fiscal and monetary policy to deal with their traditional mandates. In practice however, the story is much less clean. Despite increasing experimentation, we are still grappling with which macro prudential tools to develop, how to use them, and the reliability of their effects. **Questions**: Do we have or can we develop tools to deal with the different types of risk, from high housing prices, to insufficient capital in some financial institutions, to sudden drops in liquidity in some financial markets? Using these tools in the right way not only requires substantial knowledge, but also raises political economy issues. In a housing boom, increasing the loan to value ratio may be politically difficult. **Questions:** Given these issues, when should we use macro prudential tools, or should we use tougher, non contingent financial regulation? To be concrete, should we aim for variable capital ratios and decide when to adjust them, or just give up on the variable part, and aim for high but constant capital ratios? Finally, it is clear that both financial regulation and macro prudential tools are likely to lead financial actors to adjust and explore ways of getting around them. **Questions:** In this game of cat and mouse, can the macro prudential regulators hope to win? Or will regulation and tools become increasingly complex and possibly counterproductive? **Monetary Policy**** ** Even before the crisis started, there were sharply different views on whether central banks should have a single mandate (price stability) or a dual mandate (price stability and stable economic activity). The crisis has intensified this debate. Indeed it has led to the suggestion that central banks should have a triple mandate, with financial stability added to the first two**. Questions**: Under the highly realistic assumption that financial regulation and macroprudential tools do not fully take care of financial stability, should monetary policy take financial stability into account? And if so, how? Can the interest rate or other monetary policy tools reduce financial risk? How should macro prudential tools and monetary policy be coordinated? Should they both be under the responsibility of the central bank? If this is the case, and central banks have tools which can have effects on very specific sectors of the economy, can they retain full independence? The zero (or as we are now discovering, the slightly negative) lower bound on the interest rate set by central banks was thought to be a theoretical curiosum, unlikely to happen, and, in any case, easy to combat if reached. If reached, central banks could, through announcements of future monetary policy, increase expected inflation and achieve large negative interest rates. We have learned that this was simply wishful thinking. The zero lower bound could be reached, inflation expectations are not easy to manipulate, and it may take a very long time to exit. **Questions**: What can we do if anything to avoid hitting the zero lower bound again? Are worries about secular stagnation and low or negative equilibrium real interest rates, and thus a higher likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound justified? When they encountered the zero lower bound, central banks extended the set of assets they were willing to purchase, these operations being known generically as Quantitative Easing, or QE. They have both changed the composition and vastly increased the size of their balance sheets. **Questions:** If and when economic conditions turn more favorable, and it is time to exit from the zero lower bound, should central banks eventually return to the traditional mode of intervening at the short end of the market, or should they continue to buy and sell longer maturity sovereign or corporate bonds? Should the balance sheets of central banks return to their pre-crisis size, or remain permanently larger? If the central bank intervenes along the yield curve, how should monetary policy and debt management by the Treasury be combined? Last but not least, central banks ended up providing liquidity to many agents at the height of the crisis, not only to banks but also to non-deposit taking institutions and (directly and indirectly) to sovereigns. **Questions**: Should central banks continue to provide such an extended lender-of-last resort role in tranquil times or should a narrower focus be retained? **Fiscal Policy** When the financial system froze, and monetary policy no longer worked, most advanced economies relied on fiscal policy to limit the decrease in demand, and in turn on output. The result of the combined drop in output and fiscal stimulus was a dramatic increase in the debt- to-GDP ratio. Since then, the focus has been on the rate at which this ratio should be first stabilized and then decreased. Turning to future policy, this story raises a number of issues. While the acute phase of \"fiscal austerity'' has passed, many issues will remain for decades to come. **Questions:** What is a dangerous level of debt? How do we think about fiscal space? Should fiscal accounting rely more on stochastic debt sustainability analysis? What are the multipliers associated with fiscal consolidation? What do we know about confidence effects? The rules governing fiscal policy in the European Union are widely perceived as too complex and suboptimal. Can one design better rules? Should the old idea of the fiscal golden rule, the separation of a current and of a capital account, be resurrected? Or is the potential for abuse just too large? If we have truly entered a period of secular stagnation, with an excess of saving leading to a negative real rate, doesn't it make sense for governments to run larger deficits and increase public investment? Most observers agree that the fiscal stimulus early in the crisis was instrumental in limiting the decrease in output. **Questions:** Doesn't this suggest that we should take more seriously the role of fiscal policy as a macro policy tool? Most countries allow for automatic stabilizers to dampen demand fluctuations, but these so-called stabilizers were never designed with stabilization in mind. Could they be improved--and why has there been so little thinking about it? **Capital inflows, exchange rate management and capital controls** The crisis has reinforced the notion that international capital flows can be very volatile, with emerging markets being particularly vulnerable. Policy makers have responded with a panoply of tools, from capital controls, to macro prudential measures aimed at shaping flows, and FX intervention. **Questions:** What have we learned? Do these tools work? When should they be used, and how should they be articulated with the rest of the macro toolbox? Are there important differences in how advanced economies and emerging markets use (and should use) these tools? And what does the experience since the crisis say about the optimal opening of the capital account, even in the long run? **The International Monetary and Financial System** The financial crisis played out on a global scale, and the international monetary system was tested as never before**. **Central banks had to extend swap lines. The IMF created programs to provide liquidity. Large capital flows, and large changes in exchange rates, triggered talk of currency wars. **Questions:** Can we live with the existing system? Can it be improved going forward? If domestic financial regulation is hard to design, cross border regulation is even harder; can we design and achieve cross-border financial regulation and limit the risks of international arbitrage? Can the hybrid system of international liquidity provision through swaps by central banks and liquidity provision by the IMF be improved? Should we reexamine the rules of the game for exchange rates? How can we improve on the process of sovereign debt restructuring? What should be the role of international forums such as the G20? As you can see, there is no shortage of questions to answer. While the conference is by invitation only due to space constraints, the sessions will be webcast. To follow it, and get more information please visit the [conference website. And, as I promised above, I shall try, in a post conference blog, to summarize at least some of the wisdom coming out the conference, and give tentative answers to at least some of the questions listed above.

Overcoming the Legacy of the Lost Decades", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=9200", "content": " [By [Changyong Rhee ( Abenomics can succeed, despite recent setbacks to growth and inflation, in revitalizing Japan by making steadfast progress on all three of its arrows equally and simultaneously, as we show in our [new book. This is also essential to avoid an undue weakening of the yen and ensure positive spillovers to Japan's neighbors, its region, and the global economy. **The Legacy: Structural Changes During the Lost Decades ** Most Japan followers will be familiar with the following striking statistic: in 2013, Japan's level of nominal GDP was about 6 percent below its mid 1990s level. During this period, three important structural changes have been a brake on growth and efforts to get out of deflation: * _Population aging_, which started in earnest around the mid-1990s, has been a drag on growth by reducing labor input, land prices, and aggregate demand, contributing to deflationary pressures (see chart 1). It has contributed to the erosion of the traditional tax base and increased government outlays on health care and social security, adding to Japan's fiscal woes. It also raised demand for 'safe assets,'\u009d limiting the financial sector's ability to be a catalyst for growth by providing risk capital. [ * _Production offshoring, _which initially contributed to the corporate deleveraging process, has recently occurred at the expense of domestic investment and exports from Japan (see chart 2), while higher corporate profits are increasingly retained as cash holdings. [ * _Labor market fragmentation._ Japan used to be famous for its lifetime employment model, especially for men in large companies, but a dramatic change has occurred in recent years with the emergence of nonregular workers, especially women and older workers. Excessive labor market duality has recently become an impediment for efforts to get out of deflation by limiting aggregate nominal wage and productivity growth (see chart 3). [ Past policy efforts to overcome these headwinds proved to be largely unsuccessful, due to their on-off and generally uncoordinated implementation and because of large shocks that beset the country just when the situation started to improve such as the Asian financial crisis, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. **Mutual synergies from implementing all three arrows** In early 2013, Japan embarked on a comprehensive and coordinated set of policies to end deflation, raise growth, secure fiscal sustainability, while maintaining financial stability. The so-called three arrows of Abenomics comprise aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and ambitious structural reforms. With the **first arrow**, ending deflation would reduce the government debt ratio and restore the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy. Further, it could rekindle animal spirits and stimulate productivity growth. As such, the aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan remains appropriate and instrumental in pushing up actual and expected inflation. Nonetheless, policy transmission appears relatively constrained: investment remains sluggish despite negative real interest rates, exports remain tepid despite the depreciation of the yen, and portfolio rebalancing towards higher-yielding assets remains limited. The rise in inflation expectations and tight labor market conditions are only slowly feeding through into higher basic wages. These modest effects are, in part, due to the structural headwinds mentioned earlier from aging, production outsourcing, and labor market duality suggesting that structural reforms are essential to help attain the 2 percent inflation target. The **second arrow** depends, in no small part, on the credibility of the government's fiscal adjustment strategy. This creates a difficult balancing act: one the one hand, fiscal policy needs to support the economic recovery, but at the same time it cannot lose sight of the large and ever increasing debt overhang. A concrete medium-term fiscal consolidation that aims to put debt on a downward trajectory through revenue measures and entitlement reforms remains the preferred solution to this dilemma: such a plan would provide assurances that the debt will be repaid, allowing greater scope in the near term for stimulus when downside risks materialize or structural fiscal measures are taken. The **third arrow **of ambitious structural reforms are pivotal for both the near-term and longer-lasting success of Abenomics. Groundbreaking structural reforms will already support demand in the near term as confidence and expectations of permanent income would rise. Furthermore, as we have seen recently in Europe, fiscal consolidation without faster growth is unlikely to succeed. In this regard, bold measures that raise the employment of women, older workers, and foreign labor are most needed as they would directly counteract the effects of population aging. Finally, the financial sector is not an innocent bystander in this debate and reforms should focus on jumpstarting the securitization market and stimulating venture capital to spur faster growth in funding for new business, and restructuring and exit of nonviable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the latter, entry and exit rates of SMEs in Japan are on average about one- third of those in advanced countries, which impedes credit intermediation and risk taking by deterring entry of new firms, expansion of healthy firms, and by eroding risk assessment capabilities at banks. _The IMF's new book '_[_Can Abenomics Succeed?

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) bear a disproportionately heavy burden. Their nonperforming loan ratios are on average more than double those of their larger corporate cousins. This is worrisome. SMEs are the lifeblood of the European economy, comprising 99 percent of all businesses and employing nearly two of every three workers in Europe. Given the importance of smaller businesses to the economy, addressing their problem loans could lay the foundation for a more robust and sustainable economic recovery. [ **Small businesses, big obstacles** SMEs in Europe are defined as employing fewer than 250 people and having annual sales of less than '\u00ac 50 million. Unfortunately, their small size often makes it harder for them to resolve their distressed loans. Large loan volumes, limited financial data about SMEs, and concentration of talent in a few key people for SMEs (management, shareholders, and employees) are serious obstacles. Generally, smaller businesses are more likely to suffer from lack of expertise in restructuring, costly or complex insolvency regimes, and higher costs of distressed financing. Strict insolvency laws often dampen entrepreneurial spirit by denying the owners of failed businesses the opportunity to start afresh. On top of these unique difficulties, small businesses share the same challenges as bigger corporations in the current environment: cash-strapped banks, weak insolvency systems and inadequate legal enforcement tools. **Help is on the way** European governments have taken measures, particularly to reform insolvency regimes, for example through out-of-court workouts. Some countries ' such as Cyprus, Greece, and Ireland ' have strengthened supervision of problem loan management in banks. The new [Single Supervisory Mechanism, led by the European Central Bank, is expected to harmonize nonperforming loan management oversight throughout the Eurozone. Governments have created tax and other economic incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises to restructure debt, as well as to facilitate access to financing. The European Commission is also lending a hand, creating targeted programs for SMEs and taking the first steps to provide legislative guidance to member countries. Despite these efforts, the pace of resolving small business problem loans remains too slow. Governments and banks need to do more. IMF staff recently [published a paper, collating experience and attempting to provide some practical policy solutions. ** Time for more action** Governments need to devise a comprehensive, coordinated strategy that provides both macro and microeconomic support including through insolvency reforms and enhanced banking supervision. They should consider introducing simpler, more cost-effective insolvency procedures for small firms. Time is money. While creditors deliberate, the value of a business goes down. It is like arguing on how to divide a melting ice cream. International experience has shown that 'enhanced'\u009d out-of-court workouts, including some judicial elements or mediation, are essential to restructure debt more quickly and more cheaply. Combined with other reforms, this could give entrepreneurs of failed ventures a chance to shed unsustainable debt and make a fresh start, subject to reasonable safeguards. As banks are in most cases the main creditors, tougher banking supervision would provide more incentives for banks to tackle their problem loans such as by exiting quickly nonviable firms and assisting in the restructuring of viable, but distressed firms. Europe's entrepreneurs and smaller businesses could be the backbone of the European recovery, but too many are currently hobbled by problem loans. Resolving this situation would free up precious resources to help healthy SMEs flourish and new ones emerge. It's time to make small beautiful again.

If nothing is done, the prospect of settling into a 'new mediocre'\u009d will become reality, especially in advanced economies. In many advanced economies, accommodative monetary policies, growth-friendly fiscal frameworks, and efforts to tackle private debt overhang and improve tax revenues and compliance are essential to lift economic growth in the short term. To jumpstart and sustain growth over the longer-term, reforms to strengthen labor force participation, raise productivity by removing impediments to efficient allocation of resources, encourage competition, and encourage innovation and technology-uptake are crucial. The key question is how to identify, prioritize, and calibrate the reforms that best suit each country's situation. We look closely at what can be done to boost potential growth in a [new study that examines trends in productivity and labor and capital inputs in different sectors and across countries. **Problem started before the crisis** Continued sluggish growth in advanced economies partly reflects the scale of the public and private balance sheet damage that occurred during the crisis and the slow process of shedding debt since then. But the underlying output and productivity growth in most advanced economies had, in fact, already been slowing well before the global financial crisis (Figure 1). This trend may have been masked by the ups and downs of the financial cycle, along with some productivity bursts driven by technology and reforms before the crisis. [ To boost jobs and growth, we at the IMF have advocated measures to increase labor force participation, especially by increasing economic opportunities for women (see [here). More broadly, the slowdown in productivity even prior to the crisis puts a high premium on reforms in labor and product markets, increasing infrastructure investment, and incentivizing innovation and skills development.

For example, the euro area' despite some favorable news recently ' faces marked-down growth prospects alongside high levels of public debt. The combination of high debt and tepid potential growth underscores the importance of improving prospects for sustained growth and safe and resilient public finances. A fundamental question then arises: what is the relation between fiscal consolidation and structural reform? Clearly, fiscal structural reform can help build sound, strong, resilient and growth-friendly fiscal institutions. One example is provided by letting automatic stabilizers ' the fiscal automatic shock absorbers ' work in both directions to help smooth fluctuations in economic activity. Increased stability, in turn, has a surprisingly strong impact on economic growth (look for our spring edition of the IMF's _Fiscal Monitor_, to be issued on April 8 for more details). But, more generally, fiscal frameworks are a crucial part of macroeconomic risk management, as discussed in my recent blog on '[Dams and Dikes for Public Finances'\u009d. Prudent conduct of fiscal policy is a cornerstone for stable and sustainable growth. There are at least three further roles that fiscal policy can play in supporting growth. First, structural reform may rely on fiscal instruments for its implementation. Second, fiscal policy can help bring about political consensus for structural reform. Third, fiscal policy can help manage the timing of the benefits of reform, facilitating the transition. Labor market reform illustrates these three roles. Labor market reform may use fiscal instruments. Reducing labor taxes and social security contributions can positively impact employment and economic activity. While there are direct budgetary costs, these can be reduced by targeting reductions to specific groups. Figure 1 illustrates the effectiveness of targeted employer social security contributions'for the elderly in the case of Germany and youth in the case of Sweden'as employment growth in the targeted segments outpaced that of the broader population. [ Fiscal policy can also be used to compensate groups adversely affected by the proposed structural reform. A typical example occurs when changes in employment protection are bundled together with measures that benefit employees. Figure 2 shows that in the 1990s, Sweden and Finland enacted labor tax cuts in parallel with reductions in employment protection. [ Fiscal policy can also offset possible detrimental economic effects of reform in the short term, which buys time for the long-term benefits to materialize. For example, short-run demand support can be achieved through productive public investment, the conditions for which will be provided in the forthcoming IMF policy paper on 'Making Public Investment More Efficient.'\u009d This is especially appropriate when interest rates are close to zero (often referred to as the zero lower bound), when fiscal multipliers are larger, and the potential negative impacts of some reforms may also be more pronounced. Figure 3 presents the implications of a reduction in employment protection legislation, which is particularly costly in terms of output losses. The simulations suggest that fiscal policy can offset the potential short-term economic costs of reform, although it would also increase public debt slightly in the near term. [ But how to assess the macroeconomic support role of fiscal policy for structural reform? A number of principles can be advanced. First, fiscal policy must ensure debt sustainability and market confidence. Second, there must be a credible commitment to see the structural reform through to fruition. Third, there needs to be a good estimate of the costs and benefits of the reform and how they will materialize over time. Fourth, an overall assessment of the macroeconomic situation and prospects is required. These are clearly difficult and complex issues that we will continue to explore in order to fully take advantage of the potential complementarities between fiscal and structural policies.

Ghosh, [Mahvash S. Qureshi As with previous crises, the global financial crisis has prompted greater calls for international policy cooperation, but it still remains very much like _Nessie_, the lovable [Loch Ness monster: oft-discussed, seldom seen. To reflect on the obstacles to international policy cooperation, and how to make progress, the IMF recently hosted a panel discussion, _Toward a More Cooperative International Monetary System: Perspectives from the Past, Prospects for the Future_, with Maurice Obstfeld (CEA; University of Berkley), Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Ocampo (Columbia University), Alexandre Swoboda (The Graduate Institute, Geneva), and Paul Volcker (Former Chairman, Federal Reserve). The very term 'cooperation'\u009d is ill-defined, and means different things to different people. At its most basic level, cooperation might simply mean explaining the logic of domestic policy actions to others. If used in this sense, then cooperation has happened in the past, and is on an upward trend'not least with central banks being more transparent domestically'which is surely a good thing. Taken to the next level, cooperation could refer to the creation of multilateral institutions and arrangements. If so, we have made progress on that front as well. Examples include the provision of liquidity through central bank swap lines, and new IMF liquidity provision facilities set up after the global financial crisis. If, however, cooperation refers to setting, and following, some well-defined 'rules of the road,'\u009d then we have not had them since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system. The principles that we do have are generally too vague and hobbled by conceptual disagreements to be of much practical use. For instance, we all agree that exchange rates should not stray too far from equilibrium values; but determining the equilibrium value, and how far is too far, are in practice fraught with difficulties. When economists refer to cooperation, they generally have the highest degree of cooperation in mind'that is, moving from the Nash to the coordinated equilibrium. This definition is more ambitious, and arguably more useful. If that's the case, then Nessie has indeed rarely been seen, with just a handful of sightings in the past forty years: Bonn, Plaza, Louvre, and the Group of Twenty fiscal stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis. Debating these various facets of cooperation in light of historical experience, five key insights emerged from the discussions: **Constants in a changing world.** The core challenges to the international monetary system'facilitating external adjustment; ensuring an equitable burden of adjustment between surplus and deficit countries; and regulating the supply of global liquidity'have been constant through the decades. But they have magnified with increased financial integration, the growing volume of private capital flows, and the emergence of complex financial systems prone to excesses. **Misaligned incentives**. Countries act together when they are scared together'step away from the abyss, and the incentive to coordinate seems to melt away. Coordination is mostly possible when it involves countries moving policies in a direction that would individually be in their self-interest regardless of what other countries do; though whose benefit may be greater if countries agree to act together. Coordination is, however, much harder when it involves governments implementing quite different policies from those they would have chosen on their own, and that make sense only if _all parties_ deliver on their respective commitments. That is why the Group of Twenty coordinated their fiscal expansions during the global financial crisis, and why it has been possible to reach agreement on financial sector regulation'such as the Basel agreements on financial stability'but other examples of coordination have been few and far between. **Net ****_and_**** gross.** Attempts at coordination are rare enough, but the few times they have occurred, it has been when imbalances in net flows (and, therefore, exchange rate misalignments) have been apparent. But whether in the 1920s or in the 2000s, important vulnerabilities may be building up from [gross positions long before then, through cross-border bank flows and oversized banking systems. **Stretching the truth**. Beyond genuine uncertainty, a major obstacle to coordination has often been deliberate disagreements about [cross-border multipliers. Unbiased analysis of domestic and cross-border effects of policies from a respected third party'a 'neutral assessor'\u009d'might help to build consensus and achieve more cooperative outcomes. Whether the IMF could play such a role is an open question, but improved analysis of cross-border spillovers is surely a move in the right direction. **Keep it simple.** Given the obstacles to coordination, simple 'rules of the road'\u009d indicators based on reserves accumulation or current account balances may be more effective to secure superior outcomes than trying to achieve the theoretically-optimal cooperative solution through tailor-made polices. (By analogy, the 'Volcker Rule'\u009d in domestic finance.) Of course, as with any rule, there are many questions about how simple the rules should be, and'especially in the sovereign context'how these can be enforced. So where do we go from here? There are formidable obstacles to international policy cooperation. Let's not forget that even within the national domain, cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities'not to mention the macro prudential regulator'is not always a straightforward task. Global cooperation in the spheres of international health and trade'more advanced than in macro policy, though still far from perfect'took decades of building technical and political consensus. So rather than a piecemeal approach, we need to be persistent in our efforts and build on existing institutions and modalities such as the IMF's [Integrated Surveillance Decision and multilateral surveillance products, to help craft some _simple_ rules of the road. Otherwise, we fear, it will be yet another case of 'when all is said and done, more will have been said than done.'\u009d No, we are not likely to spot Nessie any time soon'but at least we have not given up looking for her.

She 'shows her power where virtue has not been put in order to resist her and therefore turns her impetus where she knows that dams and dikes have not been made to contain her.'\u009d Managing the ebb and flow of government's fiscal fortunes poses similar challenges today. We need a risk-based approach to fiscal policymaking that applies a systematic analysis of potential sources of fiscal vulnerabilities. This method would help countries detect potential problems early, and would allow for institutional changes to build resilience. Before the 1970s, sharp public debt increases were associated with the World Wars and Depression (Figure 1). But in the 1970s, the pattern changed and public debt began a steadily rising trend. In the 1990s debt to GDP leveled off as advanced and emerging market economies strengthened policies and growth was strong. But the global financial crisis restored the earlier upward trend. Meanwhile, liabilities generally not reflected in debt figures'such as public pension and health costs'have continued to accumulate. [ Not only is government debt at unprecedented levels in peacetime, but government debt only gives a partial view of public finances. In isolation it can be misleading. Today, risks to public finances are significant. As will be described in the _Fiscal Monitor, _due out on April 15, clear and present risks arise from low growth and low inflation in the euro area and Japan. Developing economies face pressures coming from adverse changes in exchange rates and financing conditions. More recently, sharply lower oil prices and persistently low commodity prices are hurting commodity exporters. Contingent liabilities to struggling banks and troubled public enterprises pose additional sources of risk, oftentimes materializing when macro fundamentals are weak. Moreover, when an adequate institutional setup is lacking, these contingent liabilities can be difficult to limit ex-ante because the state typically serves as the insurer of last resort whenever something goes wrong in the economy. Once realized, these risks can quickly spillover into regional and even global crises. In this context of high debt and latent risks, several key policy questions come to the fore. How can public finances be made safe in a world full of risks? How can these risks be usefully estimated and analyzed? How can fiscal policy contribute to mitigating those risks and promoting more sustainable and inclusive growth? Most frameworks used to analyze fiscal risks rely'explicitly or implicitly'on a number of unexamined assumptions concerning the behavior and relevance of those risks. Specifically, they assume that fiscal risks are **independent** (the realization of one risk does not make the realization of any other risk more or less likely), **symmetric** (positive and negative shocks to the public finances are equally likely and equally beneficial/costly), and **linear** (the costs/benefits increase proportionally with the size of the underlying disturbance). The global crisis provided a costly lesson in the limitations of such assumptions. It reminded us that, in fact: 1. **Fiscal risks are highly correlated**: When it comes to public finances, bad news really does 'come in threes.'\u009d Figure 2 illustrates the perfect storm of fiscal shocks for the 10 countries hardest hit by the crisis. Not only were there multiple sources of increases in debt, but these were also systematically linked: undisclosed general government deficits (such as skeletons in subnational government accounts); adverse macroeconomic developments; contingent liabilities to the financial sector, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private-public partnerships (PPPs); and the government's own discretionary policy response to the crisis. [ 2. **Fiscal risks are asymmetric:** Politicians are quick to 'bank'\u009d upside risks to their fiscal forecasts; and are prone to downplay or overlook downside risks. Nowhere is this more evident than in the way countries treat contingent assets and liabilities. Government forecasts often include revenues from future asset sales to reduce borrowing requirements, even though the precise amount or timing of the sale is uncertain. By contrast, governments typically exclude contingent liabilities, like guarantees, because it is uncertain whether or when they will be called. The result is a forecast in which the balance of risks is skewed, with downside risks consistently understated. Figure 3 illustrates the optimistic bias by EU countries in forecasting government debt over the last 12 years. [ 3. **Fiscal risks are non-linear**. For small disturbances it is reasonable to assume that costs increase proportionally to the size of the disturbance. However, in extreme events, the associated financial, economic, social and political consequences can be much greater. Once markets perceive government debt to be unsustainable, spiraling interest rates and depreciating exchange rates can ensue. In some cases, countries may suffer a 'sudden stop,'\u009d simply cut-off from market access. This non-linear relationship between economic shocks and their consequences can give rise to what [Olivier Blanchard calls 'dark corners,'\u009d situations in which the economy can badly malfunction. The combination of high debt levels with fiscal risks that are highly correlated, asymmetric, and non-linear demands a new approach to fiscal policymaking'one in which fiscal risk analysis actively informs the most important fiscal decisions. Elements of this more risk-based approach to fiscal policymaking are already in place in a growing number of countries, Many countries produce not only point estimates of the path of government finances but also **alternative macro-fiscal scenarios** which present the fiscal implications of changes in key macroeconomic assumptions (for example those published by EU countries as part of their Stability Programs). Some countries now produce **statements of fiscal risk** identifying the sources, magnitude, and, in some cases, likelihood of discontinuous risk to public finances (an example is the comprehensive fiscal risk statement published by the Philippines). A few countries bring these two approaches together into **stochastic projections** **of the key fiscal aggregates**. The UK Office of Budget Responsibility presents its forecasts in the form of probabilistic 'fan charts,'\u009d which highlight the degree of uncertainty around their central estimate for growth and government borrowing. These projections are then used to estimate the probability of the UK government meeting its stated medium-term fiscal objectives. In most cases, however, risk analysis is produced to satisfy a legal or multilateral requirement or relegated to an appendix of the national budget document. The IMF has already taken some important steps to improve and inform fiscal risk analysis among its members. A number of tools are already in place, including the fan charts in the Fund's [debt sustainability analyses and work on future liabilities from age-related spending. We also provide [heat maps in fiscal transparency evaluations, already published for Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ireland, Mozambique, Portugal, and Russia. Going forward, we will consider how to better measure, prevent and minimize fiscal risks by taking into account their correlated, asymmetric and non- linear characteristics. We will also explore how to mainstream fiscal risk assessments into fiscal decision making. This analysis will be part of a comprehensive approach to fiscal policymaking that also provides guidance on: enhancing fiscal transparency, including adoption of international accounting standards; analyzing and forecasting public sector balance sheets; and setting appropriate medium-term fiscal objectives that balance inclusive growth, stability, and risk management. It will also take account of the role of targeted public investments, structural reforms, and improvements in fiscal institutions in building resilience, supporting growth, and generating greater 'upside risk'\u009d for public finances. Machiavelli long ago recognized that to tame violent rivers (and fortune), one could, 'when times are quiet, provide for them with dikes and dams so that when they rise later, either they go in a canal or their impetus is neither so wanton nor so damaging.'\u009d As some measure of calm returns to the battered global economy, today's challenge is to construct the framework of dikes and dams for public finances which will enable countries better to weather the next storm.

As a result, more households default on their mortgages and the crisis deepens. A new [IMF Working Paper studies the differences in the housing crises and policy responses in Iceland, Ireland, Spain, and the United States, and argues that crisis policies geared to provide temporary debt service relief for struggling households, followed by durable loan modifications, can help break this vicious circle. **Why policymakers worry about mortgage distress** The recent global financial crisis affected many countries, but those with previous housing booms and high mortgage debt typically suffered deeper and longer recessions. One reason is that housing busts and high debt can amplify the initial shock. For instance, property markets may get flooded from forced home sales by overindebted households. The resulting fall in house prices then further reduces the wealth of all homeowners and induces them to cut consumption, which slows the economy even more. We saw this cycle play out in the recent housing crises in Iceland, Ireland, Spain, and the United States, although with different intensity (Chart 1). For sure, it is best to avoid housing-related boom-bust cycles, as emphasized in previous work on [housing recoveries. However, once mortgage default becomes widespread, a crisis resolution strategy is needed. While the experience shows that there is no 'one-size-fits-all'\u009d solution, there are a few policies that could help to curtail the downward spiral resulting from severe housing busts. [ **Providing breathing space with temporary forbearance** In all four countries, lenders offered debt service relief through temporary forbearance in one form or another, for instance by reducing mortgage payments to interest only for a limited time. While forbearance can help households to adjust their consumption more smoothly, it also invites free riding by some borrowers not under severe financial distress. Lenders should therefore consider temporary forbearance only for borrowers who are currently under proven financial strain but have sufficiently strong prospects to recover their debt service capacity. In any case, lenders must closely monitor forborne loans. **Foreclosure will have to play a role** Foreclosure has been widespread in some countries, particularly in the US, while largely absent in others, such as Ireland (Chart 2). [ It is important to remind that foreclosure has both benefits and costs. On one hand, strong foreclosure rights decrease lenders' loan losses and contain opportunistic behavior by borrowers. On the other hand, large scale foreclosures can depress house prices and trigger more defaults. These negative effects become more significant in systemic housing crises. In some countries, a foreclosure moratorium was introduced to delay or reduce foreclosure activity. However, the experience was mixed at best. Delays in the foreclosure process have been found to increase opportunistic defaults and overall workout costs. Instead, making foreclosure more costly through temporary fees or taxes could be more efficient in incentivizing lenders to consider foreclosure alternatives in a systemic crisis. **Time to modify** A loan modification is a one-time, permanent amendment to the terms of a loan which reduces the monthly debt service payments. The most common type of loan modification is a maturity extension which reduces the monthly amortization payments. Loan modifications can help homeowners drowning in debt to overcome their debt servicing difficulties. The recovery from housing crises typically causes a rebound of incomes and house prices, helping many overindebted households to get back on their feet. While determining the right type of loan modification is difficult at the height of a crisis, the recovery phase will make it much easier to pin down suitable modification terms. Loan modifications during the recovery phase therefore dovetail well with temporary forbearance arrangements as crisis stopgap. Available statistics suggest that more than 10 percent of mortgages underwent some type of modification or restructuring in each of the four countries (Chart 3). This outcome was often supported by dedicated policies, such as the Homeowner Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) in the US and supervisory workout targets in Ireland. [ However, high renegotiation costs and other obstacles, such as prudential rules and taxes, have prevented a much higher extent of loan modification. It is therefore important to strengthen policies where needed to reduce barriers to modifications, while at the same time setting tight eligibility criteria to contain free riding. For instance, frameworks for orderly debt renegotiation, such as a code of conduct or a statutory insolvency framework, can help improve coordination between lenders and borrowers. Also, prudential or fiscal policies can set appropriate incentives to encourage loan modifications. **Reducing distress through across-the-board debt relief** Across-the-board debt relief provides immediate relief to many mortgagees. In Iceland, broad-based debt relief was in part facilitated by foreign bank creditors bearing the losses. However, in many circumstances, the economic benefit of broad-based debt relief is outweighed by its high upfront cost which would eventually need to be covered by taxpayers. In conclusion, different country circumstances suggest that there cannot be a 'one-size-fits-all'\u009d approach. Policy formulation must therefore take into account country specific factors as well as the stage of the recovery. In the direct aftermath of systemic housing crises, policies can facilitate temporary forbearance to provide breathing space to overindebted households, yet forbearance must remain selective and time-bound. In the subsequent recovery phase, policies should foster a durable resolution of distress, including by facilitating loan modification. It is important to bear in mind that foreclosure has negative side effects, particularly during systemic housing crises. However, foreclosure remains an efficient resolution tool in some cases and provides an important incentive for constructive borrower behavior.

This relative resilience was particularly impressive considering its most important trading and financial partner, the United States, was the epicenter of the crisis. Part of Canada's success story lies in the fact that its banking system is dominated by a handful of large players who are well capitalized and have safe, conservative, and profitable business models concentrated in mortgage lending'much of it covered by mortgage insurance and backstopped by the federal government. Notwithstanding such an enviable record and sound financial system, we need to keep an eye on certain financial risks. **Risks to watch** The IMF's recent [report on Canada's economy raises some concerns in the wake of substantially lower oil prices. The economy's two main domestic vulnerable areas are its overheated housing markets and high household debt. Although household debt levels appear to have stabilized recently, they have increased to historical highs over the past decade, reaching over 150 percent of disposable income'one of the highest among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. [ Meanwhile, house prices have risen more than 60 percent nationwide since 2000. Major metro areas have led the run-up in prices, including Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver'the latter recently ranked second in terms of the lowest affordability globally after Hong Kong. But with weaker terms of trade, lower growth, and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates, Canada's overvalued housing market may be cooling off. For example, there have been some recent signs that home listings to sales are rising noticeably in oil-rich Alberta, and we will need to keep an eye on the risk of a hard landing. Over the past several years, Canada has taken numerous steps to reduce the economy's vulnerabilities through policies designed to keep financial institutions and the financial system as a whole safer. [ Slower mortgage credit growth and higher quality borrowers, for example, appear to be the direct result of tighter lending standards (such as lower amortization periods, higher down payments, and house price caps) on insured mortgages. These steps may have been only partially effective in restraining credit growth. A possible sign of 'leakage'\u009d from tighter financial rules in Canada'which is a general problem that countries can face after tightening such rules'involves the expanding role of uninsured mortgages. These loans with loan-to-value ratio below 80 percent are not subject to the same regulatory tightening. These now comprise the bulk of mortgage originations and help fuel housing demand. For example, house price increases concentrated in single'family homes in fast-growing real estate markets seem tied to uninsured mortgages. If financial risks start rising again, policymakers may need to take further action to tighten rules on these loans. Over time, Canada would also benefit from reforming the government's role in mortgage insurance and reducing taxpayer's exposure to the associated risks. Limiting the federal backstop would increase private sector risk sharing and can further encourage prudence. Given the system's current reliance on insured mortgages, however, changes would need to be gradual to steadily encourage the private sector's role to expand as the public sector's recedes. **Connecting the dots** What else can Canada do to improve resilience of the financial system? Looking ahead, a broader issue is strengthening Canada's policy frameworks designed to keep the overall financial system safe. But there is a healthy debate over what approach works best. While informal cooperation between key agencies worked well during the crisis, future shocks will inevitably look different. From our perspective at the IMF, having robust frameworks with more formal arrangements already in place to identify and respond to future shocks would enhance resilience. Two key steps are worth considering. First, providing a mandate for macroprudential oversight of the financial system as a whole to a single entity would strengthen accountability and reinforce policymakers' ability to identify and respond to future potential crises. Such a body should have participation broad enough to 'connect the dots'\u009d and form a complete and integrated view of systemic risks with powers to collect the required data. Second, putting in place a coordination framework to support timely decision- making and test the capacity of both federal and provincial authorities to respond to crisis scenarios would benefit crisis preparedness. Extending the institutional arrangements and frameworks along these lines can help support both the capacity and willingness to act, especially at times of financial stress, and strengthen Canada's financial system and economy.

In general, oil importers will enjoy faster growth, lower inflation, and stronger external positions, and most will not encounter any significant fiscal pressures. Oil exporters will tend to face slower growth and weaker external current account balances and some will run into fiscal pressures, since many rely on direct oil-related revenues. One country that stands out is Venezuela, which had been experiencing severe economic imbalances before oil prices began to fall and now finds itself in an even more precarious position. [ **A new reality** Many countries are adapting well to this new global environment by allowing lower world oil prices to pass through into lower domestic energy costs. This increases the disposable income of consumers and businesses through cheaper costs for transportation and electricity. This policy supports growth and eases inflationary pressures. It also helps stabilize the external current account balance by stimulating demand for non-oil imports, which can partly offset the decline in oil imports. In Latin America and the Caribbean, our estimates suggest that 60 percent of these countries'such as Barbados, Costa Rica and Guatemala'will allow for a full pass through from world to domestic fuel prices by end 2015, while less than 30 percent will not allow any pass through.** ** [ **Cuts both ways: impact on fiscal balances**** ** For **net oil importers**, world oil prices can affect fiscal balances in several ways that may offset each other. The value of taxes on oil imports (both value-added taxes as well as ad valorem import duties) will probably decline, but the costs of fuel subsidies may decline as well, especially if the government does not allow full pass through of the decline in world oil prices. Our analysis suggests that the fiscal position in most net oil importing countries would strengthen moderately by the decline in world oil prices. The fiscal position in some of these countries is improving because the governments are not allowing the full pass through of lower world oil prices into domestic fuel prices. But the effect of world oil prices on the fiscal position in **net oil exporters** (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela) is negative. In most of these countries, a state-owned oil company dominates this sector, which provides fiscal revenues through income taxes, dividends, and royalties paid to the government. These companies may hold monopolies on domestic sales of petroleum products and may bear the costs of domestic fuel subsidies. **Ecuador, Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago** have already begun to curb spending to offset the decline in hydrocarbons-related revenues. The Mexican government is raising the domestic price of gasoline by 1.9 percent in 2015, which will enhance the revenues from domestic sales, and it purchased insurance from the market that helped limit the decline in oil-related revenues in 2015. The government will need to undertake additional fiscal adjustment in 2016, since this insurance provided a hedge for just 2015. **[Colombia** relies on a fiscal rule that spreads out the adjustment to shifts in world oil prices. This means the fiscal deficit will widen in 2015, with the fall in oil-related revenues. However, in the coming years the government will need to raise non-oil revenues to reach the legal targets for the structural fiscal balance while protecting key expenditure programs. **Bolivia** will experience a significant loss in revenues, since the price of its natural gas exports are linked to spot world oil prices, but the government has built up considerable buffers of deposits and net international reserves to give itself room for maneuver in the near team. The fiscal position of **Venezuela** will suffer the most from the decline in world oil prices, as its public sector derives a large share of its fiscal revenues from oil exports. In addition, the domestic price of gasoline is expected to remain close to zero, which virtually eliminates any potential revenues from domestic sales. Fiscal difficulties in Venezuela could create pressures on countries that import oil from Venezuela through the Petrocaribe arrangement'a Venezuelan energy-assistance program for some Central American and Caribbean countries. In many of these countries, the decline in the value of oil imports exceeds the projected financing from Petrocaribe. However, many countries use the subsidy component of Petrocaribe financing to support long-term spending, and could face a difficult fiscal adjustment if this source of financing were to be cut. **Policy implications** The new outlook for world oil prices will benefit some countries, while presenting challenges for others. In general, this new outlook does not pose a threat to macroeconomic stability in the region, because most countries will continue to maintain sound policy frameworks. The notable exception is Venezuela, where the significant loss in oil export revenues will aggravate a situation that was already tenuous. For those countries that have not done so already, the drop in oil prices provides a good opportunity to eliminate poorly targeted subsidies and to establish pricing mechanisms that allow for an automatic adjustment of domestic prices to changes in international fuel prices. The new global environment also underscores the importance of diversifying the sources of fiscal revenue to avoid an overreliance on fiscal income from either oil exports or imports.

A new IMF book, [_Designing a European Fiscal Union: Lessons from the Experience of Fiscal Federations_, published by Routledge, examines the experience of 13 federal states to help inform the debate on this issue. It analyzes in detail their practices in devolving responsibilities from the subnational to the central level, compares them to those of the European Union, and draws lessons for a possible future fiscal union in Europe. The book sets out to answer three sets of questions: (1) What is the role of centralized fiscal policies in federations, and hence the size, features, and functions of the central budget? (2) What institutional arrangements are used to coordinate fiscal policy between the federal and subnational levels? (3) What are the links between federal and subnational debt, and how have subnational financing crises been handled, when they occurred? Federations have addressed these issues in many different ways, but four features stand out when comparing their practices to those of the European Union. * **Unlike federations, the EU's budget is extremely small and nearly entirely dependent on transfers from its members.** Even in highly decentralized federations, the large size of the central budget, with its own taxing capacity, allows it to play an important stabilizing role (see Chart 1). In contrast, the European Union has no economically-meaningful center and fiscal risk-sharing is nearly non existent. It remains to be seen whether this arrangement can survive as a permanent EU feature or whether a stronger form of fiscal centralization will be required. [ * **Fiscal discipline in the European Union is long on institutions but short on shared policy instruments. **Partly because it opted for a small central budget, the European Union relies much more than existing federations on an extensive set of institutional arrangements to ensure fiscal discipline (see Chart 2). But this raises significant enforcement, and thus credibility, challenges that will also have to be addressed. [ * **Shared debt is rarely seen in federations.** Some of the proposals recently put forward in the euro area, such as common debt issuance and self-standing lending facilities for crisis support, are not a permanent feature of federations, although they have played a role in the early life of federations. * **Subnational financial crises have often, but not always, shaped fiscal responsibility sharing arrangements in federations.** The role and size of the central government in federations reflects a combination of historical circumstances and social and political preferences. For example, the most decentralized federations are often those where states were independent entities before the establishment of the federation-cases that may be more relevant for the European Union. On the other hand, a succession of severe and protracted sub-national financial crises led to the introduction of substantial constraints on local budgets in a previously relatively decentralized federation like Brazil. The current crisis in the euro area may thus influence the future shape of the union beyond the resolution of the financing crisis itself. Given the challenging economic and political circumstances in Europe, it may well be impractical to expect a prompt, well-articulated response to these questions. But the concrete experiences of federations do shed light on the decisions and trade-offs that the European Union will likely have to face in a not so distant future.

Unfortunately, that promise remains largely ignored and its potential untapped. In too many countries, too many legal restrictions conspire against women to be economically active'to work. What can be done to remove these barriers? A [new study done by IMF economists seeks to answer that question. The bottom line? It's about a fair, level playing field. **We can all do better** Despite some progress over the past few years, [gender-based legal restrictions remain significant. Almost 90 percent of countries have at least one important restriction in the books, and some have many. These range from the requirement for women to seek their husband's permission to work, to laws that restrict women's participation in specific professions. Others constrain the ability of women to own property, or to inherit, or to obtain a loan. [ **Ties that bind** [Our new study finds a strong relationship between legal restrictions and female labor market participation. In 50 percent of the countries studied, equity was reflected in law. When this happened, female labor participation rates increased by at least 5 percentage points over the following five years. [ Think about the tremendous potential here. Countries ranging from Kenya and Namibia to Peru have made legal changes and reaped the benefits. Sometime all it takes is just a couple of laws to change. Peru is a great example. In 1993, the new constitution granted equality between men and women under the law, and it eliminated discrimination by guaranteeing equal opportunities for work. Customary law (that is, traditional rules of practice) was invalidated if it contradicted these rights. Concurrently, as a result, women's labor force participation increased by a striking 15 percent. Other factors also play a role, of course. Demographics, education, and policies that include the provision of child care and maternity leave benefits all help [boost female labor participation. But legal rights are fundamental. [ **Leveling the playing field** There are big differences across the globe in female labor force participation. Women make up 40 percent of the global labor force. Yet only 21 percent of women in the Middle East and North Africa work outside the home versus 63 percent in East Asia, the Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa. Given these very different circumstances, there is no single solution to the gender gap problems. We need a multi-pronged approach'one that is tailored to the country's conditions, and social and religious norms. But in any event, to bring more women into the workforce and increase growth, we need to level the playing field'eliminate legal discrimination against women. Removing legal restrictions can yield fast results in boosting female labor supply. Increasing women's economic participation can, in turn, lead to higher growth. By some [estimates, raising female labor force participation to the respective levels of men would increase GDP by 5 percent in the United States, 9 percent in Japan, 12 percent in the United Arab Emirates, and 34 percent in Egypt. It makes economic sense to increase women's labor participation. Our study also finds that the introduction of more equity in property rights or in the pursuit of a job or a profession does not have to come at the expense of male employment. This can be a win-win outcome. **So what are we doing about it?** The IMF looks at these issues mainly through the economic prism of greater gender equality. We are contributing to this agenda through analytical work and regular health checks'known as Article IV consultations'with each of our member countries. What we find is that issues related to women's participation in the labor force have important economic consequences, particularly in countries where there is a need to find new sources of growth, for instance where populations are aging rapidly. Clearly, there is still a lot of work to be done but having more equal laws and regulations is a good place to start. By helping women reach their full economic potential, we can also help boost growth, prosperity and stability for the whole world. In a world in search of growth, women will help find it, if they face a level playing field instead of an insidious conspiracy! _For more information: [www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1502.htm _ ", "index": 254}, {"pub": "2/19/2015", "title": "Investment in the Euro Area: Why Has It Been So Weak?", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8897", "content": " By [Bergljot Bj\u00c3\u00b8rnson Barkbu, [S.

Meanwhile, another significant shift has taken place in recent months that is just as surprising and has wide-reaching global implications'the dramatic drop in long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields. The last time we saw 10-year Treasury bond yields this low was in early May 2013. As many will remember, this [didn't last long and when it corrected, it set off a burst of volatility across emerging markets. [ The sharp drop in this key global interest rate has occurred despite the general strength of the U.S. economy, the positive news coming from recent data, and the broad consensus among analysts that the day is soon approaching when the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates. [ **A term premium story** Once you strip out changes in the expected path of future short term rates, it becomes clear that it is the term premium'the compensation that investors require for holding a long-term bond rather than rolling over a sequence of short-term bonds'that has been responsible for a big chunk of the fall in Treasury rates. The term premium has actually turned _negative_ since the start of the year. Looking back in history, this is a rather abnormal occurrence. [ **So what is going on?** While likely reflecting a combination of factors, there are a number of candidate explanations: * **The disinflation vortex**. Some believe that long-run inflation in the United States could become permanently stuck below the Fed's goal of 2 percent. As a consequence, holders of longer maturity bonds would need less compensation for future inflation. Certainly, market pricing of inflation breakevens has been falling, something that has been highlighted by the FOMC in [recent statements. However, we have our doubts whether expectations of falling inflation are a big part of the story. Survey data seem to show that inflation expectations have not moved much.** ** **[** * **Fear over greed**. Increasing global risk aversion is another possibility. With events in Ukraine, Greece, and the Middle East, investors have decided to take risk off the table and are heading to the gold standard of safe assets: U.S. Treasuries. While this is likely part of the story, the current unusually low levels of Treasury yields still seem incongruent with the market pricing of volatility. [ * ** ****A scarcity of safe assets**. The recent improving fiscal positions in some of the large industrial countries, including the United States, has reduced the net supply of global safe assets. At the same time, the largest central banks (in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the euro area) have either bought or are intending to buy a significant share of their outstanding sovereign bonds. This implies a diminishing stock of safe assets left for private investors, pushing up bond prices and lowering U.S. yields (along with yields in many other industrial countries). * **Still better than the rest**. Although yields on U.S. Treasuries have been falling, they are still a cut above what you might earn elsewhere. German and Japanese 10-year yields are only 0.3 percent. When looked at from this perspective, and adjusting for sovereign risk, even the shrinking returns on U.S. government bonds do not look too bad. * **The strong dollar**. The recent stellar [U.S. growth performance is diverging from much of the rest of the world. It is not surprising, then, that investors would expect the dollar to continue to strengthen in the months ahead. Indeed, Secretary Lew recently reinforced that view by saying 'I have been consistent in saying, as my predecessors have said, that a strong dollar is good for the United States.'\u009d The yield differential mentioned above combined with the expected appreciation should mean continued flows into U.S. dollar assets which, in turn, will put downward pressure on the whole U.S. yield curve.** ** **Risk yes, conundrum no** Some have argued that the falling long-term rates are set to thwart the Fed's ability to control financial conditions and guide the economy to full employment and stable prices'a so-called 'Yellen conundrum.'\u009d We don't buy this. Far from being a conundrum, having long-term rates at relatively low levels may actually give the Fed _more_ degrees of freedom. The Fed can steadily raise policy rates and, even if long-term rates remain lower than expected, this will still act as a brake on the economy through the effects on the exchange rate, interest rates on credit cards and floating rate loans, or equity prices. However, at the same time, if long-term rates stay lower this will help support the housing sector, the largest piece that has yet to fall into place in the jigsaw of the U.S. recovery. If inflation pressures were to become more prominent'which we currently see as unlikely'the yield curve should steepen automatically to act as an additional countervailing force. If somehow Treasury yields remain unusually low, though, the Fed could easily raise policy rates at a faster pace, returning to neutral on a more accelerated timetable. Doing so would have the added benefit of helping to mitigate potential financial stability risks that arise from ultra- low policy rates. Rather than being concerned right now about a possible monetary policy conundrum, what we should be wary of, instead, is a rapid unwinding of the falling term premium. We saw this in 2013 as the Fed shifted closer toward tapering its bond purchase program and markets reacted. Long-term rates shot up 100 basis points in a matter of weeks. As a result, mortgage activity experienced a sudden stop, residential investment stalled, and the negative consequences spilled out into the global economy, particularly to emerging markets. At this point it is far from clear what may precipitate such a sharp increase in U.S. bond yields. Better data could certainly do the trick'we got a taste of that on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a [gangbuster jobs report and yields have already moved off their recent lows. Certainly continued effective communication by the Fed will be needed so as to avoid surprising the market. Even then though, we may find that the recent low Treasury rates could prove to be all too temporary. In the months ahead, we may look back on this time with hindsight as a period where long-term rates transitorily overshot their fundamentals. Rather than attaching a warning sign to the conundrum of falling yields, what we should be watching out for is the economic and financial stability fallout that could unfold if U.S. yields snap back upwards in a sudden and unexpected manner.

Egypt currently faces what may seem to be conflicting objectives. On the one hand, there's an urgent need to restore economic stability'by achieving lower budget deficits, public debt and inflation, and adequate foreign exchange reserves. At the same time, there's a long-standing need to achieve better standards of living'with more jobs, less poverty, and better health and education systems'one of the key reasons why people took to the streets in 2011. Some might think that those two goals don't go together'that the actions needed to reduce the budget and external deficits will necessarily take away from jobs and growth. But that's not true. Some of the same policies that will improve Egypt's financial situation can also help improve living standards. **A difficult starting point** A call for a fairer access to economic opportunities, especially jobs, was one of the key reasons behind the January 2011 revolution. However, the past four years of political transition have taken a toll on the economy. As a result, chronic economic problems were left unaddressed and new problems became acute. The overall fiscal deficit rose from 9.8 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2010/11 to 13.8 percent in 2013/14. As a result, general government debt'domestic and external'increased from 76.6 percent of GDP to 90.5 percent during the same period. The 2013/14 data show that reserves in the central bank fell short of covering three months worth of imports while average inflation stood at 10 percent. At 2.2 percent in 2013/14, economic growth was too low to improve vital socioeconomic indicators. Unemployment peaked at 13.4 percent, with the highest levels found among youth and women. Poverty rose to 26.3 percent the year before, with another 20 percent of the population estimated to be close to the poverty line. Of note, low growth, high unemployment and poverty in Egypt live alongside weaknesses in the structure of the economy that largely predate 2011. These stem mainly from inefficient systems of subsidies, cumbersome business regulations, low human capital, poor infrastructure, low access to finance, and poor external competitiveness. [ **Policies to raise growth and lower deficits: subsidy reform, exchange rate flexibility**** ** In 2013/14, Egypt spent over 6 percent of its GDP on fuel subsidies'more than on health or education. Ironically, fuel subsidies tend to benefit the well- off segments of the population'think owners of gas guzzling cars'more than the poor who need more social protection, and better health and school systems. Fuel subsidies also favor capital-intensive industries whereas Egypt needs more labor-intensive industries to help reduce unemployment. Moreover, they contribute to large fiscal deficits and rising public debt and, hence, economic fragility, leaving very little to spend on infrastructure. **Subsidy reform**, which is part of the economic policy package the Egyptian authorities have already started implementing last summer, can change these distortions. By increasing fuel prices, the government will be able to generate large savings. This will make room for more transfers to the vulnerable people, and more resources to improve the living conditions of the poor, together with investment in roads, schools, hospitals, and power plants. This is front and center in the authorities' agenda, and the authorities have already started designing a conditional cash transfer system, financed in part by the savings stemming from the fuel subsidies reform. Spending more on **health, education, and infrastructure** will not only help the poor and most vulnerable groups in the short term, but it could also help generate higher potential growth in the longer term. This, as research shows, is very important for job creation and better standards of living. Another key economic policy is **exchange rate flexibility**. A more flexible exchange rate can strengthen competitiveness, attract foreign investment and tourism, and support exports of new industries. These can create jobs and support long-term growth and hence, raise living standards. Against this backdrop, the recent movement of the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar is a step in the right direction. **Structural reforms are crucial** Structural measures to improve the **business environment **that can make Egypt a more attractive place for investors will be important. For instance, according to the World Bank, it takes 218 days to get a construction permit in Egypt, compared to only 29 days in the Republic of Korea. Dismantling inefficient regulations and red tape will be essential to increase investment and spur jobs. Progress in this area would also help bring the informal economic sector into the fold, with a positive impact on unemployment and standards of living at large. We have found the Egyptian authorities well aware of the urgent need for structural reforms, and current plans to issue a revised investment law, for instance, go in the right direction. A key challenge for the government is building **modern and transparent institutions** to encourage accountability and good governance, and ensure fair and transparent rules of the game. Fairness in economic policy can ensure that the gains of growth can benefit all people in the society. It can ensure evenhandedness in access to jobs and opportunities for businesses, whether people are connected or not. Also, there are steps that policymakers can take to make the **financial system** work better. For example, only 10 percent of Egyptians currently have bank accounts. Increasing the diffusion of financial services and extending more credit to small job-creating businesses could help the economy in a big way. Again, progress is happening in this area in Egypt, with the adoption of a micro-finance law which could help develop the financial sector. Finally, improving the **educational system **is of paramount importance for Egypt's long-term development. Jobs cannot be created without aligning the education system to prepare graduates for what is needed in the modern labor market. The rebalancing of spending towards health and education mandated by the constitution, if implemented efficiently, could support higher, more inclusive growth in the longer term while preserving fiscal sustainability.** ** With the right policies, Egypt's government can meet the hopes and aspirations of the Egyptian people. Steadfast implementation of reforms can help restore economic stability, and spur jobs and growth. For its part, the IMF remains committed to helping Egypt achieve better living standards.

As Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u00c4?lu recently put it: 'Now is the time to act'\u009d ' _\u00c5?imdi __uygulama zaman\u00c4?__._ There is a lot at stake. Without action, we could see the global economic supertanker continuing to be stuck in the shallow waters of sub-par growth and meager job creation. This is why we need to focus on these three 'I's'\u009d: 1. ** Implementation ' promises to keep**** ** The immediate challenge for G-20 economies is to _implement_ the ambitious commitments made at the Brisbane Summit in November. If delivered, they can add more than US$2 trillion to the global economy and create millions of new jobs over the next four years. The IMF has been asked to monitor the implementation of this growth strategy and will do so ' country by country, reform by reform. The upside is tremendous. It comes on top of the potential further boost from recent [oil price declines. And yet, the global economy faces significant downside risks as well. That is why, in spite of cheaper oil and stronger U.S. growth, the IMF in January cut its [global growth forecasts for both 2015 and 2016 (to 3.5% and 3.7%). One risk emanates from what I have called 'asynchronous monetary policy'\u009d ' normalizing monetary policy in the U.S. while most others are _increasing_ monetary stimulus. Even if this process is well-managed, it may result in excessive volatility in financial markets as investors reassess their perception of risk. A second risk is the strengthening U.S dollar. Emerging market economies are especially vulnerable because, over the past five years, many of their banks and companies have increased their borrowing in dollars. A further risk is that the Euro Area and Japan could remain trapped in a twilight zone of low growth and low inflation for a prolonged period. These 'low-low conditions'\u009d would raise the risk of recession and deflation, because they would make it even harder for many countries to reduce high unemployment and high debt. 2. ** Investment ' let's get structural**** ** This all points to the need for a more powerful policy mix. Accommodative monetary policies remain essential to support demand in many countries. And fiscal adjustment should remain as growth and job-friendly as possible. But that is not enough. We need a decisive push for _structural reforms_ in areas such as trade, education, health, social safety nets, and labor and product markets, as well as efficient infrastructure. These reforms will improve _potential_ growth prospects over the medium term and some of them will also have a positive short-term effect. In particular, I strongly support the ambitious new plan to boost quality [infrastructure investment as part of the G-20 growth agenda. We have already seen some progress. Follow- through on the European Commission's ambitious '\u00ac315bn investment plan ' including by removing regulatory obstacles that have held back investment ' should have strong payoff. New trade agreements across the Pacific and the Atlantic could also spur economic growth, after years of slowing growth in global trade. Over the past two years, trade volumes have increased by only 3 percent, well below the pre- crisis average of 7 percent. So there is plenty of scope for accelerated growth. 3. ** Inclusive growth is a must**** ** The G-20 growth strategy also stresses the need for more _inclusive_ and _sustainable_ growth. One of its key goals, for example, is to close the gender gap by 25 per cent over the next decade. This would bring more than 100 million women into the labor force, thus increasing global growth while also reducing poverty and inequality. Policymakers should take inspiration from countries such as Chile and the Netherlands. These economies have sharply increased female labor force participation through smart policies that emphasize affordable childcare, maternity leave, and workplace flexibility. The Turkish G-20 presidency's plan to put international development at the center of its agenda is also very welcome. Later this year, global policymakers will seek to establish a new set of Sustainable Development Goals ' and find ways of financing them. Building on its long-standing work in developing countries, the IMF intends to play a significant role. Action is already taken on helping countries affected by Ebola. I am pleased to report that the IMF has met its commitment to the G20 in Brisbane to provide more financing and debt relief to the three affected countries. With the support of our membership, we will provide [$100 million in debt relief ' the first multilateral institution to do so' and expect to provide additional immediate financing of $160 million (in addition to the $130 million we provided in September). And we are pushing for more funding from the international donor community. This year global leaders will also have a chance to strike a comprehensive deal to cut carbon emissions at the Paris summit in December. Eliminating energy subsidies will be key. It is encouraging to see the recent decrease in fossil fuel subsidies in countries such as Cameroon, C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Haiti, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This policy, for which the IMF has been pushing hard, is good for the environment and good for growth. **Cooperation is Key** I am also heartened by the Turkish G-20 presidency's intention to increase the traction and credibility of global economic cooperation by reaching out to a wider range of stakeholders. They include civil society representatives, research centers, trade unions, and other NGOs. This effort moves us in the direction of what I have called the 'new multilateralism'\u009d. Of course, effective global cooperation requires institutions that are efficient and representative of a changing global economy. As I have said before, I am profoundly disappointed that the U.S. did not ratify the 2010 quota and governance reforms by the end of last year. The IMF's Executive Board is now working on interim steps ' while we continue to keep our eyes on the prize of completing the 2010 reforms. It is fitting that we should gather this year in Turkey, a country that straddles East and West. Bridging G-20 aspirations and accomplishments will require decisive _uygulama._ It is time for action on the three 'I's'\u009d.

Across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), inflation expectations have also drifted down especially among countries who peg their currencies to the euro (Bulgaria, Croatia, as well as Lithuania, which adopted the euro on January 1, 2015), but also in those that target their inflation rate (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania). The recent drop in world oil prices has re-ignited the debate about good vs. bad disinflation. For the euro area, risks from low inflation have been discussed in the March 2014 [iMFdirect post. Our blog examines the causes and potential consequences of falling inflation from the perspective of EU countries outside the euro zone. [ **Disinflationary dynamics** Falling world food and energy prices, and where relevant, cuts in administered prices of energy have been an important driver of disinflation across EU countries outside the euro zone (see Chart 3). [ Furthermore, core inflation ' overall inflation excluding the volatile food and energy prices ' has also drifted down, tracing price trends in the euro area, and increasingly diverging from developments in the rest of the world (see Chart 4). This suggests possible disinflationary spillovers from the euro area to other EU countries, in light of their close trade links. [ Our recent [IMF Working Paper (Iossifov and Podpiera, 2014) confirms the dominant role of these factors (see Chart 5): * Falling world food and energy prices and related cuts in administered prices account for the largest share of the inflation decline in non-euro area EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe. * Falling euro area core inflation spills over through lower prices of imports to countries with currencies pegged to the euro and, to a smaller extent, to inflation targeters with higher foreign value-added content in domestic demand. * In contrast, the domestic economic cycle ' measured by the unemployment gap ' has had a marginal impact in the recent disinflationary episode. In addition, the nominal effective exchange rate has been proportionately more important in inflation targeters. [ **Immediate gains, but medium-term costs** With rapidly falling world oil prices, disinflation pressures are unlikely to abate any time soon. According to the latest [WEO forecasts and our estimates, headline inflation is expected to stay low through 2015 in euro peggers and remain below targets in Hungary, Poland, and Sweden. In fact, the sharp decline in oil prices since June 2014 will drag inflation lower, as the commodity price drop filters through to domestic prices. Is this good or bad for the economy? The prospect of lower cost-of-living and production costs is undoubtedly a positive development in the short-run: * Lower energy prices boost the purchasing power of households and businesses. Given the still negative output gaps throughout the region, a pick-up in demand would be a boon for domestic producers. * The lower consumer and firm outlays on goods and services would also ease the liquidity strains of debt service for heavily indebted firms and households, reducing the risk of default and the related negative effect on consumption and investment. But, low inflation/deflation raises the possibility of 'second-round'\u009d disinflationary effects in the medium-term that have proven difficult to reverse and this increases debt sustainability risks: * The prospect of falling prices could suppress domestic demand, if it prompts households and firms to revise down expectations for wages and profits and thus to cut consumption and investment. These 'second-round'\u009d disinflationary effects can trigger a self-feeding, vicious feedback loop between inflationary expectations and prices'a deflationary trap. * Persistent disinflation and particularly deflation can complicate the process of deleveraging by heavily indebted firms and households, as it increases the real debt burden. This can be further exacerbated by stagnating nominal incomes, to the extent that the loss of income is not offset by the pass-through of lower inflation via nominal interest rates to debt servicing costs. **Policymakers' predicament** Overall, the fall in oil prices will likely boost growth in the short-run. But, it poses challenges to monetary policy making, which focuses on medium- term risks. A prolonged undershooting of the inflation objective could damage central banks' credibility, which would make it much harder to escape the deflation trap. What should policy makers do? Countries that peg to the euro do not have independent monetary policies and would have to rely on the [ECB's quantitative easing (QE) policy response to persistently low inflation in the euro area. Where fiscal space allows, countries could also stimulate demand through fiscal policy. Inflation-targeting central banks strive to keep inflation close to target over the medium-term. Consequently, when faced with renewed disinflationary pressures, they should aim at bringing inflation closer to its target, by stamping out 'second-round'\u009d disinflationary effects of falling energy prices. However, this could be challenging. With policy instruments at historical lows or at the zero lower bound, further easing by inflation-targeting central banks would need to weigh the benefits of normalizing price pressures with potential concerns about the impact on financial stability and capital flows and hence exchange rates. Easing monetary policy too much may prompt capital outflows and while this may help depreciate exchange rates and raise inflation, there is always a risk that the process may go too far. This is of particular concern for countries with high share of debt in foreign currencies, which are more exposed to changing investors' risk appetite, geopolitical concerns, and global financing conditions. Fortunately, the recently announced QE by the ECB opens additional space for monetary easing by inflation-targeting central banks outside the eurozone. On balance, the greater concern at present appears to be very low inflation and the possibility of sliding into a deflationary trap than financial instability on account of capital outflows, but policymakers will need to keep a watchful eye on markets.

Filiz Unsal (version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) Economists are paying increasing attention to the link between financial inclusion'greater availability of and access to financial services'and economic development. In a [new paper, we take a closer look at exactly how financial inclusion impacts a country's economy and what policies are most effective in promoting it. The new framework developed in this paper allows us to identify barriers to financial inclusion and see how lifting these barriers might affect a country's output and level of inequality. Because the more you know about what stands in the way of financial inclusion, the better you can be at designing policies that help foster it. We found the lack of financial inclusion contributes to persistent income inequality and slower growth. **Why financial inclusion matters** Large gaps exist in worldwide access to finance. Slightly more than half of the firms (58 percent) in developing countries and only one-fifth of those in low-income countries have access to bank credit (Figure 1). Firms'particularly small and medium-sized enterprises'continue to face barriers that further impede access to finance, such as high costs, travel distance, and onerous paperwork. Limited credit, high collateral requirements, and high interest rates also hamper companies' growth. [ What this means, as detailed in our recent work (and in a [National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper), is that individuals must rely on limited savings to become entrepreneurs. Once established, their fledgling enterprises tend to depend on self-financing to meet investment needs. This, in turn, limits the overall size of the firm, the ability to innovate, and productivity. **Examining country cases** To examine how best to increase financial inclusion, we applied our framework to three low-income countries: Kenya, Mozambique, and Uganda. We also applied it to three emerging market countries: Egypt, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Here's what we found: **- Disentangling constraints to financial inclusion is crucial.** We identified pertinent constraints to financial inclusion in these countries and evaluated the policy impact of relaxing these constraints on output and inequality. We found that the impact of financial inclusion policies really depends on country-specific characteristics. For example, Uganda's output is most responsive to a relaxation of collateral requirements, which is the country's most binding constraint. By contrast, high participation costs for access to financial services are a major obstacle in Malaysia. Understanding the specific factors that hold back financial inclusion, therefore, is critical for tailoring policy advice. **- Financial inclusion doesn't necessarily bring more equality immediately.** We found that financial inclusion undoubtedly brings an increase in output, though the impact on inequality measured in relative terms (income dispersion) varies. For example, a decline in the cost of accessing financial services reduces income inequality as enterprises previously excluded from the financial system are able to obtain credit and workers receive higher wages. Relaxing collateral requirements, however, may initially increase inequality. As wealthy firms invest with less collateral to get loans, they can leverage more and increase their production and profit. As banks lower collateral requirements, however, financial inclusion eventually becomes more beneficial for relatively poorer agents, driving down inequality. **- Distributional consequences could be sharp.** The consequences of increased financial inclusion can be uneven. Our results indicate that the most effective policy for increasing access to finance' lowering the cost of participation in the financial system'benefits the poor, but wealthy firms can lose somewhat as a result of higher interest rates and wages. By contrast, we found that policies that target financial depth' such as relaxing collateral requirements'benefit productive firms. Yet such policies also can impose losses on less productive firms as well as those with low credit demand, regardless of whether financial inclusion policies are in effect. **Policy implications ** As we see in the six case studies highlighted here, there is no one-size-fits- all policy prescription for increasing financial inclusion. A key first step is to develop appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks and a supporting information environment. The government has a central role to play in dismantling obstacles to financial inclusion by introducing laws that protect property or creditor rights and ensuring that these laws are adequately enforced. It can also set standards for disclosure and transparency and promote credit information- sharing systems and collateral registries. More fundamentally, it has a role in educating and protecting consumers. Governments could also consider policies such as granting exemptions from onerous documentation requirements, allowing correspondent banking, and shifting to the use of electronic payments into bank accounts for government payments. All these would help expand firms' access to finance. By moving forward with these policy measures, governments can make big inroads into increasing financial inclusion, reducing inequality, and boosting growth. **More to come** Because of the growing recognition of the importance of financial inclusion, we are increasingly applying this framework in other emerging market and low- income countries. We have over 20 country studies completed or in progress, including Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, the Economic Community of Central African States, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Zambia.

The steep decline in global oil prices, by 55 percent since last September, has changed the economic dynamics of oil exporters in the Middle East and North Africa. Our [update of the _Regional Economic Outlook_, released yesterday, shows that these countries are now faced with large export and government revenue losses, which are expected to reach about $300 billion (21 percent of GDP) in the Gulf Cooperation Council and about $90 billion (10 percent of GDP) in other oil-exporting countries. Where prices will eventually settle is, of course, uncertain, making it hard for policymakers to gauge how much of the bane is temporary in nature and what share of it they should expect to last. In the short term, most of the oil exporters have the ability to drawdown some of their accumulated financial reserves and so mitigate the impact of lower oil prices on economic activity and growth. However, with a more constrained fiscal outlook over the next few years, oil exporting countries would need to adapt progressively to new realities. Specifically, they would need to adjust their spending gradually and advance energy subsidy reforms. This means that the [growth models of the past decade that were anchored in rising government spending may no longer be sufficient. Instead, the private sector will need to become a much more self-sufficient engine of growth and jobs. [ **New realities** The oil price decline is expected to significantly erode fiscal positions across the region, at varying speeds. Except for Kuwait, all countries in the region are expected to run fiscal deficits in 2015 (see chart). The Gulf Cooperation Council fiscal surplus (4.6 percent of GDP in 2014) is now projected to turn into a deficit of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2015'a downward swing of about 11 percent of GDP. Fortunately, most oil exporters have large buffers in the form of foreign assets. These countries are generally expected to reduce the growth of government spending this year, but in a measured way. Since the overall pace of adjustment is measured, we expect that countries will be able to avoid a very sharp negative effect on growth. We expect growth in the region's oil exporters to reach 3 percent this year, somewhat higher than last year but still nearly 1 percentage point lower than we projected last October. **Need to change course** The region's oil-exporting countries will need to re-assess medium-term spending plans and, if lower oil prices persist, they will need to gradually adjust to new realities in the global oil market. Spending will need to be better prioritized to ensure it is efficiently meeting social and economic development objectives and options for increasing non-oil revenues should be considered. Energy pricing remains an issue. The new fiscal realities facing most oil exporters make it all the more urgent to tackle the underpricing of energy products, which persists despite the fall in international oil prices. A number of countries have now started this process, and that is encouraging. Looking ahead, government spending will likely be constrained for a number of years. This means that the growth model of the last decade that was anchored in rising oil prices and government spending will no longer work. Instead, countries will need to further diversify their economies to reduce reliance on oil revenues and reorient incentives toward export-driven production of goods and services. This will require stepping up reforms, especially in areas of the business environment, governance, education, and trade integration to enable the private sector to flourish and become a much more self-sustaining engine of growth. Similarly, in many countries it will be important to enable nationals to participate more in the private sector labor market to avoid pressures on governments to play the role of employer of first and last resort'a role they will find much harder to maintain during an era of lower oil prices.

Yet, worries dominate across much of Latin America and the Caribbean today, as 2015 marks yet another year of reduced growth expectations. Regional growth is projected at just 1\u00c2? percent, about the same low rate as in 2014 and almost 1 percentage point below our [previous forecast_. _Challenging external conditions are an important drag for many countries. Still, it's not too late for some good New Year's resolutions to address domestic weaknesses and improve growth prospects. [ **Winners and losers from cheaper oil**** ** Commodity prices have continued to decline, reflecting unexpected demand weakness in several major economies, including China. The most notable mover recently has been oil, where increased supply has also played an important role in depressing prices. In this environment, our [forecast for global growth has come down again, and now stands at just 3\u00c2? percent for 2015. Prospects for U.S. growth have improved, but weaker dynamics in the euro area, China, and Japan are weighing down global activity. [ The drop in oil prices is expected to be broadly neutral for Latin America and the Caribbean at large, but has very different effects across individual countries. * Venezuela's economy will take the largest hit, and is now forecast to contract by 7 percent in 2015. Indeed, each $10 decline in oil prices worsens Venezuela's trade balance by 3\u00c2? percent of GDP, a bigger effect by far than for any other country in the region. The loss in export revenue causes mounting fiscal problems and a sharper economic downturn. * To a more moderate extent, lower oil prices are also dampening growth prospects for Bolivia(whose large exports of natural gas are linked to oil prices), Colombia, and Ecuador. In all three countries, fiscal balances will suffer from falling oil revenue, but initial positions are strong enough to weather the impact. Mexico, in turn, has protected its 2015 oil revenue through financial hedging, and the petroleum sector plays a relatively modest role in the economy, so the overall impact is limited. * The rest of the region should generally benefit from cheaper oil. The biggest beneficiaries are countries with high oil import bills, notably in Central America and the Caribbean. However, some caution is warranted, as several of these countries have been relying on subsidized oil deliveries from Venezuela under the Petrocaribe arrangement. With growing economic strains in Venezuela, its Petrocaribe support has started to diminish. For most recipients, the lower market price of oil should outweigh a potential loss of favorable financing terms from Venezuela, but some countries could face short-term cash flow pressures in the public sector. Over the longer run, persistent weakness in oil prices would also limit the potential from developing untapped hydrocarbon resources in countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. **Dimmed prospects in South America** Even if lower oil prices, on balance, do not change the near-term regional outlook much, the story doesn't stop there. South America, in particular, is facing stiff headwinds from disappointing global growth and the continued decline in the prices of metals and agricultural commodities. At the same time, it benefits little from the stronger U.S. recovery. As a consequence, exports are now expected to grow by only 1 percent on average this year. The economic challenges facing South America are even more apparent from investment, which has slowed every single year since 2010 and is forecast to decline in 2015. Beyond the impact of worsening external conditions, a variety of domestic issues are also at play: * A leading example is Brazil, where private sector confidence has remained stubbornly weak even after the election-related uncertainty dissipated. Economic activity is anemic, with output projected to expand only 0.3 percent this year. On the upside, the authorities' renewed commitment to rein in the fiscal deficit and reduce inflation should help to shore up confidence in Brazil's macroeconomic policy framework. * Growth expectations in Chile and Peru are comparatively favorable but have also been pared back further since October. In Chile, uncertainty over the impact of policy reforms seems to be weighing on investment. In the case of Peru, weak exports and investment have driven a sharp recent slowdown, though concerted policy action and new mining operations are expected to support a significant rebound this year. * Despite some easing of exchange rate pressures and a better-than-expected growth outturn in 2014, Argentina continues to struggle with large macroeconomic imbalances. We expect the economy to contract in 2015. [ **Brighter conditions up North** Mexico, in turn, is projected to grow by 3.2 percent this year'a solid prospect, though less than previously expected, as lingering sluggishness in domestic demand offsets the positive spillovers from stronger U.S. growth. On the bright side, the outlook for Central America has improved as a result of lower oil prices and the robust U.S. recovery. Remittances grew 9 percent (year-on-year) in the first three quarters of 2014 and, together with stronger exports, will continue to underpin domestic activity. Similarly, the tourism- dependent economies of the Caribbean have started to see a long-awaited recovery in tourist arrivals. **Turning to policies'\u00a6**** ** Lower oil prices will alleviate external and fiscal vulnerabilities in some countries. They also provide a great opportunity to phase out costly and poorly targeted energy subsidies, which are common across the region. In much of South America, meanwhile, the broad weakness of commodity prices has widened current account deficits further. Flexible exchange rates can help cushion this external shock. However, fiscal policy will also need to adjust to the reality that earlier forecasts for commodity revenue and output growth are no longer realistic. Beyond such adjustments, the difficult current outlook underscores the urgency of supply-side reforms outlined in our recent [_Regional Economic Outlook_ reports. Boosting growth prospects and sustaining poverty reduction in a more challenging external environment will require determined efforts to improve the business environment, raise productivity, and increase saving and investment. It's not too late yet for good New Year's resolutions.

On the one hand, major economies are benefiting from the decline in the price of [oil. On the other, in many parts of the world, lower long run prospects adversely affect demand, resulting in a strong undertow. We released the [_World Economic Outlook Update_ today in Beijing, China. The upshot for the global economy is that while we expect stronger growth in 2015 than in 2014, our forecast is slightly down from last October. More specifically, our forecast for global growth in 2015 is 3.5%, 0.3% higher than global growth in 2014, but 0.3% less than our forecast in October. For 2016, we forecast 3.7% growth, again a downward revision from the [last _World Economic Outlook._ At the country level, the cross currents make for a complicated picture. Good news for oil importers, bad news for exporters. Good news for commodity importers, bad news for exporters. Continuing struggles for the countries which still show scars of the crisis, not so for others. Good news for countries more linked to the euro and the yen, bad news for those more linked to the dollar. In short, many different combinations, many different boxes, and countries in each box. Let me expand a bit on some of these themes. The [price of oil has declined from about 100 dollars a barrel in June to less than 50 dollars today. The sudden decline appears largely due to an unexpected change in OPEC strategy, namely the decision to maintain OPEC supply in the face of steadily increasing non OPEC supply and weakening global demand. We expect the factors behind the decrease to remain relevant, and thus much but not all of the price decline to be persistent. For **oil importers**, this is good news. The price decline increases real income, decreases costs of production for firms, and both lead to more spending. The effect can potentially be large. If, for example, oil consumption is equal to 3% of GDP, a 50% drop reflects an increase in real income of 1.5%, the equivalent of a large fiscal expansion for example. It also leads to lower inflation, which, in other times could be a blessing, but in the current environment of too low inflation and central banks' policy rates close to zero, is a source of worry. On net however, we have little doubt that, for oil importers, the effect is strongly positive. For **oil exporters**, and for firms involved in new forms of energy production, this is clearly bad news. To the extent that the price decrease is persistent, oil exporters will have to reduce their level of government spending. Those who have substantial buffers, or those that have flexible exchange rates, can adjust more slowly. Others may need to do more dramatic adjustments. In that context, the adverse effects on Russia and Nigeria are likely to be very large. Some energy firms may also face financial risks. Systemic risks, either from country or corporate defaults, however appear limited. **Another important development is the movement in exchange rates**. Since August, the dollar has appreciated in real terms by 7%, the euro has depreciated by 3%, and the yen by 10%. While the dollar appreciation may slow down the US recovery, it must be seen as a welcome adjustment. It will boost demand in two large economies, the euro area and Japan, and maybe help them out of their slump. Unfortunately, these positive developments are offset by bad news on a number of fronts. One of the major disappointments of 2014 was the low growth in Japan. Sustained growth in Japan requires two conditions: more private demand in the short run, and higher potential growth in the medium run. Both private domestic and foreign demand have disappointed recently, and the structural reform impetus still seems too weak to raise expectations about future growth and spur investment. More generally, **our assessment of the underlying growth potential in many countries has been revised down**. Reasons vary. The effects of the decline in commodity prices which started in 2011 on [Latin America's growth prospects are becoming clearer. The same is true of sub Saharan Africa. [Russia is suffering from a combination of ills, from uncertainty and a poor investment climate, to sanctions, to lower oil prices. In [China, on the other hand, the gradual decrease in growth to below 7% in 2015 reflects a welcome decision to reorient the economy towards consumption and away from the real estate sector and shadow banking. This lower growth however is in turn affecting the rest of Asia. Where does this leave us? Looking at **advanced countries**, our forecasts reflect the increasing divergence between the United States on the one hand, and the Euro area and Japan on the other. For 2015, we have revised US growth up to 3.6%, Euro area growth down to 1.2%, Japan growth down to 0.6%. Some of our largest downward revisions are in **emerging markets**, notably in Sub- Saharan Africa, the economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Latin America. They were smaller in Emerging Asia, where growth is still very high, particularly in its leading economies like India and China. As always, there are **risks to the forecasts**. The most obvious downside risks involve stagnation in the Euro area and in Japan. In both, using the three arrows (borrowing the expression from Abenomics), monetary policy, fiscal policy, and structural policies, continues to be of the essence. Risks of another episode of turmoil associated with the increase in short rates in the United States are present, but limited. Some corporates in emerging market indebted in dollars could also prove vulnerable to the additional pressures from a strong dollar and weak earnings from low commodity prices. Let me end however on a more positive note. Assessing the favorable effects of the decline in the price of oil in the current environment is difficult. This decline may turn out to be a stronger 'shot in the arm'\u009d than is implicit in our forecasts. In other words, when we meet again in the spring, our forecasts may turn out to have been a bit too pessimistic. I very much hope so.

[ The fall is good news but it is too soon to say 'mission accomplished.'\u009d Among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the average jobless rate is still well above the pre-recession level, in sharp contrast to that in non-member countries (chart 1, right panel). Moreover, a new [Global Jobs Index shows that global employment growth remains sluggish at about 1.5% a year, considerably lower than the annual rates of 2-2 \u00c2? percent employment growth that prevailed before the crisis (chart 2). The index makes quarterly estimates of employment levels in 64 large economies and aggregates them into a global total. The countries covered represent about 95% of global GDP and 80% of the global labor force. For countries where quarterly employment data are not available, the employment levels are derived by estimating historical relationships between jobs and growth. [ The index does show that global employment has grown by about 9 percent'which translates into 208 million jobs being created'since the low point of the recession. So things have gotten better, but the pace of job creation has not returned to what prevailed before the crisis. The index can be used to take the pulse of global labor markets at more regular intervals than has been done before. While financial markets are monitored second-by-second, data on jobs'which matters more to most people'are often not available every quarter because many countries do not report employment numbers in a timely manner.** ** **Jobs and growth: can't have one without the other** The construction of the index gets around a problem'the lack of timely employment data'by relying on the fact that job creation generally [tracks overall growth in the economy. For both OECD and non- OECD countries, the relationship between jobs and growth has held up well over the Great Recession. The left panel of chart 3 shows the strong link between employment and output growth during the Great Recession years from 2008 through 2010. In countries where the economy grew ( such as Singapore, Israel and Australia, shown in the northeast quadrant), employment grew as well. Where output declined (such as in Spain and Ireland, shown in the southwest quadrant), employment fell as well. [ A similar relationship has prevailed during the uneven global recovery from 2011 through today. Countries where growth has recovered have seen employment increase as well. The U.S. economy, for example, grew at an annual rate of nearly 5% in the two middle quarters of 2014, its fastest six-month pace in more than a decade. As a consequence, U.S. employers hired nearly 3 million additional workers in 2014, the most in 15 years. In some European countries, real GDP continued to fall during 2010-14 and employment did as well. As a consequence, unemployment there remains alarmingly high'around 25% in Greece and Spain, more than 14% in Portugal and 11.5% in the euro area as a whole. The youth unemployment rate stood at an unprecedented rate of 23 percent in the euro area in mid-2014.** ** **More work to do** It is too soon to say if the global economy is settling into a slower pace of employment growth. Certainly, very weak jobs growth in the European Union, which represents nearly 25% of global GDP, is a factor. So too is slower economic growth in China, where the pace of GDP expansion has slowed from more than 10% in the middle of the last decade ago to around 7% now'indeed the slower rate of growth in China is one of the main reasons for the weakening of the Global Jobs Index in the last 18 months.** ** Countries need a mix of policies to stimulate both aggregate demand and supply to raise employment growth, as discussed in an earlier [post. Broadly speaking, in advanced economies, monetary policy should continue to support the recovery in demand and policies to reduce public debt must be as growth-friendly as possible. Emerging markets, where growth is slowing from pre-crisis rates, need to primarily address underlying structural problems, which vary from removing bottlenecks in the power sector to reforms of labor and product markets. In many countries, there is a strong case for increasing public investment in infrastructure, which would provide a boost to demand in the short term and to supply (i.e. potential output) over the longer term. In short, the fall in global unemployment is welcome news, but there is more to do to boost growth, which in turn will help absorb the expanding global labor force into jobs.

During booms, conditions such as lax lending standards and low interest rates help drive up house prices and with them mortgage debt. When the bust arrives, over-indebted households find themselves underwater on their mortgages' owing more than their homes are worth. Feeling the pinch of reduced wealth and access to credit, households, in turn, rein in consumption. At the same time, lower house prices cause investment in new houses to tumble. Together, these forces significantly depress output and increase unemployment. Non-performing loans increase, and banks respond by tightening credit and lending standards, further depressing house prices and adding to the vicious cycle. **_Avoiding boom-bust cycles_** But just because boom-bust cycles are nothing new doesn't mean that they can't be avoided, or their effects mitigated. To better understand how policies can promote recovery from such cycles and avoid their recurrence, IMF economists recently completed a [new analysis examining the experiences of four European countries'Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain'that suffered real house price declines of 25 percent or more in recent years. Prices are now rising in Denmark and Ireland, and have begun to stabilize in the Netherlands and likely also in Spain. Nonetheless, these countries are still addressing the legacy of the boom-bust cycle, including significant output gaps'the difference between an economy's actual level of output and its potential'and private-sector debt overhangs, with household debt-to-income ratios ranging from around 125 percent in Spain to about 300 percent in Denmark (see chart).** ** [ **_Addressing the legacy of the crisis_**** ** Closing output gaps and reducing private-sector debt overhang is no easy task, in part due to difficult trade-offs. For example, if many households cut their consumption and increase their savings to pay down their debt more quickly, this will come at the cost of further depressing output and widening the output gap. A key policy objective should thus be to encourage household debt reduction in ways that minimize the drag on growth. Supportive economic policies are a first line of defense. For instance, the European Central Bank's monetary easing during the crisis'along with the preponderance of adjustable-rate mortgages in countries like Denmark, Ireland, and Spain'has helped boost nominal incomes and ease debt-servicing costs by lowering interest rates and boosting growth. Faster nominal income growth makes deleveraging less costly because it allows debt-to-income ratios to adjust more through the denominator (nominal income) than the numerator (cutting spending to reduce nominal debt). Another approach is to help households access assets that can be used to pay down debt. For instance, the Netherlands adopted temporary tax exemptions that made it easier for parents to help their children pay down mortgage debt. Reforms that allow first-time home-buyers to access their pension savings to finance homes without incurring a penalty have also been used in the United States and Switzerland. Effective debt restructuring frameworks are also essential to facilitate more rapid adjustment and economic recovery. While countries need to take their specific circumstances into account, a number of measures can help, including: * regulatory and supervisory incentives to encourage banks to make use of existing resolution frameworks, such as in Ireland where banks must meet targets for offering and concluding sustainable solutions to mortgage arrears; * establishing effective insolvency frameworks, for instance by promoting less-costly out-of-court workouts; and, * fiscal incentives, such as easing the taxation of debt relief granted to highly indebted borrowers. Finally, well-capitalized and provisioned banks are needed to help overcome debt distress episodes. Countries such as Ireland and Spain have benefited from forced recapitalization of banks, following asset-quality reviews and stress tests. Limits on the percent of profits that banks can pay out in dividends have also encouraged banks to repair their balance sheets by boosting capital rather than cutting back excessively on lending. **_Lessons for the future_** What can be done to reduce the number and severity of housing crises going forward? * First, remove incentives for excessive debt accumulation by, for instance, gradually reducing the income tax deductibility of mortgage interest. Updating house valuations is also key to ensure property tax payments reflect current valuations, as this avoids subsidizing housing (and thus mortgage debt) and helps lean against the cycle. * Second, trim distortions in the rental market. This includes progressively reducing rent controls and providing more flexibility in lease contracts, as Spain did in 2013. Such measures can make rental housing more available, thereby reducing the need for households to take on mortgage debt and lessening the economy's vulnerability to house price cycles. * Third, use prudential tools to lean against the cycle and avoid excessive debt accumulation. For example, limits on debt-to-income ratios can make it more difficult for borrowers to take on ever-larger mortgages as house prices rise.** ** While housing crises'just like other crises'are bound to occur, recent experience suggests that countries can take a number of measures early on to mitigate their impact and reduce the likelihood of future crises. Countries have made progress in this regard, but they should continue to look at available options to strengthen their resilience and prospects going forward, while always taking their specific circumstances into account. An ounce of prevention can help avoid the need for a pound of cure.

Overall, we see this as a shot in the arm for the global economy. Bearing in mind that our simulations do not represent a forecast of the state of the global economy, we find __a gain for world GDP between 0.3 and 0.7 percent in 2015, compared to a scenario without the drop in oil prices. There is however much more to this complex and evolving story. In this blog we examine the mechanics of the oil market now and in the future, the implications for various groups of countries as well as for financial stability, and how policymakers should address the impact on their economies. __ _ _In summary:__ _ * _We find both supply and demand factors have played a role in the sharp price decline since June. Futures markets suggest that oil prices will rebound but remain below the level of recent years. There is however substantial uncertainty about the evolution of supply and demand factors as the story unfolds._ * _While no two countries will experience the drop in the same way, they share some common traits: oil importers among advanced economies, and even more so emerging markets, stand to benefit from higher household income, lower input costs, and improved external positions. Oil exporters will take in less revenue, and their budgets and external balances will be under pressure._ * _Risks to financial stability have increased, but remain limited. Currency pressures have so far been limited to a handful of oil exporting countries such as Russia, Nigeria, and Venezuela. Given global financial linkages, these developments demand increased vigilance all around._ * _Oil exporters will want to smooth out the adjustment by not curtailing fiscal spending abruptly. For those without savings funds and strong fiscal rules, budgetary and exchange rate pressures may, however, be significant. Without the right monetary policies, this could lead to higher inflation and further depreciation.__ _ * _The fall in oil prices provides an opportunity for many countries to decrease energy subsidies and use the savings toward more targeted transfers, and for some to increase energy taxes and lower other taxes. _ * _In the euro area and Japan, where demand is weak and conventional monetary policy has done most of what it can, central banks forward guidance is crucial to anchor medium term inflation expectations in the face of falling oil prices. _ _Again, our simulations of the impact of the oil price drop do not represent a forecast for the state of the world economy in 2015 and beyond. This we will do in the IMF's next **World Economic Outlook** in January, where we will also look at many other cross-currents driving growth, inflation, global imbalances and financial stability.__ _ **What follows is our attempt to answer seven key questions about the oil price decline**: 1. What are the respective roles of demand and supply factors? 2. How persistent is this supply shift likely to be? 3. What are the effects likely to be on the global economy? 4. What are likely to be the effects on oil importers? 5. What are likely to be the effects on oil exporters? 6. What are the financial implications? 7. What should be the policy response of oil importers and exporters? #### What are the respective roles of demand and supply factors? Oil prices have fallen by nearly 50 percent since June, 40 percent since September (see Chart 1).[2] Metal prices, which typically react to global activity even more than oil prices, have also decreased but substantially less so than oil (see Chart 2). This casual observation suggests that factors specific to the oil market, especially supply ones, could have played an important role in explaining the drop in oil prices. [ A closer look reinforces this conclusion. Revisions between June and December of International Energy Agency forecasts of demand (see Chart 3), combined with estimates of the short run elasticity of oil supply, suggest that unexpected lower demand between then and now can account for only 20 to 35 percent of the price decline. [ On the supply side, the evidence points to a number of factors, including surprise increases in oil production. This is in part due to faster than expected recovery of Libyan oil production in September and unaffected Iraq production, despite unrest.[3] A major factor, however, is surely the publicly announced intention of Saudi Arabia'the biggest oil producer within OPEC'not to counter the steadily increasing supply of oil from both other OPEC and non-OPEC producers, and the subsequent November decision by OPEC to maintain their collective production ceiling of _30 million barrels_ a day in spite of a perceived glut. The steady increase in global oil production could be seen as 'the dog that didn't bark.'\u009d In other words, oil prices had stayed relatively high in spite of the upward trajectory in global oil production due to the perception at the time of OPEC's induced floor price. The resulting shift by the swing producer however helped trigger a fundamental change in expectations about the future path of global oil supply, in turn explaining both the timing and magnitude of the fall in oil prices, bringing the latter closer to the level of a competitive market equilibrium. A similarly dramatic drop took place in 1986, when Saudi Arabia voluntarily stopped being the swing producer, causing oil prices to fall from $27 to $14 per barrel, only to recover fifteen years later, in 2000. Beyond traditional demand and supply factors, some have pointed to 'financialization'\u009d'oil and other commodities considered by financial investors as a distinct asset class'and 'speculation'\u009d as contributors to the price decline.[4] We see little evidence that this is the case. According to the latest report from the International Energy Agency, oil inventories have reached their highest level in two years, suggesting expectations of price increases, not price declines. #### How persistent is this supply shift likely to be? This depends primarily on **two factors**: The first is whether OPEC, and in particular Saudi Arabia, will be willing to cut production in the future. This in turn depends in part on the motives behind its change in strategy, and the relative importance of geopolitical and economic factors in that decision. One hypothesis is that Saudi Arabia has found it too costly, in the face of steady increases in non-OPEC supply, to be the swing producer and maintain a high price. If so, and unless the pain of lower revenues leads other OPEC producers and Russia to agree to share cuts more widely in the future, the shift in strategy is unlikely to change soon. Another hypothesis is that it may be an attempt by OPEC to reduce profits, investment, and eventually supply by non-OPEC suppliers, some of whom face much higher costs of extraction than the main OPEC producers (see Chart 4, which gives the world marginal cost curve, showing how much it costs to produce an additional barrel by type of oil extraction). [ The second factor is how investment and in turn oil production will respond to low oil prices. There is some evidence that capital expenditure on oil production has started to fall. According to Rystad Energy, overall capital expenditure of major oil companies is 7 percent lower for the third quarter of 2014 compared to 2013. Available projections from the same source indicate that capital expenditures will fall markedly throughout 2017. For unconventional oil, such as shale, (which now accounts for 4 million out of a world supply of 93 million barrels a day), the break-even prices'the oil price at which it becomes worthwhile to extract'of the main United States shale fields (Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian) are typically below $60 per barrel (see Chart 5 which gives break- even prices for the United States shale fields). At current prices (around $55 per barrel), Rystad Energy's projections suggest that the level of oil production could decline but only moderately by about less than 4 percent in 2015. Rates of return will be significantly lower, however, and some highly leveraged firms that did not hedge against lower prices are already under financial stress and have been cutting their capital expenditure and laying off significantly. [ Thus, other things being equal, the dynamic effects of low prices on supply should lead to a decrease in supply relative to the initial shift and thus to a partial recovery of prices. This is what is suggested by futures markets, which show, in the left hand side panel of Chart 6, an expected recovery of prices to $73 a barrel by 2019. The uncertainty associated with these forecasts comes not only from supply but also demand factors. On the supply side, for example, possible changes in OPEC's strategy and geopolitical tensions in Libya, Iraq, Ukraine, and Russia should not be underestimated. On the demand side, uncertainty about global economic activity and thus the derived demand for oil remains high. This is shown, emphatically, by the size of the implied distribution of futures prices (based on options prices) in the right hand side panel of Chart 6: the 68% confidence band for the price in 2019 ranges from $48 to $85, the 95 percent band from $38 to $115; a very wide range indeed.** ** [ #### What are the effects likely to be on the global economy? Overall, lower oil prices due to supply shifts are good news for the global economy, obviously with major distribution effects between oil importers and oil exporters. The crucial assumptions in quantifying the effects of those supply shifts are how large and persistent we expect them to be. These assumptions determine not only the path of adjustment, but also the initial reaction of consumers and firms. Given the uncertainty about the relative importance of supply shifts, both now and expected in the future, we present the results of two simulations (these are ceteris paribus in nature'not projections about the global economy, and as such ignoring all other shocks likely to affect the global economy), which we see as representing a reasonable range of assumptions. The first assumes that the supply shift accounts for 60 percent of the price decline reflected in futures markets. The second also assumes that the supply shift accounts for 60 percent of the price decline at the start but that the shift is partly undone over time for the reasons described above, with its contribution to the price decline going gradually to zero in 2019.[5] The results of the simulations shown below capture only the effects of the supply component of the oil price decline (the demand driven component of the oil price decline is a symptom of slowing global economic activity rather than a cause). The oil price projection used in the simulations is based on the IMF's price forecast, which is itself based on futures contracts. The results for global GDP are shown in Chart 7. The first simulation implies an increase in global output of 0.7 percent in 2015 and 0.8 percent in 2016 relative to the baseline (the situation without the oil price drop. Not surprisingly, in the second scenario, the effect on output is smaller, of the order of 0.3 percent in 2015 and 0.4 percent in 2016. The range of these effects includes predictions which would be obtained using existing empirical estimates for advanced economies. Estimates from Blanchard and Gali (2009) for example find that the effect of a permanent (supply driven) decrease in the price of oil by 10 percent leads to an increase in U.S. output by about 0.2 percent.[6] Given a supply component of the price decline of about 25% (60% of a total decline of 40%), these estimates would therefore imply an increase in output of about 0.5%. These global results mask asymmetric effects from lower prices across countries. Winners are the (net) oil importing countries, losers are (net) oil exporting countries. But, even within each group, there are important differences. _ _ #### What are likely to be the effects on oil importers? There are three main channels through which a decrease in the price of oil affects oil importers. The first is the effect of the increase in real income on consumption. The second is the decrease in the cost of production of final goods, and in turn on profit and investment. The third is the effect on the rate of inflation, both headline and core. The strength of these effects varies across countries: For example, the real income effect is smaller for the United States, which now produces over half of the oil it consumes, than for the euro zone or for Japan. The real income and profit effects also depend on the energy intensity of the country: China and India remain substantially more energy intensive than advanced economies, and thus benefit more from lower energy prices. The share of oil consumption in GDP is on average 3.8 percent for the United States, compared to 5.4 percent for China and 7.5 percent for India and Indonesia.[7] The effect on core inflation depends both on the direct effect of lower oil prices on headline inflation, and on the passthrough of oil prices to wages and other prices. The strength of the passthrough depends on real wage rigidities'the way nominal wages respond to CPI inflation'and the anchoring of inflation expectations. In normal times, monetary policy would respond to lower core inflation through a more than one-for-one decrease in the nominal interest rate, and thus a lower real interest rate. However, times are not normal, and the major advanced economies are constrained by interest rates at zero, leaving aside quantitative easing. While the United States, which is getting closer to exiting this zero lower bound, can respond to a decrease in inflation by delaying the timing of its exit, the euro zone and Japan, which are expected to remain at the zero lower bound for a long time, cannot materially change their conventional monetary policy. Our simulations reflect, to the best possible extent, these differences in energy intensity, in the proportion of oil produced at home, and in monetary policy constraints. We assume that inflation expectations are similarly anchored in the United States, the euro zone, and Japan, leading to a pass through of about 0.2, so a decrease in core inflation of 0.2 percentage points when headline inflation decreases by 1 percentage point. The implications for GDP are shown in Chart 8 for the two simulations described earlier. The effect on China in both scenarios are larger than those for Japan, the United States and euro zone countries. For China, GDP increases 0.4-0.7 percent above the baseline in 2015, and 0.5-0.9 percent in 2016. For the United States, GDP increases 0.2-0.5 percent above the baseline in 2015, by 0.3-0.6 percent in 2016. (The simulation assumptions do not take into account the potential offset from some policies that governments may implement following the fall in oil prices. For example, China may decide to tighten monetary or fiscal policy in response to the oil price decline). Other effects are relevant, which our simulations do not take into account. Among them: The depreciation of the yen and the euro since June (by 14 percent and 8 percent respectively, for reasons mostly unrelated to the decline in the price of oil), imply that the decrease in the price of oil in terms of yen and euros has been smaller than in dollars, namely 36 percent and 40 percent respectively. Those depreciations somewhat mute the impact of the oil price slump for Japan and the euro zone compared to our simulations. In countries which have large specific'as opposed to proportional'taxes on energy (that is, they levy a fixed dollar or euro amount per gallon or liter), the same percentage decrease in the world price of oil leads to a smaller percentage decrease in the price paid by consumers and firms. Countries may also use the opportunity of a decreasing price of oil to reduce energy subsidies'a move that has been generally recommended by the IMF'leading again to a smaller decline in the price paid by consumers and firms. Some oil importers depend heavily on what happens to oil exporters, and thus may benefit less from lower oil prices. For example, low-income importers in the Caribbean that benefit from transfers under Venezuela's Petrocaribe regime could face a marked reduction in transfers as Venezuela itself comes under pressure. Caucasus and central Asia oil importers are likely to experience adverse spillovers from slowing growth in their oil exporting neighbors, particularly Russia, which will reduce non-oil exports and remittances. Mashreq countries and Pakistan might also be adversely affected through a decline in non-oil exports, official transfers and remittances from the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, especially over the medium term. #### What are likely to be the effects on oil exporters? As Chart 8 shows, the effect is, not surprisingly, negative for oil exporters. Here again, however, there are substantial differences across countries. In all countries, real income goes down, and so do profits in oil production; these are the mirror images of what happens in oil importers. But the degree to which they do, and the effect of the decline in the price of oil on GDP depends very much on their degree of dependence on oil exports, and on what proportion of revenues goes to the state. Oil exports are much more concentrated across countries than oil imports. Put another way, oil exporters depend much more on oil than oil importers. To take some examples, energy accounts for 25 percent of Russia's GDP, 70 percent of its exports, and 50 percent of federal revenues. In the Middle East, the share of oil in federal government revenue is 22.5 percent of GDP and 63.6 percent of exports for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. In Africa, oil exports accounts for 40-50 percent of GDP for Gabon, Angola and the Republic of Congo, and 80 percent of GDP for Equatorial Guinea. Oil also accounts for 75 percent of government revenues in Angola, Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea. In Latin America, oil contributes respectively about 30 percent and 46.6 percent to public sector revenues, and about 55 percent and 94 percent of exports for Ecuador and Venezuela.[8] This shows the dimension of the challenge facing these countries. In most countries, a mechanical effect of the oil price decline is likely to be a fiscal deficit. One way to illustrate the vulnerabilities of oil- exporting countries is to compute the so-called _fiscal break-even prices'that is, the oil prices_ at which the governments of _oil_-exporting countries balance their budgets. The breakeven prices vary considerably across countries, but they are often very high.[9] For Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, the break-even prices range from $54 per barrel for Kuwait to $184 for Libya with a notable $106 for Saudi Arabia (see Chart 9). For countries for which we do not have available data on break-even prices, budgetary oil prices (that is, the oil prices that countries assume in preparing their budget) are another way to gauge countries' vulnerability to falling oil prices. [ For Africa, those budgetary oil prices have been revised down in 2015 in light of the falling prices (See Chart 10). For Latin America, the budgetary oil prices are $79.7 for Ecuador and $60 for Venezuela. [ Some countries are better equipped than in previous episodes to manage the adjustment. A few have put in place policy cushions such as fiscal rules and saving funds and have more credible monetary framework, which have helped decouple internal from external balances, such as Norway. But, in many, the adjustment will imply fiscal tightening, lower output, and a depreciation (harder to achieve under the fixed exchange rate regimes that characterize many oil exporters). And where expectations of inflation are not well anchored, the depreciation may lead to higher inflation. #### What are the financial implications? Declines in oil prices have financial implications, directly through the effects of oil prices themselves, and indirectly through the induced adjustment of exchange rates. Lower oil prices weaken the financial position of firms in the energy sector, especially those that have borrowed in dollars, and by implication weaken the position of banks and other institutions with substantial claims on the energy sector. The proportion of energy firms with an interest coverage ratio (the ratio of cash flows to interest payments) below 2 stands at 31 percent in emerging countries, indicating that some of these companies may indeed be at risk. CEMBI spreads, which reflect spreads on high yield emerging market corporates, have increased by 100 basis points since June. Stress tests carried out in the context of our financial stability assessments over the past few years in a number of oil exporting countries had found only a few countries where some banks did not pass the tests, implying recapitalization needs of a few points of GDP at most. However, those stress tests results may not be very informative since the capital buffers at the time of the tests may have changed, as well as the profitability of banks. Russia is a good example of rapidly evolving conditions in both respects considering the effect of sanctions on its financial sector. Overall the impact of lower oil prices on banks in oil-exporting countries will depend critically on how persistent the fall in price is and its impact on economic activity and in turn on prevailing buffers. Lower oil prices also typically lead to an appreciation of oil importers' currencies, in particular the dollar, and to a depreciation of oil exporters' currencies. The drop in oil price has contributed to an abrupt depreciation of currencies in a number of oil exporting countries including Russia and Nigeria. While the decrease in the price of oil is only one of the reasons behind the fall of the rouble, the Russian currency has depreciated by 40 percent so far this year, and 56 percent since September. While controlled depreciations can help oil exporters adjust, they also exacerbate financial problems for those firms and governments whose debt is denominated in dollars. And, in countries where expectations are not well anchored, uncontrolled depreciations can lead quickly to very high inflation. If sustained, the oil price slump will thus have a concentrated and material impact on those bondholders and banks with high dollar and energy sector exposures. However, the global banking system's exposure is likely not to be large enough to cause more than a moderate increase in provisioning requirements and should be partially offset by improving credit quality in oil importing countries and sectors. Some oil importers may nevertheless have financial sector linkages to oil exporters, and may be exposed to economic and financial developments in the latter. For example, Austrian banks have significant exposure to Russia, and some have seen a very sharp decline in their equity price recently. This relatively optimistic assessment must however come with a clear warning. One of the lessons from the Great Financial Crisis is that large changes in prices and exchange rates, and the implied increased uncertainty about the position of some firms and some countries can lead to increases in global risk aversion, with major implications for repricing of risk, and for shifts in capital flows. This is all the more true when combined with other developments such as what is happening in Russia. One cannot completely dismiss this tail risk. #### What should be the policy response of oil importers and exporters? Clearly, the appropriate policy response to falling oil prices will depend on whether the country is an oil importer or exporter. The exception is the shared opportunity provided by low oil prices to reform energy subsidies and energy taxes. The IMF has long advocated that governments use the saving from the removal of energy subsidies toward more targeted transfers.[10] Low prices provide a great opportunity to remove subsidies at less political cost. For example, India was able to decrease diesel subsidies recently, and there were no protests as the price did not rise. And, in a number of advanced countries, this might be an opportunity to increase energy taxes, using the savings to reduce other taxes, such as labor taxes. Now let's turn to oil importing countries. In normal times, for a country in good macroeconomic health ' say, no output gap, inflation is at target and current account is balanced' the advice is well honed, learned from past movements in oil prices: monetary policy should make sure that, in the face of lower headline inflation, inflation expectations remain anchored, and try to maintain stable core inflation. Whether this implies an increase or a decrease in the interest rate is ambiguous. On the one hand, higher demand calls for higher interest rates; on the other hand, keeping core inflation from declining, may call for lowering interest rates. In general, whatever the interest rate does, the improvement in the current account balance is likely to generate an exchange rate appreciation. This appreciation is natural, and desirable. Times are not normal however. Most large advanced economies suffer from a substantial output gap, inflation below target, and conventional monetary policy constrained by interest rates close to zero. This suggests that any increase in demand is welcome at this stage, and that lower inflation, which cannot be offset by lower interest rates, is more dangerous. Against this backdrop, use of forward guidance to anchor medium run inflation expectations and avoid sustained deflation is crucial. One might think that the appropriate policy response for oil exporters is the same as that of oil importers, but sign reversed. Importers differ however from exporters in two important ways: first, the size of the shock faced by oil exporters as a proportion of their economy is much larger than for oil importers. Second, the contribution of oil revenues to fiscal revenues is typically much higher. Thus, in all countries, lower fiscal revenues, and the risk that prices remain low for some time, imply the need for some decrease in government spending. In countries that have accumulated substantial funds from past higher prices, allowing for larger fiscal deficits and drawing on those funds for some time is appropriate. This is even more so for exporters with fixed exchange rates, and where the real depreciation needed for adjustment may take some time to achieve. For countries without such fiscal space, and where room to increase the fiscal deficit is limited, the adjustment will be tougher. Those countries need a larger real depreciation. And they need a strong monetary framework to avoid that depreciation leads to persistently higher inflation and further depreciation. This will indeed be a challenge for a few oil exporters.

In this context, it is not surprising that the impact of IMF-supported programs on public health spending has generated considerable attention. Previous research, focusing on periods before the global financial crisis, indicates that Fund-supported [programs have a [positive effect on [public health spending (Martin and Segura, 2004; Center for Global Development, 2007; Clements, Gupta and Nozaki, 2013). But does this pattern still hold if we extend the analysis to more recent years? In this blog, we take a fresh look at this evidence for developing economies. Based on our assessment of developments over 2003 to 2012, we find that the broad patterns identified in our earlier peer reviewed empirical analysis still hold, with spending rising at a brisker pace in countries with Fund- supported programs than those without (Figure 1). For example, we find that health spending has been rising, as a share of GDP, at a faster annual pace in countries with Fund-supported programs. This is especially the case for low- income countries (which pay zero interest under Fund-supported programs), as well as those of Sub-Saharan Africa. Over a 10 year period, the cumulative difference between program and non-program low-income countries is substantial'about 0.6 percentage points of GDP. Our 2013 econometric analysis indicates that if we control for macroeconomic factors that affect health spending, the impact almost doubles. We get the same picture of the effect of Fund-supported programs if we focus on other measures of spending increases. For example, real health spending per person grew by an average of about 6\u00c2? percent a year in low-income countries with programs; those without programs, in contrast, averaged spending increases of 4\u00c2? percent. When we look at developments between the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2012, we have a similar story. Countries adversely affected by the Ebola virus also show greater spending increases (as a percent of GDP) during periods with Fund-supported programs, with Guinea increasing by 0.7 percentage points, Liberia by 1.6, and Sierra Leone by 0.24 points (from 2010 to 2013). Why do Fund-supported programs have a positive effect on health spending? As suggested in our earlier work, one reason is the emphasis in these programs on tax reforms that raise revenues, which can help countries increase social spending in a fiscally sustainable manner. Furthermore, to the extent that programs lead to higher economic growth, IMF-supported programs can help generate the fiscal space (including through more robust revenue growth) to finance these outlays. Another channel is the catalytic effect of IMF- supported programs on donor financing, which can also deepen the pool of resources to finance priority spending on both health and other programs. More recently, the incorporation of minimum floors on social spending in Fund- supported programs has also encouraged countries to raise health spending. The IMF's [Independent Evaluation Office found that 29 of 30 recent programs incorporated these minimum floors (IEO, 2014). In sum, recent evidence continues to suggest that Fund-supported programs are compatible with country plans to expand public spending on health. Raising health spending, of course, is just one piece of the puzzle for achieving better health outcomes. In particular, countries should also focus on [reforms that improve the efficiency of this spending, where there is significant room for improvement (Coady, Francese, and Shang, 2014).

These fast growing, low-income countries have their own story, and it's not what you might think. In May of this year, I wrote about [who they are and how they are different, and now I want to go into a bit more detail about how their economies have been on the rise and how they have moved themselves to the frontier. **Not your grandfather's growth story** Although the countries' economic paths vary like snowflakes' no two are the same'their growth stories have two distinct features. First, frontier economies like Bangladesh, Tanzania, and Mozambique, to name just a few, have a different growth story from the United States or China because they are not growing by moving their economy from agriculture, to manufacturing, then to services: they are growing across all of them, as you can see in this chart: [ Second, despite this different growth path, frontier economies have made progress when you compare their economic size relative to an advanced economy like the United States'a process known as convergence. This is due in large part to more stable and predictable fiscal and monetary policies, strong investment and exports, better debt management, less red tape, stronger institutions, strong productivity gains, and access to capital markets. **The next chapter**** ** Looking ahead, a number of factors will help these economies continue to achieve strong growth. They will reap the benefits of a large, young, working- age population for years to come. They are well endowed with natural resources. They are making inroads in global ties. They have a growing middle class, which creates potential for new markets. All well and good, you're thinking, but weak global demand, tumbling oil prices and the expected end to the unconventional monetary policies in the United States could pose risks for frontier economies. All true. Indeed, many frontier economies are established or prospective commodity exporters and have benefited from high commodity prices. A sharp decline in commodity prices could adversely affect export earnings, derail investment programs, and raise the risks associated with foreign borrowing. Also, the recent surge in sovereign bond issuances by frontier economies could leave the latter vulnerable to roll over risks when the bonds mature, particularly given their large size relative to the countries' reserve and other foreign assets. We see two additional vulnerable spots to keep an eye on. Frontier economies have historically depended on a narrow range of primary products for export to make money, so they need to [diversify to make themselves less vulnerable to the whims of the rest of the world, including commodity price movements. This chart shows their progress on this issue over the last few decades: [ They also need to increase the quality of what they produce and move up that proverbial ladder because faster growth in quality is associated with higher per capita incomes and higher economic stability. Opportunities for countries to upgrade the quality of their products are strongest in manufacturing but also exist in agriculture. This is particularly important because a large portion of the population in these countries is often employed in the agricultural sector. **Chance favors the well prepared** At this point the question is how will frontier economies prepare for what happens next? First, they need to continue to implement appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to maintain stability and weather what lies ahead. Economic stability is particularly important to manage risks associated with foreign borrowing. Second, they need to implement the difficult next generation of reforms, such as improvements in public finance management, while they move away from policies that can exacerbate a downturn, such as cutting back on spending. They should also deepen the linkages between their economic sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing. Continued efforts to improve public finance management will also help ensure that public investments are efficient and balanced against debt sustainability risks. Also, they will help improve the quality of products across all sectors as well as their exports.

This has generated a large current account deficit, mostly financed by short-term capital flows. The reliance on consumption at the expense of investment, slow export growth, and sizable investment needs have hurt potential growth, with the economy already growing more modestly. Moreover, Turkey's low domestic savings and competitiveness challenges have limited investment as well as exports, which have also suffered from the slow growth in Europe. With current policies, Turkey's economy is expected to grow only 3.5 percent annually over the next five years. Going forward, the economy must be rebalanced to make it more competitive and to restore output and employment growth. **Four areas for rebalancing the economy**** ** The Turkish government's economic policy agenda incorporates the right diagnosis of the economic needs, with macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that will need to be carefully sequenced: * **More public savings**. The tighter fiscal policy in the government's medium term program is correctly focused on reducing current spending while preserving public investment. This will increase national savings in the medium term by about 1.3 percent of GDP. Analysis by IMF staff (see Chart 1 and [chapter on the '_External Imbalance: Boosting National Savings Will Limit the Burden of Adjustment_'\u009d) shows that policies that directly increase national savings reduce the external imbalance without weakening private investment. Thus, such adjustment has the least negative impact on growth, and therefore on employment. If instead the adjustment were to be left to monetary policy only or to the markets, the negative effect on growth and private investment would be much larger. [ * **Renewed focus on the inflation target**. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has missed its inflation target in the past (see Chart 2 and [chapter on _'Credibility of the Inflation Targeting Regime'\u009d_). At present, the markets do not believe the 5 percent inflation target can be met in the short term. With the envisaged tighter fiscal stance, the burden on monetary policy to meet the inflation target will be lower, facilitating the authorities' disinflation objective. [ * **An expanded macroprudential toolkit to preserve financial stability**. Ample capital inflows intermediated by local banks have led to rapid leveraging in foreign currency (FX) in the financial sector and increasing wholesale funding (see Chart 3 and [chapter on '_Containing Wholesale FX Funding and Risk in the Banking Sector_'\u009d). This has complicated the task of the CBRT to meet the inflation target while safeguarding financial stability. While capital inflows have allowed financial deepening and supported growth, they have also put upward pressure on the exchange rate, promoted leveraging in FX, and fuelled excessive credit growth, potentially exposing the banking sector to direct rollover and indirect FX risk. The authorities have successfully introduced tools to reduce excessive consumer lending in the first half of 2014. More recently, they introduced additional measures to contain foreign exchange risk and promote the banking sector's reliance on core funding. [ * **More private savings**. While the right macroeconomic policy mix is important, in the longer run, rebalancing the economy will depend on structural reforms. Thus, the authorities need to accelerate the ambitious structural reform program included in the 10th Development Plan. Priority should be given to policies that encourage higher private sector savings, which has the highest impact on the external imbalance with the least negative impact on growth. _For more details, see the IMF's latest _[_assessment__ of Turkey's economy_**.** _ _ ", "index": 272}, {"pub": "12/10/2014", "title": "Managing House Price Booms in Emerging Markets", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8637", "content": " By [Min Zhu ( For the past decade, house prices have steadily increased in the vast majority of the 30 countries that make up the IMF's House Price Index for Emerging Markets released today at a [conference organized by the IMF and the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India (Figure 1). The index shows a lull in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, followed by an increase for nine consecutive quarters since 2012. This run- up'four times as fast as that in advanced economies'would be even more pronounced if the larger countries in the group such as China and India receive greater weight in the index. [ **Housing and credit booms: double trouble?** Is this steady increase in housing prices a cause of worry? History teaches us to be wary when house price surges are accompanied by booms in the availability of credit. Such 'twin booms' in house prices and credit are more likely to end in busts, and the recovery from those busts is slower and more costly in terms of lost income. [ With this in mind, the IMF has also been monitoring credit growth across the world. Figure 2 shows an increase in overall [credit growth in many emerging markets. In particular, since 2009, house price increases have been higher in countries (e.g., China) where there has been a more rapid growth in credit availability; statistically, credit growth can account for nearly half of the variation in house price increases across countries since 2009. **'Macropru' to the rescue** Policymakers are of course aware of these developments and are taking active steps to manage housing booms. This reflects a change in attitudes from the past, where the dominant view was that because it is difficult to identify and prick housing bubbles as they are developing, it is just better to clean up the mess after they burst. But policymakers now realize that they may not have a big enough mop to clean up after the fact. Hence, many countries are trying both to limit the extent of the boom and the likely damage caused by a bust, even though the task remains arduous. Along with monetary policy and microprudential policies, macroprudential policies form the trinity of policies that are being deployed. They include both broad-based tools'such as countercyclical capital buffers that protect the financial system from overall credit booms'as well as sectoral tools targeted at the housing market. These include: * Limits on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which cap the size of the mortgage loan relative to the value of the property associated with the loan. * Limits on the debt-service to income (DSTI) ratio, which restrict the size of a debt service payment to a fixed share of household income. * Sectoral capital requirements, which force lenders to hold extra capital against loans to a specific sector, such as real estate. * Provisioning requirements, which force lenders to build reserves against an eventual nonpayment of loans to particular sectors.** ** These measures are ways to try to curb an unsustainable build-up of credit'and thus keep house price bubbles from emerging in the first place'or to make sure that in the event of a bust that lenders have adequate buffers. [ Emerging markets are active users of these tools. For instance, as shown in Figure 3, macro prudential tools have been actively used since 2000, including by many Asian economies. What do we know about the effectiveness of such tools? A [speech by IMF staff at the Bangalore conference provides evidence of overall success in curbing both credit growth and house price growth. But there are important nuances. Measures to curb credit growth were less effective when high demand for houses from foreign buyers using cash instead of borrowing from the banking system. Likewise, dampening house price acceleration was not always successful unless the measures were fairly targeted. For example, Korea had to specifically target the Gangnam (yes, _that_ Gangnam) suburb to curb speculative pressures on house prices.** ** **Stepping out of the bubble** Housing is not all about 'bubbles'. In many emerging markets, developing housing finance systems and providing affordable housing remain key challenges. In fact, it is often the case (e.g., in many cities in India) that there is an excess supply of homes in the high-end segment of the market and lack of supply in the low and middle segment of the market. That is why the [conference in Bangalore brings together not only experts on macroprudential policies, but some of the world's leading experts on sustainable housing finance systems'including through public- private partnerships'and on managing urbanization. The size of mortgage markets varies across countries. For instance, Brazil has a small mortgage market (under 5 per cent of GDP) while in Malaysia mortgage loans are over 30 percent of GDP. Analysis by shows that these differences in the size of mortgage markets can be traced to differences in legal systems (one which provides little protection for lenders results in fewer loans being made), the strength of credit information systems, how onerous the property registration process is, and the country's history of macroeconomic instability. 'Food, clothing, shelter' ('Roti, Kapda, Makaan' in Hindi)'these are all basic necessities. The challenge for policymakers in many emerging markets is to provide homes for their people but to do so in way that people do not end up losing their shirts. _ The IMF's [Global Housing Watch tracks developments in housing markets across the world on a quarterly basis. It provides current data on house prices as well as metrics used to assess valuation in housing markets, such as house price'to'rent and house-price'to'income ratios.

Yet, against the backdrop of a prolonged period of low interest rates in advanced economies, huge capital flows, and a slowdown in emerging market growth, 2015 promises to keep us all on our toes. Differences in the timing of exit from unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies will have a global impact. The IMF has been keeping a close eye on developments in emerging markets, providing analysis on issues such as [how investors' differentiate between emerging market countries, [the impact of volatile markets, and [the factors explaining the slowdown in growth. In a recent [paper, we take a look back at what happened before and during the tapering episode to draw out the key lessons for policymakers. Past experience is clear: decisions by major central banks can have sizable global spillovers. Announcements by the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, have been strongly correlated with asset price volatility and capital flows in emerging markets. With expectations of Fed tightening to begin in 2015, we think a better understanding of these events can better inform policymakers' decisions. **Reading the taper tantrum tea leaves** In May 2013, when Fed chair Ben Bernanke began to talk about when and how to reduce the central bank's bond-buying program, financial markets panicked. During this initial phase of acute and systemic market volatility, emerging markets were hit indiscriminately. Many emerging markets saw their currencies depreciate rapidly, while external financing premia increased, equity prices fell and capital flows slowed. Fortunately, markets began to differentiate fairly quickly between countries with good fundamentals and those that had begun to accumulate economic imbalances.. What can emerging market policymakers do during the boom and bust cycles of capital flows? Our work shows that economic fundamentals and early action by policymakers play a critical role in managing risk and building resilience to external shocks. After the initial reaction, market pressures were more subdued in countries with: * stronger fundamentals * financial systems with more domestic services, products and liquid markets * fewer foreign holders of domestic debt and * better growth prospects. We define better fundamentals as stronger current and fiscal account positions, lower inflation, and adequate international reserve buffers. Countries with tighter macroprudential policies and capital controls prior to the taper talk also coped better. There are also actions that emerging markets can take once a shock hits. Emerging market countries that acted early and decisively to address vulnerable aspects of their economies and financial systems fared better. Raising interest rates where inflation was high, intervening where foreign exchange reserves are adequate, and addressing current account deficits'all of these moves had a soothing effect on markets. Emerging markets are not in this alone. International organizations such as the IMF have an obligation to help strengthen the global financial safety net through better cooperation with regional financial arrangements, facilitating swap lines between central banks to ensure sufficient liquidity, and directly helping with resources if requested. Advanced-economy central banks and the broader international community can also play an important role to ensure global financial stability. Clear and effective communication concerning exit from unconventional monetary support is critical to help reduce the risk of excessive market volatility. The Fed's communication strategy improved after May 2013. That is one reason why markets have not overreacted to the end of U.S. unconventional monetary expansion. Nevertheless, the normalization of monetary policy in the United States and other advanced economies is likely to cause some volatility in global markets. Emerging markets need to continue to strengthen fundamentals and be prepared for a swift and decisive policy response to eventual market jitters.

Later this week, I will participate in the [Santiago Conference in Chile, where I will meet policymakers and influential representatives from Latin America and the Caribbean to discuss economic approaches to strengthen the entire region. As I travel to the land of the Andes, I am reminded of the natural beauty of the region, the richness of its culture, and its incredible diversity. Despite its current challenges'growth continues to slow, as global economic and financial conditions are shifting and economies run up against capacity limits'I remain decidedly optimistic about the region's potential to raise living standards while protecting its unique heritage and precious environment. [And I am also optimistic about the IMF's partnership with Latin America. The Santiago Conference will be an opportunity to showcase our effective collaboration in many areas, and together with the Annual Meetings next year will cement our relations for years to come. **Great strides, but more to be done** During the past two decades, most countries in Latin America made great strides, including my host countries Peru and Chile. They were able to deliver strong growth, helped by sound policies and well-managed economies. Think about how Latin American countries fared during the 'stress test'\u009d of the 2009 global financial crisis: many were able to recover quickly without suffering their own crises, and with policy responses that helped to dampen the hit to growth and employment. These countries are well aware that in our increasingly interconnected world, economies must be adaptable. This resilience will be all the more tested as growth slows. Our latest projections show that Latin America will grow by 1.3 percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2015. As countries in the region work to make their economies more productive and competitive, they are also seeking to ensure that the gains are shared more equally. There is no question about it: Latin America has made significant advances in reducing poverty and inequality. A decade or so ago, the proportion of people in poverty was about 2.5 times those in the middle class; today they are about the same. There is broad recognition, however, that more needs to be done. Despite the striking decline in inequality in Latin America, it remains high relative to comparable economies elsewhere in the world. The rising middle class is placing increasing demands on public services like education, health care, and infrastructure. Making progress in these areas will be more difficult than in recent years, as commodity prices decline and global interest rates pick up from unusually low levels. To its credit, Latin America recognizes that these challenges need to be met while keeping a firm grasp on macroeconomic stability, which has been hard won with better policies. The Santiago Conference presents a timely opportunity to discuss these kinds of issues. The two-day event will focus on three key themes: * changes in global and regional economic conditions; * social progress in Latin America and its implications for economic policy; and * the potential role of region-wide solutions to long-standing problems.

I am looking forward to exchanging views not only with the region's top policymakers, but also with women leaders, youth, students, the press, and those dedicated to building more inclusive economies.

They have triggered intense discussions on the optimal way to combine fiscal, monetary, and financial policies to deal with spillovers, and on the need and the scope for coordination of such policies. The IMF's 15th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, which took place in Washington DC on November 13 and 14, 2014, focused on [**Cross-Border Spillovers**, and took stock of what we know and do not know. The summary below picks and chooses some papers, and does not do justice to the full set of papers presented and discussed at the conference. They can all be downloaded, and videos of each session are available, at [www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2014/arc. **Setting the stage** The Mundell-Fleming lecture by [Helene Rey set the stage for the discussion of these issues. In her lecture, Helene made two main points. The first is that there are large correlated movements in capital flows, risky asset prices and credit growth across developed and emerging economies, that there is in effect a 'global financial cycle'\u009d. The second, a more controversial one, is that countries cannot insulate themselves through exchange rate flexibility. Looking at the effects of the capital flows or valuation changes triggered by a change in monetary policy in the United States, she showed that the effects on mortgage spreads were roughly the same for countries that adjusted their interest rate and those that did not. This suggests that, in contrast to the traditional Mundell-Fleming model, capital flows and valuation changes linked to the important international use of the dollar have substantial and complex effects on the domestic financial system of recipient countries, quite apart from their effect on the exchange rate. This led Helene to conclude that only macro prudential and capital controls may be able to provide sufficient insulation. **A first set of papers looked at specific spillovers. Among them: ** Two papers on **unconventional monetary policy** examined in more detail some of the spillovers that Helene was referring to in her lecture. [Simon Gilchrist, Vivian Yue, and Egon Zakrajek'from Boston University, Emory University and the Federal Reserve'contrasted the effects of conventional and unconventional US monetary policy on foreign sovereign yields. They showed that conventional monetary policy surprises in the United States steepened foreign yield curves, while unconventional policies instead flattened foreign yield curves. A paper by [Marcel Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca and Roland Straub'DIW Berlin and the European Central Bank'looked at the use of unconventional monetary policy in Europe. It found that ECB policies had positive spillovers on equity prices across a wide set of countries, but the impact on yields was limited to the euro area, especially Italy and Spain. ECB policies increased market confidence'i.e., reduced implied volatilities and sovereign and banks spreads'but had little impact on international portfolio flows. **On the fiscal side**, an innovative paper by [Alan Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko'from the University of California at Berkeley'tackled the contradiction between models predicting that higher public spending should lead to exchange rate appreciation, and the empirical evidence that so far pointed to depreciations. Their hypothesis is that, for the shocks to spending which have been used in econometric work, it is likely that investors knew about them earlier, and that the appreciation actually happened, but happened earlier than the change in spending itself. Using U.S. daily data on defense spending commitments to obtain a better identification of public spending shocks, they find that these shocks were indeed typically associated with an appreciation, thus validating theoretical predictions. **Trade linkages** have evolved over time, one of the reasons being the development of global supply chains. [Christoph Boehm, Aaron Flaaen and Nitya Pandalai Nayar'from the University of Michigan' presented work looking at the spillover effects of the 2011 tsunami and earthquake in Japan. They indeed find strong effects of the disruptions in Japan on the imports and the production of Japanese affiliates in the United States. Their main conclusion is that, at least in the short run, supply chains are very rigid, and disruptions can affect the whole chain. **Another set of papers looked at the effects and the potential role of measures aimed at reducing specific spillovers. Among them: ** [Anton Korinek'from Johns Hopkins'provided an analytical framework to characterize the conditions under which spillovers should or should not be a source of concern, the conditions under which the market equilibrium is efficient. His results do not lend themselves to a simple characterization. But he showed for example that a world in which countries use FX intervention to provide insurance to the tradable sector in response to capital flows can lead to an efficient allocation. [Marcos Chamon and M\u00c3\u00a1rcio Garcia'from the IMF and PUC-Rio'examined the effectiveness of capital controls in Brazil. They showed that controls helped segmenting Brazil's domestic financial market from the global one, opening a wedge between onshore and offshore prices of similar assets. The initial measures had limited success in mitigating exchange rate appreciation, but the tax on the notional amount of derivatives adopted in mid-2011 triggered a significant depreciation'likely driven by complementarities with previous measures and supported by the beginning of the monetary easing cycle as well. [Julien Bengui and Javier Bianchi' from the University of Montreal and the Minneapolis Fed'analyzed challenges associated with the implementation of capital controls, suggesting that despite leakages due to the presence of unregulated agents, stabilization gains from preventing financial crises remain large. A final panel took on the discussion on policy challenges raised by increasing financial integration'including the scope for policy autonomy'and potential areas for policy coordination. [Maurice Obstfeld' a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, on leave from Berkeley'highlighted that financial openness inevitably challenges prudential tools. Channeling some of the conclusions from the Mundell Fleming address, he stressed that, even with effective monetary policy in the presence of exchange rate flexibility, financial stability issues are difficult to manage in the context of an open capital account. Cross-border lending curbs the ability to control domestic credit, and a 'financial trilemma' arises under any exchange rate regime; i.e. the fact that financial integration with global markets, national control over financial supervision and regulation, and financial stability are not all mutually compatible. This leads to an important conclusion: the need for international policy coordination depends largely on the efficacy of macro prudential policies to deal with financial stability issues. Maury stressed that critical areas for coordination going forward are financial regulation, clear rules of the road for capital controls, and enhanced facilities for international liquidity support in key currencies to counteract downsides of gross reserve accumulation. [Jean Boivin'former Canada's co-chair of the G-20 Framework Working Group and chief strategist at BlackRock'emphasized that coordination at the political level is complex, and a critical precondition to agree on a strategy is the acknowledgment at the country level of the importance of international spillovers on economic conditions. [Hector Torres'alternate executive director at the IMF Board'noted that unconventional policies put the global economy in unchartered waters, and uncertainty and disagreements made cooperation harder to achieve. He argued that the Fund had an important role to play in clarifying and fostering consensus about spillovers. Finally, [David Vines'Oxford University'argued that full coordination might be too hard to achieve, and called for 'concerted unilateral reforms' in which opportunities created by reforms in some countries influence the extent to which other countries pursue their own domestic reforms, a strategy adopted by the G-20. **Asynchronous monetary cycle** One potential take away from the set of papers, relevant to the current monetary policy challenges, relates to asynchronous exit from unconventional monetary policies. If it is indeed the case that (i) as Helene Rey stresses, the impact of U.S. monetary policy is a driver of a global factor in assets prices, risk premia, mortgage spreads, etc, and that the impact of U.S. monetary policy on global liquidity is stronger than the effect from changes in future short term rates; and (ii) unconventional monetary policy by the ECB has a milder impact on capital flows and global liquidity than U.S. unconventional policies, as suggested by the paper by Marcel Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca and Roland Straub, then an asynchronous monetary cycle between the US and Europe going forward might raise significant policy challenges and require serious policy dialogue, in particular among central bankers in advanced economies.

That is a question few governments would like to face. Yet, if a country does find itself with an unsustainable debt burden, one way or another, it will have to be restructured. And if that time comes, it is better for the debtor, creditors, and the entire financial system that the restructuring be carried out in a prompt, predictable, and orderly manner. The global financial crisis ushered in a new wave of sovereign debt crises that has reinvigorated discussions over the current framework for sovereign debt restructuring. The experience with Greece's debt restructuring in 2012 and the ongoing litigation involving Argentina, in particular, provide a salutary reminder that vulnerabilities remain. Recognizing the need for reform, the International Monetary Fund recently endorsed changes to sovereign bond contracts designed to improve the sovereign debt restructuring process. The reforms'which are detailed in [an IMF paper'aim to minimize the risk that a restructuring supported by a large majority of a sovereign's creditors could be obstructed by a small group of creditors. Importantly, the reforms resulted from a successful, 18-month process of consultation and good collaboration among the IMF, sovereign issuers, market participants, and other representatives of the official sector. The International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and U.S. Treasury were key counterparts in our discussions. At the Fund, we see these reforms as part of a broader effort to reduce the cost of crisis resolution through market-based solutions. This includes reviewing our lending framework to help our member countries address debt sustainability problems more effectively. We will also be looking at issues surrounding the process of engagement during the restructuring period'both between the debtor and its creditors, and among creditors themselves. Through these reforms, we aim to reduce the costs of crises for everyone. **What the reforms achieve** The first big change is to the 'pari passu'\u009d clause'a boilerplate clause that was given a new lease on life by the New York courts in the recent Argentina litigation. As a result, a minority of creditors succeeded in paralyzing a restructuring that was approved by 93% of bondholders. The new clause that we endorse explicitly rules out the interpretation taken by the New York courts'namely, requiring equal payment to all bondholders'and limits it to a protection of legal ranking. The second key reform is to 'collective action clauses,'\u009d which allow a qualified majority of bondholders to agree to a debt restructuring. While the widespread adoption of collective action clauses in the early 2000s was a major development, they are still highly susceptible to obstructive behavior by a minority of creditors'so-called 'holdout'\u009d creditors. Why? Most of these clauses require a majority of each bond series to vote in favor of the restructuring. As a result, holdouts can acquire a blocking stake (normally, 25% of that series) at a relatively low cost, and thereby prevent the restructuring of that series. This limitation was evident in the 2012 Greek bond restructuring, where holdouts were eventually paid out in full'to the tune of '\u00ac6.5 billion. The new collective action clauses allow a restructuring to be carried out on an aggregated voting basis. Under the most robust form of aggregated voting, a restructuring can be passed by a 75% majority across _all _bond series. This does not shift the balance of power from creditors to debtors'the restructuring still needs the backing of a 75% supermajority of creditors. Rather, it takes power away from an obstructive minority and restores it to the body of creditors as a whole. This gives certainty to creditors that either no one is in, or everybody is in. The support of creditors was a key reason for ICMA adopting the single voting procedure in their [new standard bond terms. To ensure adequate protection for creditor rights'as well as market acceptability and legal enforceability in key jurisdictions'the use of the single voting procedure described above is subject to important safeguards. In particular, all creditors must be offered the same restructuring terms, or menu of terms. There are also protections against sovereigns influencing the vote, for example by buying up a large share of the bonds. At the same time, the new clause gives issuers and creditors the flexibility to use other voting procedures'for example, in order to offer different terms'depending on the needs of the restructuring. **Putting the new model to the test** In a critical first move, Mexico, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan have recently issued bonds incorporating the new clauses. Importantly, the use of the new clauses did not have any meaningful price impact. The next step is for the clauses to be adopted widely by sovereign issuers, which is something we will actively encourage and monitor. It is important to emphasize that the IMF is endorsing critical features of these clauses'not specific language. It is recognized that, in various jurisdictions, these features can be drafted in different ways. Are these reforms a panacea? No. Importantly, there remains an outstanding stock of sovereign bonds (worth a significant $900 billion) that do not contain the new clauses, a large portion of which do not mature for another 10 years. The extent of the risk posed by these 'legacy bonds'\u009d for debt restructurings that may occur during this transitional period will depend on how the New York court decisions are interpreted in future litigation. Going forward, we will be monitoring this issue closely and advising our member countries on what additional steps could be taken to manage the transitional risks. This could include issuers swapping their old bond contracts for new ones even before they mature. More generally, of course, countries must put in place sound policies to prevent their public debt burdens from becoming unsustainable in the first place. Relative to some of the other reforms currently being considered'including at the United Nations'these contractual reforms may appear somewhat incremental. Policymaking, however, is often about achieving incremental but meaningful progress. Just as important as the outcome, the process reflected excellent collaboration between the private and official sectors. In this light, we believe that the latest reforms represent a good outcome from a good process'one that makes it a whole lot easier to carry out sovereign debt restructuring when countries need it.

If the unemployed formed their own country, it would be the [fifth largest in the world. Of the nearly 200 million people around the world looking for work, half are in emerging markets and about a quarter in advanced economies, reflecting the growing weight of emerging markets in the global labor force (Figure 1). [ What can be done to lower unemployment? For advanced economies, economists have long advocated a simple cure: more growth. This is because the [link between output growth and job creation is fairly strong in most advanced economies. For emerging markets, however, there is a widespread perception that unemployment reflects deep-seated structural problems that cannot be resolved simply through greater growth. But what is the evidence on how well growth works as a tonic for job creation in emerging markets and developing economies? In new [research (conducted jointly with Laurence Ball and Daniel Leigh), we provide an answer for a large group of about 80 countries, including the G20 countries. Our broad conclusion is that the relationship between growth and jobs holds well in a number of emerging economies. In frontier and other developing economies the relationship is much weaker. **Tonic for job creation in many countries** Our evidence is summarized in Figure 2, which shows the growth-jobs nexus using two alternate measure of the state of labor markets, the unemployment rate and the growth rate of employment. The left panel of Figure 2 shows that, among advanced economies on average, unemployment falls by a third of a percentage point for each additional percentage point of real GDP growth. The relationship between jobs and growth is almost as strong among emerging market economies, on average: an additional percentage point of output growth lowers the unemployment rate by \u00c2? of a percentage point. [ Likewise, the right hand panel of Figure 2 shows that the impact of output growth on employment growth is stronger in the advanced and emerging economies than in the other groups. In the emerging markets for instance, on average a percentage point of output growth raises employment growth by 0.2 percentage points. At the recent [G20 Leaders Summit, the member countries discussed their plans to deliver extra growth significantly over the coming years. Our research can provide estimates of the extent to which this extra growth can deliver jobs in each country. As shown in Figure 3, for the majority of the G20 members the historical link between growth and jobs has been strong, ranging from 0.6 in the United States to about 0.2 in Russia. [ **Boosting growth** The evidence that extra growth will bring back jobs in many countries leads to the obvious question: what will deliver the extra growth? As the IMF's latest [_World Economic Outlook_ notes, this requires 'continued support to domestic demand and the adoption of policies and reforms that can boost supply.'\u009d Without supportive demand policies, supply measures could have little impact in the short run. If companies do not see improved sales prospects, they will not increase capacity; hence, it is essential to ensure that the demand is there to sustain supply. But without supply measures, output gains based solely on a stimulus to demand will prove temporary. What specific policies does this entail? Broadly speaking, in advanced economies, monetary policy should continue to support the recovery in demand. Fiscal adjustment, while attuned in pace and composition to the specific needs of countries_, _must be as growth-friendly as possible. Emerging markets are [slowing down from pre-crisis growth rates. They need to primarily address underlying structural problems, which are quite varied across countries, from removing bottlenecks in the power sector to reforms on labor and product markets. In many countries, there is a strong case for increasing [public infrastructure investment, which would provide a much-needed boost to demand in the short term and would also help supply (i.e. potential output) over the longer term. **Bottom-line** Our research suggests that growth can help job creation, though the extent to which it can do so varies across emerging markets, just as it does for advanced economies. Thus, while growth is not a panacea, it is an essential part of the cure for unemployment.

Not a week goes by without the Fed, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan taking big and often unprecedented actions to fight deflation, preserve financial stability, or address mediocre growth. We tend to forget, however, that these are not the only central banks that are struggling to adapt their policies to changing circumstances in our connected world. Take [the Caucasus and Central Asia ' Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Central banking in these former Soviet republics rarely makes international headlines. But figuring out how best to design and run monetary policy is no less a challenge than in the United States or the euro zone. **New and old challenges** To be sure, over the last two decades, central banks in the region have made important headway in strengthening their monetary and exchange rate policy frameworks: they have been given greater independence (all be it to varying degrees); they have improved their technical expertise; and they have become more transparent and improved their statistics. Results have been impressive, with price rises dropping from hyperinflation in the 90s to now single digits in most countries. Of course, despite this progress, certain structural problems persist. Inflation is still relatively high and volatile, dollarization is pervasive, financial systems are weak, and several countries have low foreign exchange reserves. The recent sharp slowdown in Russia, a key source of trade, remittances and investment [adds fresh challenges, as does the related weakness of the Russian ruble because it creates tensions in these countries' monetary frameworks, which are often anchored in the U.S. dollar. On top of this, the region's energy exporters are adapting to the recent drop of oil and gas prices, a key source of foreign currency. A high-level workshop of central bankers from the region and international experts in Zurich two weeks ago organized jointly by Swiss officials and the International Monetary Fund could not have been more timely. We discussed ways to make monetary frameworks in the region more resilient to shocks and better capable of supporting sustainable growth. **Focus on price stability** The way forward, we agreed, is to move towards a clear and consistent monetary framework. In practice, this means more explicitly focusing on either the exchange rate or price stability. Some countries, such as Armenia and Georgia, have already made good progress on explicit inflation targeting. Others are still in the early stages of developing a consistent strategy and setting up the necessary institutions. The successes and failures of countries that have already made the transition are invaluable. The central bank governors from the region were particularly pleased to compare notes with colleagues from Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Russia and Serbia. **I'd like to highlight three priorities for central banks that emerged from our discussion:** * First, develop a clear strategy of defining objectives (such as price stability), choosing targets (such as the inflation forecast or market interest rates), and developing instruments (such as open market operations) * Second, build the analytic capacity to model and forecast the economy. Poor data notwithstanding, such models introduce rigor to discussions among policymakers * Finally, develop a communication policy to clearly explain monetary policy and anchor economic expectations, for example on inflation. This may require new means of proactive communication that go beyond just a website and a press release about the latest monetary policy decision. All this is of course predicated on developing the right supporting institutions, from central bank independence to a reasonably deep financial market, to fiscal authorities that are not working in the opposite direction. As many practitioners in Zurich pointed out, a monetary regime can only work if it enjoys the full support of the government. **A new peer-to-peer network ** This is a tall agenda, and one that will require determination and hard technical work over many years. How to go about it? Thomas Jordan, President of the Swiss National Bank, said: 'You can't buy reputation and expertise, but you can acquire it through networking.'\u009d In other words, the way forward is to tap the knowledge and experience among colleagues in the camaraderie of central bankers. In Zurich, we took steps to put in place such a peer-to-peer network of central banks from the region. Staff at all levels will be able to communicate directly with each other through an online discussion forum and regular meetings. For this, we will draw on the experience of our colleagues from the [Swiss development agency SECO, who have established such networks successfully in other areas, notably budgeting and treasury operations. The IMF will do its part, by moderating the discussions and providing analysis and technical advice. I have also asked our teams of economists and financial sector experts to prepare in-depth background papers on monetary issues as part of our regular consultations. Hopefully, in one or two years, we will be able to take stock of progress. We can't forget that this isn't just a technical exercise. At a [conference in Bishkek last year, we started a dialogue on a reform agenda to move the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus to emerging market status. Building a credible monetary framework is a key step forward and an area where the region can deepen its engagement. We at the IMF stand ready to support this process.

The increasing trend in global trade, and even more significant, in cross-border financial activities, suggests that spillovers can take many different forms. The understanding of transmission channels of [spillovers has become essential, not only from an academic perspective, but also policymaking. The challenges faced by policy coordination after the initial response to the crisis in 2009'illustrated by the debate on the impact of unconventional monetary policy in emerging economies'raise wide ranging issues on fiscal, monetary, and financial policies. Against this backdrop, the IMF's 15th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, '[**Cross-Border Spillovers**,'\u009don November 14-15 is timely. While spillovers are at the core of the IMF's [surveillance mandate, it is clear that a lot of work is taking place outside the IMF. This year's conference program brings together contributions by researchers both inside and outside the IMF, aimed at understanding the different channels through which shocks can be transmitted among economies, and how policies can help mitigate their impact. In particular, the conference will look at the main challenges posed by the outcome delivered by market forces, and whether there are adequate policy instruments at the national level to deal with these challenges. And if not, what can be realistically done in terms of policy coordination. **Global financial cycles and monetary independence** H\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ne Rey, Professor of Economics at the London Business School, and Research Fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), will give the keynote **Mundell-Fleming lecture **on the controversial issue of global financial cycles and the extent of monetary policy independence of national central banks. The conference will also discuss 12 papers on key transmission channels of cross-border spillovers from monetary and fiscal policies, linkages in debt markets and trade integration, as well as policy instruments to manage capital flows and international policy cooperation. Just to give you a flavor of what to expect, here are some of the questions that we will be discussing: * What is the impact of changes in US monetary policy on foreign bonds yields? Does it differ depending on the policy instrument used? Do conventional and unconventional policies have a different impact on the yield curve? * How has unconventional monetary policy by the European Central Bank worked? What was the impact on Europe and the on the rest of the world? What are the relevant transmission channels; are these similar to the ones under US UMP? * What is the impact of government spending on the exchange rate? Is it really associated to exchange rate depreciations, i.e. 'beggar-thy-neighbor' type of effects? * Do sovereign debt defaults in one country trigger defaults in other countries? Do they change the cost of financing and incentives to default in other countries? * What are the conditions under which international spillovers effects are Pareto efficient? How does equilibrium with strategic policy setting at the global level compare against equilibrium with global policy cooperation? * Is it optimal to restrict international capital flows amid financial markets incompleteness, i.e. prices sending signals that do not induce socially optimal outcomes? * Have capital controls been effective? How is their potential effectiveness affected by leaks'i.e. the limited enforcement of these measures? * Does deeper trade integration through international input linkages amplify cross-border spillovers? * Can fiscal and capital market integration dampen the transmission of leveraging/deleveraging shocks within a monetary union 'i.e. Europe? * Did growth in countries with higher trade and financial integration fall more during the Great Depression? The conference will conclude with an **Economic Forum**. A panel of experts, Jean Boivin (Deputy Chief Strategist at BlackRock and former Canada's deputy finance minister), Hector Torres (Brazil's Alternate Executive Director at the IMF Executive Board), Maurice Obstfeld (United States Council of Economic Advisers and University of California at Berkeley), and David Vines (Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford), will discuss their views on cross- border spillovers and policy coordination.

Yet, with the Asian giant rapidly [expanding its ties with the region (the share of exports going to China is now ten times larger than in 2000), their economic fates seem to be increasingly connected. And in fact, a sharper slowdown in China now represents one of the key risks Latin Americans should be worried about'and prepare for. So, what is at stake? How much do shocks to China matter for economies in Latin America? In an earlier [study presented in our [April 2014 Regional Economic Outlook, we analyzed growth spillovers in a large model of the global economy, focusing on the link through commodity prices. Here, we complement that analysis by using a simple yet novel approach that exploits the reaction of financial markets to the release of economic data. We find that growth surprises in China have a significant effect on market views about Latin American economies. **Capturing the effects of Chinese shocks through the lens of financial markets** [Fast-rising commodity prices in the 2000s, largely fueled by China's double-digit growth, led to an unprecedented income windfall in many Latin American countries. Against this backdrop, output growth soared from an average of 2.5 percent in 1982-2002 to 4.5 percent in 2003-11. But now the Chinese economy has been slowing, and its long-term projected growth has been cut by 2\u00c2? percentage points since mid-2010 (Figure 1). And something comparable has happened across major economies in Latin America. Are these facts related or do they just reflect a common reaction to something else? To find out how economic agents reassess the economic prospects for different countries in reaction to surprises about the Chinese economy, we examine the response of FX markets immediately after the release of key economic indicators. The logic is the following. If China matters for the economic prospects of a given country, we would expect its currency to react whenever there is a deviation between the actual outcome and the expected value for that indicator. Figure 2 (left panel) shows the response of different exchange rates to a surprise on the growth rate of China's industrial value added. Indeed, we found that the response of the exchange rates of commodity exporters in Latin America, such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia, are large and significant. (The surprisingly low and insignificant response for the case of Peru could reflect its more frequent exchange rate interventions). The change in [JP Morgan's Latin America currency index is also significant and relatively large (in particular, larger than the change in the analogous [Asian currency index). Commodity exporters from other regions, such as Norway, also experience a significant exchange rate response. [ The response is strong as well in the case of some other emerging markets, such as Mexico, Poland, and Turkey. While these economies are not highly dependent on commodities, this is not really surprising. Positive news in China tend to lift global confidence and risk appetite, and these are liquid currencies which often act as proxies for other emerging market assets. **Exploring the transmission channels: the role of commodities** With many Latin American countries highly dependent on commodities and China the largest world buyer of these products, the commodity sector must play a key role in the transmission of shocks from China to Latin America. If this is the case, international commodity prices should be affected when activity in China deviates from what the market had expected. Figure 2 (right panel) confirms that, indeed, China's growth surprises have a significant and large effect on the price of many commodities that are very relevant for Latin America. The behavior of investment in the commodity sector is also consistent with the relevance of this channel. Figure 3 shows that capital expenditure by the world's top mining companies started slowing last year, in a context of revisions to long-term growth in China and declining metal prices. Companies in this sector are now reportedly focused on dealing with structural challenges, such as improving operational efficiency and investment selectiveness. **Preparing for Chinese shocks** [A gradual transition to a path of slower and more balanced growth in China is welcome. But shocks to China do matter for Latin America, so the region needs to be prepared for unexpected departures from this smooth transition. Moreover, even if China's overall slowdown unfolds without bumps, the envisaged rebalancing of its demand, away from commodity-intensive investment and toward consumption, might weaken demand for some commodities, such as metals, by more than currently projected and priced in. How can the region get prepared? Ensuring prudent fiscal policy, low inflation, and flexible exchange rates, is crucial to increase the resilience of the region to eventual shocks. Beyond macro policies, the region needs to embrace a credible and bold agenda of structural reforms, focusing on improving education, infrastructure, and the business environment. These reforms would boost productivity and the ability to move up the value chain. All of the above would help not only to raise potential growth, but also to reduce the likelihood that negative growth surprises in China would trigger a confidence crisis in Latin America, making the impending adjustment even more difficult. _For an overview of China's economic and financial relationship with Latin America see also _[_article__[ in Finance and Development._** ** ", "index": 282}, {"pub": "11/7/2014", "title": "Portfolio Investment in Emerging Markets: More Than Just Ebb and Flow", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8515", "content": " [By [Evan Papageorgiou When the U.S. Federal Reserve first mentioned in 2013 the prospect of a cutback in its bond buying program, markets had a 'taper tantrum.'\u009d Many emerging markets saw large increases in volatility, even though outflows from their domestic markets were small and short-lived. Now the Fed has ended its bond buying and is looking ahead to rate hikes, and portfolio flows continue to arrive at the shores of emerging market economies. So everything's fine, right? Not quite. In our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report__, _we show that the large concentration of advanced economy capital invested in emerging markets acts as a conduit of shocks from the former to the latter. Emerging market economies can have financial stability problems even if they don't have portfolio outflows. Declines in market liquidity [arising from changes in the structure of financial markets and volatility are policymakers and investors' main rival. **Keep an eye on the ebb and flow of portfolio investment, and on the size as well** Despite retail portfolio outflows following 2013's 'taper tantrum,'\u009d total portfolio flows into emerging market bonds and equities have continued largely uninterrupted. The allocation of [emerging market assets in the portfolios of developed market investors has increased by 2.5 times over the last decade'from 5% in 2002 to 13% in 2012. Low interest rates in advanced economies have sent investors looking elsewhere for higher returns. And even though this increase in portfolio investment outpaced nominal GDP growth in emerging markets, what makes the risk systemic is the concentration of the $4.1 trillion of allocations in a few source economies and the concentration of allocations to the major recipient emerging market economies. We found that 12 out of 190 emerging market economies receive 80% of all portfolio flows from advanced economies. And portfolio equity allocations from U.S. residents alone, account for more than a third of the total for each major emerging market economy (see Chart 1). [ This is happening at the same time as other changes are taking place across financial markets, which can mean a decline in the price of emerging market assets and associated financial stability concerns. Indeed, in our latest _Global Financial Stability Report_ we estimate the largest increases in volatility between the low (normal) and the high (risk averse) states to be for emerging market assets such as bonds, currencies, and equities in addition to high-yield bonds (see Chart 2 for bonds). [ In fact, rather than interest rates, volatility may be the biggest worry for policymakers and emerging market investors, as the estimated sensitivity of emerging market local currency government bonds tends to be higher for a volatility shock than a commensurate U.S. interest rate shock across the major emerging market economies (Chart 3).

We had uplifting visions of the future in shows like_ Star Trek_ and _Back to the Future_. Today, the menu of options only offers a dystopian world ruined by poverty and violence (think _The Hunger Games_, _Divergent_, or _Elysium_). It sure is easy to get pessimistic these days. Six years after the financial crisis, the recovery in the United States has been fragile and weaker than anything we have seen in the post-WWII period. Growth figures, in large part, have been serial disappointments, disrupted by government shutdowns, debt ceiling showdowns, or meteorologically-triggered slowdowns. **Is this a 'new mediocre'\u009d?** In our last annual [check- up of the U.S. economy, we project future potential growth at only 2 percent in the coming years'a significant step down from the average potential growth rate of over 3 percent that we have seen over the past one or two decades. So what's going on? Two main sources for this weaker outlook: a [slower expansion of the labor force and a [slowdown in productivity. Over the past three decades, the labor force expanded at an annual rate of 1\u00c2? percent. The growth rate now is projected to level off at below \u00c2? percent. A large part of the drop is accounted for by aging: roughly 10,000 baby-boomers will turn 65 today, and about 10,000 more will cross that threshold every day for the next 19 years. But the shrinking pool of workers is exacerbated also by weaker productivity growth. After soaring in the late 1990s'largely as a product of the information technology revolution'labor productivity growth has irrefutably slowed. At this stage, it is difficult to say whether this is a temporary phenomenon or is here to stay. One could certainly argue that there will be a new round of technology advances in the coming years or perhaps productivity gains linked to a new 'energy revolution.'\u009d However, even if we take a middle ground'assuming labor productivity will rebound from the 2013 low of \u00c2? percent but remain below the average growth rate of 2\u00c2\u00be percent observed between 1998 and 2007'we are still left with a markedly weaker outlook for potential growth. **Roadmap for a 'new momentum'\u009d** Containing the decline in potential growth depends crucially on the will of the U.S. administration and Congress to adopt a policy agenda that encourages productive investment and innovation, reverses the downswing in productivity growth, and boosts the labor supply. Our 'Top Five'\u009d list to achieve that goal includes: * Infrastructure investment to reverse the downward trend in both the quantity and quality of the public capital stock in the United States. * Tax reform to simplify the code, broaden the base, and lower marginal rates'particularly for the corporate income tax. * Encourage innovation and improve education outcomes by reinstating the research and development tax credit, promoting and funding early childhood education, and providing greater support to science, technology, engineering, and math programs. * A comprehensive, skills-based immigration reform to ensure that the U.S. maintains a work force that meets employers' needs for highly-skilled, educated, and innovative workers. * Active labor market policies that improve training programs, provide more effective job search assistance, improve family benefits (including childcare assistance), expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to younger workers so as to encourage work, modify the disability insurance program to ensure that those working part time do not lose their benefits, and provide incentives to those that hire the long-term unemployed. Many of these policies come with a price tag'with the notable exception of immigration reform, which would likely reduce fiscal deficits modestly. However, the overall costs are not that large'we estimate around ' percent of GDP per year for the next 2'3 years. However, part of this fiscal cost would be offset by the faster growth that results from these policies. Ideally, these measures should be taken in conjunction with a broader and much-needed medium-term fiscal consolidation plan._ _ **No lack of good ideas** Some may not agree with the priorities we have articulated. That is fine. But there certainly should be a public debate on which programs could generate the maximum bang for the buck. There are a lot of great ideas out there that would improve the prospects of the U.S. economy and address the sustainability of public finances. The challenge will be to forge a political agreement on a set of ideas that both sides of the aisle can get behind. Recent progress'such as the Bipartisan Budget Act'indicate that a bipartisan agreement is possible, particularly given the intersection of proposals from both the Administration and Congress in areas such as business tax reform, infrastructure and work training programs, and immigration reform. Long-term growth in the United States will depend critically on acting on such common ground. ", "index": 285}, {"pub": "10/29/2014", "title": "A Downturn Without Layoffs? Reconciling Growth And Labor Markets In Latin America", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8479", "content": " [By [Bertrand Gruss (version in [Espa\u00c3?ol and [Portugu\u00c3\u00aas) It looks as if labor markets in Latin America have not been following the economic news'literally! Economic activity has slowed markedly in the last three years, with some South American countries slipping into outright recession more recently. Yet, labor markets still appear remarkably strong, with unemployment rates, in particular, hovering at record-low levels in most countries (Figure 1). So, what is going on? Has the region discovered how to defy the law of gravity? [ To analyze this apparent disconnect, we first scrutinize recent labor markets developments in more depth. We then assess to what extent these developments really deviate from historical patterns. Overall, we find that labor markets are not as strong as they appear, and their behavior can in fact be reconciled with the weakness in economic activity.** ** **Some weakening beneath the surface** If we compare the evolution of labor market indicators in the first three quarters of 2014 with the average over 2011-13, we do find signs of weakening conditions across the region (Figure 2). Employment was still growing in 2014 in most countries (left panel), but generally at a softer pace than a few years ago (Uruguay stands out as having seen stronger employment growth more recently). In Brazil, job creation has stalled altogether. [ Even the historically low unemployment rates disguise some softening in recent months (middle panel). Specifically, unemployment rates were on a downward path in most countries in the region during 2011-13. This year, though, the record has become more mixed. While unemployment rates have continued to decrease in a few countries (Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, though generally at a slower pace), they have started to edge up in several others (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Uruguay). To be sure, the recent weakening of labor market conditions does not necessarily imply that these markets already have slack. In most Latin American countries, unemployment remains well below the long-term average or typical estimates of the natural rate (i.e. the rate consistent with non- accelerating inflation). And while real wage growth is slowing in most countries, it is still firmly in positive territory (right panel). **Not that different from historical patterns** Once we found that labor market conditions are indeed weakening, the question is whether we should have expected even greater weakness given the extent of the current economic slowdown. Our recent [_Regional Economic Outlook Update_ addresses this question for the case of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Uruguay. We look at country-specific historical relationships between output and employment (a version of the so-called _Okun's Law_), and find that employment growth in the four quarters through June 2014 was _not_ stronger than expected for any of these countries (Figure 3, left panel). In fact, job creation fell significantly short of what economic activity would have predicted in some cases (Brazil and Mexico). [ Notwithstanding the still low unemployment rates, the change in unemployment dynamics for particular countries over the last year can also be broadly explained by output growth (right panel). The notable exception is Brazil, where by June 2014 the unemployment rate was about 1 percentage point lower than would have been expected given the economy's sharp slowdown. The reason is a surprisingly large drop in labor participation (by about 1\u00c2? percentage points). If this drop in participation were to prove temporary, unemployment could increase rather quickly going forward. **Prospects and policy options** More generally, employment growth is likely to remain subdued for some time, as changes in labor markets typically lag those in the overall economy, and output growth is not expected to revert to the high rates of the 'golden decade'\u009d anytime soon. In this context, unemployment rates will probably rise somewhat and real wage growth may well moderate further. The resulting slower growth of aggregate wage income will make it increasingly difficult to sustain the pace of poverty reduction and other social achievements observed in previous years. What can be done? The overwhelming priority across the region is to rekindle economic growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. Given that economic slack is still limited in most Latin American countries, there is little scope for demand-side stimulus, even less so in economies with weak fiscal balances. Instead, the focus should be on reforms to foster higher productivity and create better conditions for private investment. Improvements in physical infrastructure, educational systems, and the general business environment are key priorities. Pursuing targeted reforms in these areas is the most promising avenue not only for reviving growth, but also for generating more and better- paid jobs over the medium term.

Sayeh Tremendous efforts are under way to upgrade sub-Saharan Africa's infrastructure. But the needs on the ground are still immense as evidenced by the frequent electricity blackouts, poor roads, and insufficient access to clean water in many countries. Infrastructure is one of the key challenges facing policymakers in the region'I experienced it first hand when I was finance minister of Liberia before coming to the IMF. The benefits are fairly clear: with improved infrastructure, new growth opportunities in the manufacturing and services sector can be generated, barriers to intraregional trade can be reduced, and economies will be better positioned to transition from low to higher productivity activities. Without improved infrastructure, I fear the increase in productivity and greater economic diversification necessary to sustain Africa's current growth momentum will not materialize. In this spirit, in the latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa_ economists from the IMF's African Department looked at progress so far in addressing the infrastructure deficit and discussed policies needed going forward. **Prepare tomorrow's growth** Their findings are heartening. * First, many countries have managed to maintain, or even increase, their public investment in infrastructure over the last decade. * The lion's share of infrastructure projects are still financed domestically, either from increased tax revenues or local investors buying domestic public debt. African banks are also increasingly stepping in to finance infrastructure projects. * Things also have been changing for the better on the external financing front. Foreign investors, recognizing the attractiveness of the region as an investment destination, have been increasingly drawn to sub-Saharan Africa. New partners have emerged, most notably China. * And with new financing instruments, institutional investors'including pension funds both from inside and outside the continent'could soon be more willing to finance relatively risky, but high-return, projects in the region. **More to be done** That said, much remains to be done. My colleagues' work underscores the extent to which higher investment has not always translated into better outcomes for the population. Yes, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a revolution in access to telecommunications, and mobile phone subscriptions have exploded. Market liberalization and emergence of competition in the sector no doubt have been big drivers of that success. But, unfortunately, progress has been far more limited elsewhere. The region still lags far behind other developing regions in the world when it comes to supplying electricity and water, as well as to road and railway development. **Way forward** We see three things that need to be done to engender better outcomes going forward. First, it is not always obvious that lack of financing is the main constraint to better infrastructure outcomes. Instead, in many countries, what needs to be improved, within the existing resource envelope, is the capacity of the public administration to identify, implement and monitor often complex projects. Bear in mind, this is a hard task for any government. But scaling up the infrastructure effort should go hand in hand with 'investing in investment'\u009d'that is, developing a clear vision for the whole sector, and planning spending beyond the current budget. One key element of this process would be to have a central agency that prioritizes the projects proposed by the various ministries and conducts cost-benefit analyses. **Involving the private sector** Second, with available public resources always likely to be limited, it will be essential to look beyond purely public investment and involve the private sector whenever possible. True, as has been the case until now, the public sector will remain a critical provider of infrastructure investment. But with public debt sustainability also on policymakers' minds, the risk is that some valuable projects may be postponed or even abandoned'to the detriment of future growth. Hence, private companies should be encouraged to get involved as appropriate. The recent telecommunications revolution on the continent should act as a reminder that private companies can invest in infrastructure on their own if the business is sufficiently appealing and the business environment conducive to investment. This model could work in some cases for railway construction or electricity generation. There is also a middle range where public and private sectors can work together, with the former bringing in some form of insurance, and the latter its expertise executing projects and tapping innovation. Public-private partnerships are such examples, where private companies are typically contracted to build and operate projects before transferring them back to the public sector after an agreed period. Appropriately designed user fees allow companies to recoup their investments, while minimizing recourse to taxpayer money. However, experience had taught us that in such contracts, the role, responsibilities, and potential financial liabilities of the public and private partners need to be clearly defined. **Public enterprises' environment** Third and finally, companies already active in sectors such as electricity generation and water provision need to operate on a sound footing. In many cases, these are state-owned utility companies operating as monopolies, either lacking proper funding to invest or unable to generate adequate revenue because government agencies set prices at too low a level. Hence, going hand in hand with the steps I highlighted earlier, it will be critical to strengthen the performance of these companies and improve the regulatory environment. This will allow public enterprises to deliver better services, and may even catalyze interest from private investors to support their investment efforts. The formidable growth momentum of recent years in the region is still on'our latest forecasts do show that sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be the second fastest'growing region in the world, just behind emerging and developing Asia. But this momentum needs to be nurtured to ensure sustained and durable growth. Infrastructure investment is part of the solution, but it needs to be well implemented. It is an opportunity not to be missed, and I strongly believe it can be done. ", "index": 287}, {"pub": "10/23/2014", "title": "Does Raising the Minimum Wage Hurt Employment?  Evidence from China", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8453", "content": " [By [Prakash Loungani (version in [\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6??) Raising the minimum wage is a polarizing issue. One side worries that raising it will lower employment. The other side downplays the impact on employment and plays up the positive impact on the living standards of the poor. Both sides are able to cling to their beliefs as the evidence, much of which comes from high-income ('advanced'\u009d) economies, is mixed. The majority of the global labor force, however, is in the emerging markets. Moreover, for a number of these countries, instituting a minimum wage or raising it is squarely on the policy agenda. But little is known about the impacts of minimum wages on employment and living standards in emerging markets. My recent [work with Yi Huang and Gewei Wang tries to fill this gap by studying the impact of minimum wage policies on employment in China. As China accounts for nearly 25 percent of the global labor force, this evidence is important in its own right; it may also be more relevant for other emerging markets than the evidence from high-income countries. **The evidence ** Our study is the first to use data on minimum wage changes for over 2400 counties in China. We combine the information on minimum wages changes with employment data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms, which covers over 70 percent of China's manufacturing employment. While China instituted a minimum wage system in 1994, enforcement of compliance with the law was significantly tightened only in 2004; the results described below are based on post-2004 data. So what does the evidence show? On average across all firms, we find that an increase in the minimum wage leads to a small decline in employment: a 10% percent increase in the minimum wage lowers employment by a little over 1% percent. The impact differs across firms, being greater in low-wage firms than in high- wage firms. This is shown in Figure 1, where firms are grouped into deciles based on the average wage. In the decile of firms with the lowest wages, a 10% increase in minimum wages lowers employment by nearly 1.8%. The impact declines steadily such that for the decile of firms with the highest wages, the impact is 0.6%. [ We also find that the impact of the minimum wage on a firm's wages depends on where the firm stands in the distribution of wages. On average, an increase in the minimum wage raises wages by about 1%. But, as shown in Figure 2, for firms in the lowest decile, the increase is about 2.5%. The effect declines steadily and there is essentially no impact for the highest decile. [ **A glimpse behind the scenes** Teasing out the impact of the minimum wage on employment is a difficult task. A firm's employment can be affected by many factors, not all of which can be accounted for easily. Hence there is often a concern that the impact attributed to changes in the minimum wage may in fact be due to some factor that remains unaccounted for or is unobservable to the researcher. To guard against this, the evidence presented above is based on analysis in which numerous other factors that could affect employment are accounted for, as described in detail in the working paper. One strategy we use is akin to the study of twins in many areas of research'the idea there is that since twins share much of the same genetic make-up, any observed differences between them are likely not due to genetic reasons but to other factors. In our study we make the assumption that firms in contiguous regions are more likely to have similar employment trends. We then estimate the impact of the minimum wage on a firm's employment, controlling for developments in employment at its 'twin firm'. Without such controls, the estimated impact of the minimum wage is qualitatively similar to that shown in Figure 1 above but quantitatively smaller on average (see an earlier [blog for details). **Policy implications** Information on the employment and wage impacts of minimum wage changes is a critical ingredient in deciding where to set the level of the minimum wage. Our study provides the first comprehensive estimates of these impacts for China, which has a large labor force and whose experience may be relevant for several other emerging markets. Our evidence suggests that a 10% increase in the minimum wage lowers employment by 1%. Impacts of this magnitude have been found in studies for high-income countries but generally for sub-groups such as teenagers or low- skilled workers. We also find significant differences in the impact of minimum wages on employment and wages across low-wage and high-wage firms. In low-wage firms, raising the minimum wage lowers employment but raises wages more than in high- wage firms. The setting of the minimum wage has to be sensitive to these differential effects. As in the case of other labor market institutions, the design of a minimum wage system has to balance considerations of equity and efficiency (see [Blanchard, Jaumotte and Loungani, 2014 for a fuller discussion). Minimum wages can help the cause of equity by ensuring that workers, particularly low-wage workers, have enough to live on. But if raising the minimum wage lowers employment, and ends up excluding low-wage workers from employment prospects, it may have adverse effects on both welfare and efficiency.

Three major developments of the past few years have thrust natural gas into the spotlight: the shale gas revolution in the United States, the reduction in nuclear power supply following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, and geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine. **What's cooking** Over the last decade, the discovery of massive quantities of unconventional gas resources around the world has transformed global energy markets, and reshaped the geography of global energy trade (see map). Consumption of natural gas now accounts for nearly 25 percent of global primary energy consumption. Meanwhile, the share of oil has declined from 50 percent in 1970 to about 30 percent today. [ Natural gas, however, is different from other energy sources. Being lighter than air, it is a commodity that doesn't travel very easily and is expensive to transport. Hence, natural gas markets tend to be regional, and much less integrated than oil markets. Shipping or transporting natural gas requires either costly pipeline networks or liquefaction infrastructure and equipment, including dedicated vessels, and then re-gasification at the destination. The limited global integration of gas markets has resulted in substantial price differences across regions in recent years due to the U.S. shale gas boom and the Fukushima disaster, in spite of increasing liquefied natural gas trade. **U.S. shale gas revolution** With advances in shale rock drilling, a sharp surge in U.S. gas production has made the country the world's largest natural gas producer, and soon expected to become a net exporter of natural gas. The shale gas boom has also had a significant impact on the patterns of global energy trade: U.S. fossil fuel imports decreased to $225 billion in 2013 from $412 billion in 2008. Surging supply has also steeply driven down natural gas prices in the United States by about 70 percent in recent years, introducing substantial price differences across other regions (see chart). For instance, U.S. gas sells for $4 per million British thermal units, compared with $10 in Europe and close to $17 in Asia. [The U.S. advantage in natural gas has also led to an increase in U.S. [competitiveness in non-energy products, in turn affecting its competitors. The share of energy-intensive manufacturing exports in total U.S. manufacturing exports has been rising steadily, whereas the share of non- energy intensive exports has been declining. Estimates show that cheaper natural gas in the United States has helped lift manufacturing exports by about [6 percent since the start of the shale gas boom. Further evidence suggests that the channels through which cheaper domestic natural gas prices in the United States might have an impact on manufacturing exports are operating both at the intensive (expansion by existing firms) and extensive (new firm entry) margins. As more countries exploit new sources of natural gas, not only is the geography of trade in energy products likely to continue to change, but the geography of manufacturing exports is likely to change as well. While energy users in the United States have been the main beneficiaries of the energy price declines, the shale revolution has helped to stabilize international energy prices including by freeing global energy supply for European and Asian markets, offsetting some of the shortages due to geopolitical disruptions. **The Fukushima**** disaster and aftermath** The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 highlighted the environmental liabilities associated with nuclear power generation, and induced a sharp increase in the use of natural gas. Before the disaster, about one-quarter of Japan's energy was generated by means of nuclear reactors. Following the disaster, the Japanese government decided to halt production at all nuclear power plants in the country. To compensate for the resulting loss in electricity generation, Japanese electric power companies increased their use of fossil-fuel power stations and appended natural gas turbines to existing plants. As a result, Japan's liquefied natural gas imports have increased dramatically'by about 40 percent'since the disaster, making Japan the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas. The sharp increase in natural gas demand has led to higher prices in Asia'and Japan in particular'double that in Europe and four times higher than in United States. **Geopolitical tensions** The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has highlighted European energy markets' dependence on natural gas. Ukraine and countries in southeast Europe appear particularly vulnerable to potential disruptions of Russian gas supply. Should the gas cutoffs persist and be extended to other countries, the greatest impact will be on Ukraine and countries in southeast Europe that receive Russian gas transiting through Ukraine. Other countries, however, will be affected through rising spot prices, which may spread from natural gas to other fuels. **Fuel for thought** Overall, the pattern of global trade in liquefied natural gas, and energy more generally, is expected to evolve further. If the United States gradually becomes a net exporter of liquefied natural gas, we expect domestic natural gas prices to rise but still remain markedly lower than that in Europe and Asia, given liquefaction costs. Natural gas is the cleanest source of energy among other fossil fuels (petroleum products and coal) and does not suffer from the other liabilities potentially associated with nuclear power generation. The abundance of natural gas could thus provide a 'bridge'\u009d between where we are now in terms of the global energy mix and a hopeful future that would chiefly involve renewable energy sources. While markets forces shape the energy mix, energy policy has a role to play, including for coal and renewable, in turn impacting global trade in energy. Here, Europe and Japan are at a crossroads, facing a difficult balance between environmental concerns, economic efficiency goals and energy security. Getting that balance right should figure prominently on policy makers' agendas. _Read our commodities special feature in Chapter 1 of our October 2014 _[_World Economic Outlook__ for more details on this issue._ ", "index": 289}, {"pub": "10/20/2014", "title": "Banks Should Help, Not Hinder the Economy", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8418", "content": " By [Will Kerry and [Andrea Maechler Banks are struggling to overhaul the way they do business given new realities and new regulations adopted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. While banks are generally stronger'they have more capital'they are less profitable, as measured by the return on equity. There are a number of reasons behind this, including: anemic net income at banks, particularly in the euro area; higher levels of equity; and banks taking fewer risks. If they cannot change their business models, there is a risk that banks will not be able to provide enough credit to help the economy grow and recover. We've looked into this issue in our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ because banks will have to adapt their business models so they can do what banks should do: lend money. A [previous blog looked at the consequences of another change in bank business models'the reduction in market-making'on financial market liquidity._ _ **Mind the profitability gap** Bank return on equity has fallen to a historically low level, excluding the height of the financial crisis. As a result, banks with 80% of the assets of the largest institutions have a profitability gap'their return on equity is less than the cost of equity (capital) demanded by shareholders (see chart). This chart shows that while many euro area banks have a profitability gap, this problem is by no means isolated to Europe. [ **Re-pricing, re-allocating and retrenching**** ** In this new paradigm'with low profitability and new regulatory requirements'banks have responded in several ways, including by cutting costs, selling non-core businesses and running off portfolios. But banks have to do more to be in a position to build and maintain adequate capital buffers without taking excessive risks. A combination of three different strategies're-pricing, re-allocating and retrenching'could be employed. Although banks have already increased interest rates on loans since the start of the crisis, they may need to re-price loans further. However, banks with less market power will find this difficult, either because they are surrounded by competitors in better financial shape that do not need to re-price, or because they face competition from players in the capital markets who supply credit, like mutual funds. Banks may also re-allocate capital towards activities that can generate higher returns. But this may entail taking greater risks, and banks may find that they have limited capacity to re-allocate assets before they bump-up against risk-weighted capital requirements. As a result, banks may retrench from some activities altogether. **Economic headwinds** This means that as banks try to transition to new business models their ability to supply credit to the economy could be limited, potentially creating a headwind for the economic recovery. In fact, the simulations in our [latest report suggest that out of a sample of 300 large, advanced economy banks, only 60 percent (by assets) are strong enough to deliver more than 5 percent credit growth without requiring a significant re-pricing of their loan books. In contrast, even accounting for lower cyclical pressures on profits, almost 40 percent of banks require shifting to new business models before being able to meet credit demand when the economy recovers. The share of banks needing significant changes to business models rises to 70 percent in the euro area (see chart). This suggests that some of the economies that most need a recovery in lending may face particularly tough challenges in providing an adequate supply of credit. [ Policymakers should ensure that bank balance sheets are up to the task of supporting the economic recovery. In the euro area, the [ECB's Comprehensive Assessment is a golden opportunity to clean-up banks, restructure weak institutions, and resolve nonviable banks. This will ensure that the weaker banks do not distort competitive pressures, preventing the stronger banks from undertaking the necessary business model changes. Banks should also adopt a more transparent pricing model that better reflects the underlying risks they are taking. Finally, regulators should consider whether barriers to nonbank credit supply could be lifted, though this should be accompanied by new tools to prevent the build-up of risks outside the banking sector.

In part, this is the result of the incentives embedded in compensation practices and of inadequate monitoring by stakeholders. Our analysis found the right policies could reduce banks risky behavior.** ** **Our findings** In our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ we take stock of recent developments in executive pay, corporate governance, and bank risk taking, and conduct a novel empirical analysis. Using a sample of 830 banks from 72 countries, several definitions of risk, and four different empirical methods we found that when banks align their compensation practices with long-term performance (for example, by paying bonuses with restricted stock), they also show lower levels of risk taking. **Policies to make banks safer** Recently, [President Obama urged top regulators in the United States 'to consider additional ways to prevent excessive risk-taking across the financial system, including as they continue to work on compensation rules and capital standards.'\u009d Our analysis supports some of the policy measures currently being implemented in that area, and recommends new ones. **First**, banks should better align compensation with risk. Banks could link compensation better to their overall financial health by paying managers partly with long-term bank bonds. Tying compensation to the bank's default risk that way may help prevent managers and shareholders making risky bets when banks are financially weak. ** ****Second**, banks should make sure variable compensation becomes available to executives only with a lag. They should also include clawback provisions that would force managers to return past bonuses if, for example, their decisions cause losses over the longer term. **Third**, the boards of directors of banks need to be independent of bank management and should establish risk committees. **Finally**, policymakers should consider measures to ensure that boards effectively represent not only the interests of shareholders but also those of the creditors of the bank. For instance, they could consider granting board representation to certain types of bond holders. This could improve the ability of these creditors to monitor bank managers. **Measures can have an impact** How much can these types of measures contribute to prudent risk taking by banks and foster financial stability? Apparently quite a lot. Policymakers so far have required increases in bank capital to make the financial system safer, and this has indeed had the effect of reducing the amount of risk that banks are willing to take. Our data show that an increase in the Tier 1 Capital (the predominant form of regulatory capital under Basel III) of 2 percentage points generally leads to a decrease in risk taking of about 5 percent. We then compare this decrease in risk with that which would result from the changes in governance structures and compensation practices that we propose. Our figure below shows that the associated risk changes are of similar magnitude. Still, we should keep in mind that capital requirements and improvements to governance and compensation practices should be seen as complements, not substitutes, and are best implemented together. [ **We are not done yet** We also found evidence that a bank's risk culture matters. According to our study, banks where the CEO has a professional background in retail banking or risk management'where the risk culture is usually seen as more conservative'also show lower levels or risk. [Figure 3.5 in the report shows this in more detail. The opposite is true for banks where the CEO comes from investment banking (where risk taking is more ingrained), even after controlling for bank specialization and other firm-level characteristics. It is therefore important that bank supervisors complement their evaluation of the risk management function with a qualitative evaluation of a bank's culture. For instance, supervisors may inquire whether managers are setting the right 'tone at the top'\u009d and whether this tone actually trickles down to the rest of organization. Does the organization reward responsible behavior? Does the staff understand the core values of the bank and are employees (including senior management) held accountable? However, while we know that risk culture matters, we still do not fully understand why and how exactly. Academics and policymakers should make it a priority to find out.

Money is pouring into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which is fueling a mispricing of credit and a build-up of risks to liquidity in the markets'the ability to trade in assets of any size, at any time, and to find a ready buyer. Mutual funds and exchange-trade funds are the largest owners of U.S. corporate and foreign bonds (Chart 1). This means they provide a lot of credit to grease the wheels of the financial system because they have taken investors' money and lent it to corporates. [ In our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_, we analyze this trend, which can create an illusion of liquidity. It turns out what we face is really a liquidity mismatch because investors can sell their mutual funds or exchange-traded fund investments almost anytime, but these funds have in turn invested their money in instruments that don't trade quite as often, such as high-yield bonds. While this is not a problem in good times, markets can turn volatile when the U.S. Fed starts to raise interest rates, particularly if this happens in an unexpected way. If that were the case, there is a risk that many investors would want to start selling all their holdings at once, causing asset prices to drop, which would then lead to further selling by investors, which may in turn create a vicious circle of further losses and more selling. All this would complicate the task of a smooth exit from these monetary policies because of the risk of a bumpier exit associated with greater losses and volatility in fixed income markets. We've already seen an increased sensitivity of financial markets to price shocks since the crisis (Chart 2), especially for credit products, which can lead to faster selloffs. [ **More ingredients** To complicate matters, all this money flowing into mutual funds and exchange- trade funds may have created this illusion of liquidity at a time of other changes across financial markets: * Inflows into these vehicles have enhanced 'inflow' liquidity, or the capacity to trade assets cheaply, but other structural measures of liquidity in markets, such as its depth and breadth, have deteriorated. * A few fund managers hold large amount of assets, and there is what we call a 'brand risk'\u009d stemming from high concentration in the decision making across funds, as well as increasing concentration of holdings of individual bond issuers. * There is a reduction in the liquidity available from banks, which are traditional 'shock absorbers,'\u009d as well as increasing sensitivity of hedge funds to asset price changes, and institutional investors playing less of a countercyclical role. **$3.8 trillion up in smoke** The result of a rapid switch to highly volatile markets would drive a faster rise in term premiums, and widening credit spreads would spill over to global markets. For example, we estimate that an unexpected market adjustment that causes term premia in bond markets to revert to historic norms (a 100 basis points increase) and credit risk premia to normalize (a repricing of 100 basis points) could rapidly push up bond yields (Chart 3), reducing the market value of global bond portfolios by over 8 percent'that's $3.8 trillion. [ These risks to exit mean officials need to address the existing liquidity mismatches. They can do this through prudential policy measures such as removing incentives of asset owners to run'by aligning redemption terms of funds with the underlying liquidity in the assets invested.

Practical and existential questions on how to do good and _be_ good for the sake of the global economy and finance dominated the seminars at the IMF's Annual Meetings in Washington. Our editors fanned out to cover what the panelists, moderators, and audiences said in a variety of seminars, and two big themes caught our eye. **Jobs &amp; growth** With the [global economy stuck in a low growth, [high unemployment rut, how to reverse these trends is a hot topic. The average unemployment rate in developed economies stands at 8.5 percent, and among young people it's 13 percent, Christine Lagarde said in a [day-long seminar on jobs and growth. Inequality has reached critical levels. 'The world's richest 85 individuals control as much wealth as the world's poorest 3.5 billion people,'\u009d she said, citing research from Oxfam. Even economists know money can't buy happiness, but it can buy a country bridges and roads. While spending on infrastructure is a good for growth, who pays and what it means for the public purse is another matter. And more important, can it over come the world economy's lethargy, [particularly in Europe? 'Yes, yes, yes'\u009d, affirmed Larry Summers of the University of Harvard. Others were a bit wary. 'Will it come at the expense of something else that is valuable for growth, such as education, or research and development?'\u009d said Christina Romer of the University of California at Berkeley.

I know the traffic snarls on Pennsylvania Avenue are terrible, Washington cabbies ruder than ever, lots of men in dark suits (and sadly, they are still mostly men), and there is the constant rush from meeting to meeting. But beyond the long lines, long hours, cold coffee and the constant buzz of communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s, press releases, and scores of official meetings, I find my place in the rich and stimulating discussions among the non-official community. This year, over 600 civil society organizations, including members of parliament, academics, and several youth and labor groups, came to the meetings. They deliberated, discussed and debated some thorny issues. The burning issues close to their hearts? Not that different from what officials are also debating. Here is some of what I heard: International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks at a seminar on \"Challenges of Job-Rich and Inclusive Gorwth\" at Jack Morton Auditorium at George Washington University during the 2014 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings October 8, 2014 in Washington. **_Jobs, Jobs, Jobs_**! With the jobless recovery and unemployment persisting in many parts of the world, it was no surprise that this was on the minds of labor and youth. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde noted that if the unemployed formed a country, they would be the world's 5th largest country (sobering thought). The [ILO's Guy Ryder noted that 'a major policy effort is needed to reverse the slide into persistent low growth'\u00a6the priority must be to lift aggregate global demand.'\u009d On the corridors, there was broad support for the IMF's recommendations to increase public investment in infrastructure. See related chapter in the [WEO (This rings a bell for those of us who reside in DC!) **_The conversations on jobs inevitably led to discussions on inequality_**'\u00a6. This is a topic that resonates widely with civil society and the IMF's recent work (see [Ostry/Berg and [Gupta/Keen) surfaced in many conversations. Justin Wolfers remarked 'In the 1980s, the IMF was all about fiscal austerity'today, its focus on inequality marks an astonishing transformation.'\u009d But both [Oxfam and the [ITUC called on the Fund to pay greater attention to what was happening on the ground'at the country level. **_'\u00a6and gender._** Ambassador Melanne Verveer, in a [panel on women and the work force, summed it up nicely when she said women face 'a sticky floor, a glass ceiling, and lots of men in the middle.'\u009d Lagarde noted bringing more women into the workforce would be an 'economic game changer.'\u009d Many of the young women I spoke to were surprised and heartened by the IMF's emphasis on women in the workforce.**_ _** **_So what next on jobs, inequality and gender_**? Lagarde told civil society that the Fund would be operationalizing jobs, inequality, and gender into its work. We are on it, but working to do even more'\u00a6 _On a different note,** Sovereign Debt**_ was another hotly debated topic at the civil society forum. Coming on the heels of the [paper that the IMF released last week on collective action clauses, civil society reminded us that the IMF could not, in fact should not try to do everything. [CIGI's Brett House and Jubilee USA convened a panel where discussants debated the benefits of a statutory approach and the contractual approach. This is an ongoing conversation'\u00a6 [ International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks a a conference on Ebola as she is joined United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki- Moon, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and President of the African Development Bank Donald Kaberuka during the 2014 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings at the World Bank October 9, 2014 in Washington. **_The long shadow_****.** Ebola and the tragic toll it is taking lent a note of sadness to the Meetings. The [IMF and the World Bank, and other donors, met with the leaders of the three affected countries and pledged the international community's help. Many participants from the region said they really hoped that the international community would step up efforts'a sentiment echoed by Jeremy Lefroy, UK member of parliament, who led a delegation of parliamentarians to the Meetings. The IMF provided additional and immediate financing of $130 million to the three affected countries. **_The beacon of hope'the young._** The highpoint of the meetings for me was the participation by the youth. In a fantastic [panel on innovation, entrepreneurship, and the prospects for youth, five promising men and women spoke about their dreams, aspirations and how they got to where they are. Gulalai Ismail said 'to assert change, the youth need to engage in the decision making process, but they also need good mentors to make a head start.'\u009d And making a head start for next year's Annual Meetings were the winners of the Latin America youth essay contest! I was inspired and moved by their [essays that lay out their aspirations and dreams. So it was only fitting that as the week closed, the Nobel committee announced that the Nobel Peace Prize was being given to India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's [Malala Yousafzai for their struggles for young people's rights, including the right to education. **_Last but not least, three big dates to watch for in 2015_**. Civil Society is looking ahead at three big events in 2015. The Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa in July, the High Level Stocktaking Event on the Post 2015 Development Agenda in New York in September, and the Climate Summit in Paris in December. As Managing Director Lagarde aptly put it '2015 is shaping up to be a make or break year.'\u009d ", "index": 294}, {"pub": "10/10/2014", "title": "Heat Wave: Rising Financial Risks in the United States", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=8316", "content": " By [Serkan Arslanalp, [David Jones, and [Sanjay Hazarika Six years after the start of the global financial crisis, low interest rates and other central bank policies in the United States remain critical to encourage economic risk-taking'increased consumption by households, and greater willingness to invest and hire by businesses. However, this prolonged monetary ease also may have encouraged excessive financial risk-taking. Our analysis in the latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ suggests that although economic benefits are becoming more evident, U.S. officials should remain alert to excessive financial risk-taking, particularly in lower-rated corporate debt markets. **Bullish financial risk-taking bears monitoring** Persistently low global interest rates have prompted investors to search for higher returns in a wide range of markets, such as stocks, and investment- grade and high-yield bonds. This has resulted in escalating asset prices, and enabled issuers to sell assets with a reduced degree of protection for investors (we give you an example below). The combined trends of more expensive assets and a weakening quality of issuance could pose risks to stability. To track the changes in financial risk taking since the crisis, particularly in the lower-rated corporate debt market, we developed a heat map that looks at signs of financial risk taking from three angles: valuation, issuance trends, and redemption risks. [ The heat map shows that financial risk taking in corporate debt markets is rising and markets have begun to overvalue many assets. Spreads in the high- yield and leveraged loan markets are not far from levels seen before the financial crisis. The quality of new loans issued is also declining, especially in the leveraged loan market where the amount of leverage in new deals is rising. The number of 'covenant-lite'\u009d deals which give lenders less control over issuers has increased. For example, many new deals allow borrowers to issue more debt in the future without obtaining prior permission from lenders. Meanwhile, the risk that many investors could sell their holdings all at once is now even higher than before the crisis. Mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and households hold about 30 percent of corporate bonds as of the end of June 2014.The worry is that such 'retail'\u009d investors could start selling suddenly if the value of their assets deteriorates unexpectedly. For example, high-yield corporate and emerging market bond markets saw large retail outflows in May and June 2013, when investors panicked during the 'taper tantrum'\u009d episode. That event was relatively short-lived and did not involve institutional investors. A more severe episode of flight from risk by retail investors could lead to even greater financial volatility with wider systemic repercussions than were suffered during the 2013 event. **What to do**** ** Officials have acknowledged some of these risks, most recently in U.S. Fed Chair Yellen's testimony to Congress in July in which she noted some potential financial stability effects of sustained unconventional monetary policy. While U.S. officials have already taken some measures to restrain excessive risk- taking, for example in the leveraged loan market, we believe more could be done. Macroprudential policies designed to keep the overall financial system safe could be deployed as the first line of defense against rising financial stability risks. The IMF's [assessment of the U.S. financial system is looking closely at these and other policies to keep the system safe. The United States is getting closer to ending six years of policies designed to stave off the worst effects of the crisis. The U.S. banking system is now much more resilient, and economic risk taking by households and corporations is taking hold. For the sake of a smooth exit and a durable recovery, not only in the United States but gobally, it is critical that officials continue to respond to rising financial stability risks.

Unemployment remains unacceptably high in many countries. It increased dramatically during the Great Recession. Global unemployment currently exceeds 200 million people. An additional 13 million people are expected to be unemployed by 2018. The most worrisome is youth unemployment. There are examples of advanced economies in Europe where youth unemployment surged above 50 percent. In several developing economies, job creation does not absorb the large number of young workers entering the labor force every year. [ This puts unemployment at the top of the global policy agenda**.** **Working together: Fiscal and Structural** Faced with this immense challenge, we asked ourselves: 'Can fiscal policy do more for jobs?'\u009d This is the theme of the October 2014 _[Fiscal Monitor, _released today_._ Support to employment and economic growth requires action on multiple fronts. In some countries, particularly in Europe, reform of labor markets may be necessary to remove persistent rigidities. Fiscal policy cannot substitute for such reforms. But fiscal policy can work in tandem with broader structural reform efforts to support job creation. The _Fiscal Monitor_ highlights three possibilities. First, **fiscal policy can foster macroeconomic conditions that are supportive of economic activity and labor markets.** For example, deficit reduction can be designed and timed to minimize negative effects on employment. Clearly, the adequate policy mix for each country needs to be tailored to its specific circumstances. Second, **fiscal policy can facilitate structural reforms in the labor market. **How? Fiscal policy can offset the potential short term economic costs of reform. It can also help build political consensus on reform, for instance, by compensating groups that may be adversely affected by change. This allows me to make a point of general importance: going forward it is very important to improve the understanding of the political dimension of economic policy. Effective fiscal policy in support of structural reform must meet certain conditions: it should not raise debt sustainability risks; the costs and benefits of the reform need to be well identified; the costs need to be constrained in size and duration; and there needs to be sufficient certainty that reforms will be carried fully to their end. And third, **fiscal policy can be part of the overall design of structural policy measures.** Let me give a couple of examples. In advanced economies, we find that a carefully designed reduction in employer social security contributions on young workers can improve youth employment. In emerging market and developing economies, we find that removing tax barriers, providing basic public services, and offering greater access to finance and training can help address challenges related to informality and low growth in labor productivity. **Current fiscal environment**** ** In the last six months, interest rates have been low and volatility in bond markets has been subdued. This has helped ease immediate pressures on public finances in most countries. However, we are at a difficult juncture. Underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and fiscal risks continue to accumulate. In advanced economies, debt levels are stabilizing but remain elevated. In some cases, debt exceeds 100 percent of GDP. So it is important to bring government debt down to safer levels. But it is also important to be mindful of the uneven economic recovery and the risk of persistent low inflation in some countries, especially in the euro area. In emerging economies, deficits and debt ratios are generally moderate, but still remain above pre-crisis levels. In some cases, there are risks to debt sustainability from off-budget transactions and government guarantees. Many of these economies share the need to raise potential growth while rebuilding the fiscal buffers used during the crisis. In low-income developing countries, fiscal risks are generally modest. Here, efforts should focus on mobilizing revenue, better budget prioritization, and higher efficiency of public spending. Some countries also need to strengthen fiscal governance. **Smart fiscal policy**** ** Overall, the challenges I have pointed to throughout my presentation call for smart fiscal policy. This is no time for complacency. Smart fiscal policy is imperative for countries facing the difficult juncture of an anemic recovery, weak potential growth, and very low inflation. Smart fiscal policy is one that supports jobs and growth while bringing public debt to safer levels. Smart fiscal policy is one that values efficient public investment and facilitates structural reform.

Policymakers are facing a new global imbalance: not enough _economic risk- taking _in support of growth, but increasing _excesses in financial risk- taking_ posing stability challenges. 2\\. Banks are safer but may not be strong enough to vigorously support the recovery. And risks are shifting to the shadow banking system in the form of rising market and liquidity risks. If left unaddressed, these risks could compromise global financial stability. 3\\. In order to address this new global imbalance, we must promote _economic risk-taking_ by improving the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. And we must address _financial excesses_ through better micro- and macroprudential policies. Now I'd like to develop these themes. More than six years after the start of the financial crisis, the global recovery continues to rely heavily on accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies. This has helped economic risk-taking in the form of higher investment and employment by firms and higher consumption by households. But the impact has been too limited and uneven. Things look better in the United States and Japan, but less so in Europe and in emerging markets. At the same time, prolonged monetary ease has encouraged the buildup of _excesses in financial risk-taking_. This has resulted in elevated prices across a range of financial assets, credit spreads too narrow to compensate for default risks in some segments, and, until recently, record-low volatility, suggesting that investors are complacent. What is unprecedented is that these developments have occurred across a broad range of asset classes and across many countries at the same time. Finally, corporate leverage has continued to rise in emerging markets. **Addressing the policy challenges** Let me begin with banks. The good news is that **banks are much safer** **now,** having increased their capital levels and liquidity. However, this [_Global Financial Stability Report_ finds that **many banks do not have the financial muscle to provide enough credit to vigorously support the recovery**. It means that after stabilizing and repairing their balance sheets, banks now face a new challenge: They need to adapt their business models to the post-crisis market realities and new regulatory environment. **We analyzed 300 large banks in advanced economies'which comprise the bulk of their banking systems'and found that banks representing almost 40 percent of total assets are not strong enough to supply adequate credit in support of the recovery. In the euro area, this proportion rises to about 70 percent**. These banks will need a more fundamental overhaul of their business models, including a combination of repricing existing business lines, reallocating capital across activities, consolidation, or retrenchment. In Europe, the comprehensive assessment of balance sheets by the European Central Bank provides a strong starting point for these much-needed changes in bank business models. [ In other words, when banks are receiving a clean bill of health in terms of capital adequacy, it means that they are safe enough to lead a 'normal life'\u009d. But in many countries, we need banks to be 'athletes'\u009d who can vigorously support the recovery. **While banks grapple with these challenges, capital markets are now providing more significant sources of financing, which is a welcome development.** Yet this is shifting the locus of risks to shadow banks. For example, credit-focused mutual funds have seen massive asset inflows, and have collectively become a very large owner of U.S. corporate and foreign bonds. The problem is that these fund inflows have created an **illusion of liquidity** in fixed income markets. The liquidity promised to investors in good times is likely to exceed the available liquidity provided by markets in times of stress, especially as banks have less capacity to make markets. At the same time, emerging markets have grown in importance as a destination for portfolio investors from advanced economies. **These investors now allocate more than $4 trillion, or about 13 percent of their total investments, to emerging market equities and bonds**'this share has doubled over the past decade. Because of these closer financial links, shocks emanating from advanced economies will propagate more quickly to emerging markets. Together, these factors will amplify the impact of shocks on asset prices, resulting in sharper price falls and more market stress. Such an adverse scenario would hurt the global economy and, at the limit, could even compromise global financial stability. This chain reaction could be triggered by a wide variety of shocks, including geopolitical flare-ups, or a 'bumpy'\u009d normalization of U.S. monetary policy. **So, what should be done to safeguard financial stability and strengthen the recovery? For this, policymakers need to address the new global imbalance between financial and economic risk-taking**. They should use various means: To be clear, accommodative monetary policies remain essential to support the recovery so long as demand stays weak. But monetary policy alone cannot accomplish everything. Other policies'including structural reforms, smart fiscal policies, and financial policies'need to play their role. * **Let me focus on two key areas for financial policies. ** First, economic risk-taking would benefit from an improved flow of bank credit to the economy. But in order to unclog the credit channel, many banks must fundamentally adjust their business model. Supervisors need to facilitate this structural transformation, which would allow banks to improve their profitability'without taking excessive risks'and to support the economy through lending. This is particularly important in Europe where banks play a major role in financing the economy. * Second, policymakers need to design and implement a range of micro- and macroprudential policies to address financial excesses that can threaten stability. For example, in the asset management sector, greater oversight is needed to ensure redemption terms are better aligned with underlying liquidity conditions. More comprehensive monitoring and reporting of leverage in nonbank sectors and in the corporate sectors of emerging markets will help identify areas of potential vulnerabilities. To safeguard against global liquidity strains, bilateral and multilateral swap lines could be deepened to mitigate excessive volatility.Such policies will strengthen the global financial system by making financial institutions more resilient, while helping contain procyclical asset price and credit dynamics. This is highly relevant today to deal with the growing risks in shadow banking, particularly market and liquidity risks. Policy makers need to be alert to these growing challenges to financial stability, and must take further actions now both to promote economic risk- taking in support of growth, and to address excesses in financial risk-taking to maintain stability.

You have now seen the basic numbers from our latest projections in the October 2014 [_World Economic Outlook_ released today. We forecast world growth to be 3.3% in 2014, down 0.1% from our July forecast, and 3.8% in 2015, down 0.2% from our July forecast. This number hides however very different evolutions. Some countries have recovered or nearly recovered. But others are still struggling. Looking around the world, economies are subject to two main forces. One from the past: Countries have to deal with the legacies of the financial crisis, ranging from debt overhangs to high unemployment. One from the future, or more accurately, the anticipated future: Potential growth rates are being revised down, and these worse prospects are in turn affecting confidence, demand, and growth today. Because these two forces play in different countries to different degrees, economic evolutions are becoming more differentiated. With this in mind, let me take you on the usual quick tour of the world: **Growth prospects vary in advanced economies** Among advanced countries, the [United States and the [United Kingdom in particular are leaving the financial crisis behind and achieving decent growth. Even for them however, potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s. [Japan is growing, but high public debt inherited from the past, together with very low potential growth going forward, raise major macroeconomic and fiscal challenges. Growth in the [euro area nearly stalled earlier this year, even in the core. While this reflects in part temporary factors, both legacies, primarily in the south, and low potential growth, nearly everywhere, are playing a role in slowing down the recovery. **Emerging markets are adjusting to slower growth** In [emerging market economies, lower potential growth is the dominating factor. For emerging market economies as a whole, potential growth is now forecast to be 1.5% lower than it was in 2011. But, there again, differentiation is the rule: [China is maintaining high growth, despite the end of a housing and a credit boom. Looking forward, rebalancing is likely to imply slightly lower growth, but this must be seen as a healthy development. [India has recovered from its relative slump, and, thanks in part to policy and a renewal of confidence, growth is expected to exceed 5% again. By contrast, uncertain investment prospects in Russia had already led to low growth before the Ukraine crisis, and the crisis has made it worse. Uncertain prospects and low investment, are also weighing on Brazil. Finally, low income developing countries continue to do remarkably well, and this despite a slowdown in commodity prices. We forecast their growth rate to b 6.1% in 2014, 6.5 in 2015. **Downside risks are clearly present[** The long period of low interest rates has led to some search for yield, and financial markets may be too complacent about the future. One should not overplay these risks, but, clearly, policy makers should be on the lookout. Macro prudential tools are the right instruments, but one has to worry that they may not be up to the task. Geopolitical risks have become more relevant. So far, there is little evidence that Ukraine crisis has had measurable effects beyond the affected countries and their immediate neighbors. Nor has turmoil in the Middle East affected either the level or the volatility of energy prices very much. But, clearly, the risk that they do so in the future is there, and could affect the world economy in a major way. The third risk is a stalling of the recovery in the euro area, the risk that demand weakens further, and that low inflation turns into deflation. This is not our baseline, as we believe fundamentals are slowly improving, but, were it to happen, it would clearly be the major issue confronting the world economy. **And this takes me to policy implications** In advanced economies, policies must both deal with the legacies of the crisis and address low potential growth. With respect to legacies, while a major focus has been on improving bank balance sheets, debt overhang of firms and households remains an issue in a number of countries. So long as demand remains weak, monetary accommodation and low interest rates remain of the essence. The weak recovery in the euro area has triggered a new debate about the stance of fiscal policy. The low spreads on sovereign bonds suggest that the fiscal consolidation of the past few years has led financial investors to believe that current fiscal paths are sustainable. This credibility, which was acquired at a high price, should not be threatened. This does not mean however that there is no scope for fiscal policy to sustain the recovery. As we argue in one of the analytical chapters, [infrastructure investment, even if debt financed, may well be justified and can help demand in the short run and supply in the medium run. And, were the risk of stalling to materialize, being ready to do more is also important. Finally, one obviously wishes that potential growth were higher. This would not only be good for itself, but it would also make fiscal and financial challenges much less daunting. Increasing potential output, let alone potential growth, is however a tall order, and expectations should remain realistic. Yet, in most countries, specific structural reforms can help. The challenge, for both advanced and emerging market countries, is to go beyond the general mantra of \"structural reforms,'\u009d to identify which reforms are most needed, which reforms are politically feasible. Perhaps more generally, the challenge for policy makers is to reestablish confidence, through a clear plan to deal with both the legacies of the crisis and the challenge of low potential growth.

It is now worth over $70 trillion. We take a closer look at what has driven this growth to help countries figure out what policies to use to minimize the risks involved. In our analysis, we've found that shadow banks are both a boon and a bane for countries. Many people are worried about institutions that provide credit intermediation, borrow and lend money like banks, but are not regulated like them and lack a formal safety net. The largest shadow banking markets are in the United States and Europe, but in emerging markets, they have also expanded very rapidly, albeit from a low base. In our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ we discuss three ways of measuring the size of shadow banking: * The Financial Stability Board offers a broad definition of shadow banks as nonbank financial intermediaries engaged in credit intermediation (including investment funds), and a more narrow one which excludes entities which do not directly undertake credit intermediation or which are consolidated into banking groups. * We compute another measure, derived from flow of funds accounts, for a smaller set of countries. It focuses on 'other financial intermediaries'\u009d and excludes non-money market investment funds, since the latter mainly manage assets on behalf of clients and thus do not engage directly in credit intermediation. * Lastly, we propose a new, alternative definition of shadow banking as financial activities using nontraditional funding, independently of the financial institution involved. The focus on activities is one advantage of this approach. For example, securitization is classified as shadow banking, whether it is conducted on-balance sheet by banks, or off-balance sheet through special purpose vehicles. These measures show some notable differences for the United States and the euro area. They all share a similar growth trend until 2007, after which their paths diverge markedly (Figure 1). After a mild drop around 2008, the Financial Stability Board's measures now surpass their pre-crisis levels. Positive valuation effects are one of the reasons behind the pickup in the Financial Stability Board's measures, given the growth in the investment fund industry. In contrast, our measures remain broadly constant or have fallen, which reflects two opposing forces: the decline in the role of certain activities after the crisis, such as securitization and securities and repo lending, and a concomitant rise in other activities, includ\u00c2\u00ading those of country-specific entities, such as special financial institutions in the Netherlands and U.S. holding corporations. For broad monitoring purposes, it may be good to keep an eye on various measures, as they may capture different developments across the shadow banking spectrum. [ **The driver's seat** What drives shadow banking? Our analysis shows that shadow banking growth is associated with GDP growth, low interest rates and low term spreads (inducing search for yield), bank capital stringency (capturing regulatory circumvention), and with growth of institutional investors (Figure 2.A). Controlling for these factors, there also appears to be some complementarity with the size of the banking sector. Looking forward, the current financial environment remains conducive to further growth in shadow banking. Many indications point to the migration of some activities'such as lending to firms'from traditional banks to the nonbank sector. Especially in the euro area, the growth of lending by shadow banks seems to gather force, while its share of total lending remains high in the United States (Figure 2.B). The analysis in our report shows that in the euro area and the United States, investment funds, traditionally considered less risky (think PIMCO or Blackrock) have been growing the fastest since 2009'but taking on more risk. Some of these funds have been venturing into less liquid assets, including loans to companies. [ **More data needed** We recommend policymakers should keep an eye on how different shadow banking activities and entities grow and may contribute to systemic risk. We need more data on balance sheets of shadow banking entities to improve our understanding of the risks that shadow banks (and their growth) may pose'that is, whether they engage in excessive maturity or liquidity transformation, how much leverage is involved, how risky their credit positions are, and how interconnected they are with the rest of the financial system. So far, such analysis can only be undertaken in very broad terms for some broad shadow banking sectors. Hence, a definitive assessment of whether the growth of shadow banking is good or bad for financial stability cannot yet be given ' but there are indications of risk build up, at least in some sectors.

Unfortunately, that backbone is becoming increasingly brittle in a number of advanced economies. For example, there has been a decline in the overall quality of infrastructure in the United States and Germany (Figure 1; see the [FT 2014 and [ASCE 2013 for more in infrastructure in the U.S., and [Der Speigel 2014 and [Kunert and Link 2013 for Germany). In many emerging market and developing economies, the expansion of the backbone has not kept pace with the broader economy, and this is stunting the ability of these economies to grow. [ Our study'[Chapter 3 in the October 2014 _World Economic Outlook_' examines the macroeconomic effects of public investment in a large number of countries and finds that in the current global environment of sub-par growth, there is a strong case for increasing public infrastructure investment in countries where conditions are right. **A crumbling backbone** The evolution of the stock of public capital'the most widely available proxy for infrastructure'suggests rising inadequacies in infrastructure provision. Public capital has declined significantly as a share of output over the past three decades in both advanced and developing countries (Figure 2). In advanced economies, public investment was scaled back from about 4 percent of GDP in the 1980s to 3 percent of GDP at present (maintenance spending has also fallen, especially since the financial crisis). In emerging market and developing countries, sharply higher public investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s raised public capital stocks, but since then public capital relative to GDP has fallen. [ **Road to prosperity** Does investing in infrastructure really pay off? In our study, which uses a combination of empirical analysis and model simulations, we find that increased public infrastructure investment can have powerful effects on the macroeconomy. It raises output in the short term by boosting demand and in the long term by raising the economy's productive capacity. In a sample of advanced economies, a 1 percentage point of GDP increase in investment spending raises the level of output by about 0.4 percent in the same year and by 1.5 percent four years after the increase (Figure 3, panel 1). In addition, the boost to GDP a country gets from increasing public infrastructure investment tends to offset the rise in debt, so that the public-debt-to-GDP ratio does not rise (Figure 3, panel 2). In other words, public infrastructure investment could pay for itself, if done correctly. [ But the benefits depend on a number of factors. We find that the positive effects of increased public infrastructure investment are particularly strong if certain conditions are in place. * **First**, the short-term boost to output is substantially larger when public investment is undertaken during periods of economic slack and monetary policy accommodation, with the latter limiting the increase in interest rates in response to the rise in investment (Figure 4, panels 1 and 2). * **Second**, the output effects are bigger in countries with a high degree of public investment efficiency'where additional public investment spending is not wasted and is allocated to projects with high rates of return (Figure 4, panels 3 and 4). * **Finally**, public investment that is financed by issuing debt has larger output effects than when it is financed by raising taxes or cutting other spending (Figure 4, panels 5 and 6). [ **A golden opportunity** In this context, current conditions present a golden opportunity to increase public infrastructure investment in countries with infrastructure needs. In many advanced economies there is still substantial economic slack and interest rates are at historic lows'which means a bigger bang for the buck for such investment. Now is also a good time for many emerging market and developing countries to boost infrastructure investment. Many of these economies may not have the economic slack as in advanced economies, and their public investment processes tend to be less efficient. As a result, increased infrastructure investment may lead to a smaller boost to output, and may even come at the cost of higher public debt. But if infrastructure bottlenecks have been constraining growth'which is the case in [Brazil, [India, the [Philippines, and [South Africa, just to name a few'the gains are still likely to be large. Clearly, the scope for investment and the efficiency of such investment differs across countries. However, our study finds that infrastructure investment can provide a powerful impetus for economic activity and jobs in countries So our bottom line? Now is a good time to invest in infrastructure. But invest well, where there is a clear need, and invest efficiently. Productive and efficient investment will provide a much-needed boost to output, both today and in the future.

What could possibly link the spectacular vistas of Crater Lake to the glistening White Sands? **Answer**: One link is these two states have the highest share of computer and electronic production in the entire United States. Think Intel in the Silicon Forest or Los Alamos. They also rank similarly in information technology usage by their businesses. [ [ Despite this advantage in cutting edge science, in [recent work we show these two states at polar ends in terms of productivity performance over the past decades. Businesses in these two states have had a very different experience in translating their passion for tech into productivity. To illustrate, between 2005 and 2010, a $100 investment in capital and labor in Oregon would have yielded a $25 payback, while a similar investment in New Mexico would have paid only $5. How can this be possible? Before answering that question, let's quickly review the facts. **The U.S. productivity story** U.S. total factor productivity (productivity gains from the more efficient use of capital and labor, and technological progress) grew at about 1\u00c2\u00be percent a year during 1996'2004. Then the growth rate halved from 2005'13. This trend began well before the financial crisis even started (see Chart 1). Together with [lower labor force participation, this slowdown has meant lower potential growth of the U.S. economy. Our calculations indicate potential output falling from above 3 percent to around 2 percent in the span of a decade. [ **Technology versus efficiency** We find that the moderation in total factor productivity growth has been widespread across U.S. states, but the degree to which it has happened has varied greatly. The decline ranges from over 3 percentage points in New Mexico and South Dakota to below 1 percentage point in states like Washington, Oregon, Nebraska, and Maryland (see Chart 2). The Oregon and New Mexico comparison tells us that the reasons for this different performance must go well beyond the winding down of the tech boom. If it were just a tech story, we should have seen a closer relationship between the states' productivity performance and specialization in information technology. Instead, we see almost no relationship between the extent to which states either produce or use information technology and the change in productivity growth. [ The explanation lies in the fact that, while innovation matters, it's just one ingredient in productivity. Another important dimension is the _efficiency_ with which firms and states combine those innovation gains with their labor, land, capital, and other inputs. Think back to your college economics classes and picture 'progress'\u009d as being split up into moving outwards the 'production frontier'\u009d'the maximum amount of output that can be obtained from a fixed amount of resources'and closing the distance to the nirvana of the frontier by becoming more 'efficient.\" Our work shows that there is a large variation in efficiency across U.S. states (see Chart 3). On average, U.S. states have been moving somewhat further from that frontier, falling short of deploying new technology and ways of creating value added. If every state had been able to keep up with the average efficiency of the country, real GDP per worker in 2010 would have been 3 percent higher than it actually was. This translates into $400 billion in additional consumption, investment, and exports (over $1,000 for every American man, woman, and child).** ** [ **How to get to nirvana**** ** Our analysis shows that those states that do better have more years of schooling, better educational attainment, more research and development spending, and a bigger financial sector. We find the same result when trying to explain why productivity growth differed across U.S. states over the past two decades.** ** The implications for policies are clear. Focus public policy efforts on facilitating investment in human capital, innovation, knowledge creation, and improving financial intermediation. Let's look again at Oregon and New Mexico. Over the past 15 years in the Beaver State, the average years of schooling have increased three times as much as that in the Land of Enchantment. Similarly, business research and development spending in Oregon is 1\u00c2? percent of GDP more than that in New Mexico.

Are emerging markets slowing down?** Yes. They have been slowing down for some time now. GDP growth has declined from 7 percent during the pre-crisis period (2003-8) to 6 percent over the post-crisis period (2010-13) to 5 percent, in our projections, over the next 5 years (2014-18). This path is illustrated below in Chart 1. This last point stands out. Despite an uneven recovery, growth in advanced economies is projected to eventually recover. Not so for emerging markets. [ Chart 1 **More worrisome is the medium'term outlook,** where projections have been revised down serially since 2010 (Chart 2). This feature of repeated downward revisions to future growth is unique to the current downturn. In the past, we expected growth to bounce back (and it did). This time seems different. And, to some extent, weaker productivity and lower potential growth may be to blame. [ Chart 2 **The slowdown is broad based.** Growth rates are lower than the pre crisis average in more than 70 percent of emerging markets since 2012 (see the red bars in Chart 3). This 'head count'\u009d indicates that slower growth extends well beyond the largest emerging markets like China and India. [ Chart 3 **2\\. Will this have implications for the world economy?** Yes. See the IMF's [_2014 Spillover Report__. _The report highlights several key spillover channels and what we can expect. * _Expect lower growth in trading partners:_ A 1 percentage point slowdown in emerging market economies lowers growth in advanced economies by \u00c2? percentage point, on average, through reduced trade. * _Expect lower commodity prices._ Emerging markets account for the bulk of commodity demand globally. A slowdown means a fall in demand which would lead to a fall in prices. Whether it is good or bad for incomes depends on whether a nation mainly consumes (good) or produces (bad) those commodities. * _Expect bank losses._ A slowdown usually triggers problems in the repayment of loans and could lead to capital losses for banks, including those in advanced economies exposed to Emerging Market borrowers. * _Expect slower growth if you live in the same neighborhood._ For example, a slowdown in China and Brazil would impact emerging Asia and Southern Cone countries, respectively, through trade. Russia would have an impact on its Central Asian neighbors through remittances, while Venezuela would affect its Central American neighbors through financing and energy cooperation agreements. **3\\. Can anything be done to reduce risks associated with the slowdown?** Yes. The report also talks about how international coordination and policy preparedness will be key. * _More collaboration between advanced and emerging market economies_ to manage both spillovers and the possible consequences for the original spillover source economies themselves, known as spillbacks. * _Renewed attention to structural reforms for emerging economies_ to boost productivity and medium-term growth. While national priorities differ, common threads include addressing infrastructure needs, improving education and addressing skill shortages, and enhancing competition and improving business climate.

We need an approach that builds on national self-interest and spurs a race to the top in low-carbon energy solutions. Our findings here at the IMF'that carbon pricing is practical, raises revenue that permits tax reductions in other areas, and is often in countries' own interests'should strike a chord at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York next week. Let me explain how. Ever since the 1992 Earth Summit, policymakers have struggled to agree on an international regime for controlling emissions, but with limited success. Presently, only around 12 percent of global emissions are covered by pricing programs, such as taxes on the carbon content of fossil fuels or permit trading programs that put a price on emissions. Reducing CO2 emissions is widely seen as a classic 'free-rider'\u009d problem. Why should an individual country suffer the cost of cutting its emissions when the benefits largely accrue to other countries and, given the long life of emissions and the gradual adjustment of the climate system, future generations? **From burden to benefits** This argument crucially ignores immediate domestic environmental benefits from reducing CO2. Fossil fuel combustion, especially coal, is a leading cause of local outdoor air pollution which, according to World Health Organization figures, is estimated to cause over 3 million premature deaths a year worldwide'through increasing the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and so on. Taxing the carbon content of coal will increase its price, and decrease its use, leading to both fewer CO2 emissions and better public health due to cleaner air. A carbon tax would also increase motor fuel prices, which will reduce traffic congestion and accidents as people economize a bit on their use of vehicles. This again spurs domestic economic benefits, at least in countries where people are not already fully charged for these adverse effects through existing motor fuel excises. These health and other 'co-benefits'\u009d from reducing fossil fuel use add to the gains in economic efficiency that start with pricing CO2 emissions. Ideally, governments would use other policies to address domestic environmental problems, like charges for local air pollution. However, until these policies are fully implemented (likely a long time), policymakers should look at how the indirect impact of CO2 pricing can help alleviate these problems when they consider shorter-term climate policies. So how important are these domestic co-benefits? A new [IMF working paper assesses how much CO2 pricing is in countries' own national interests by looking at the domestic co-benefits alone'before even counting the climate benefits. The findings, summarized in the chart below, are striking in two regards. First, a substantial carbon tax (or CO2 pricing through trading systems) is justified by national interests, on average $57.5 per ton of CO2 across the top twenty emitters. This is several times the recent prices in the European Union's Emissions Trading System, and 60 percent higher than the climate damages per ton of CO2 estimated by an inter-agency group for the U.S. government. The implication is that countries need not wait on an international agreement to move ahead with their own CO2 pricing schemes. Second, prices that are efficient from a national perspective vary considerably across countries. For example, they are relatively high in China and Poland'where most of the CO2 reduction would come from less reliance on coal and there is high population exposure to coal pollution'and they are relatively low in Australia, where population exposure is far more limited. The implication here is that any international regime should be flexible, allowing some countries (with high co-benefits) to set higher CO2 prices than others (similar to value-added and excise taxes in the European Union, for which member states can set tax rates higher than the agreed upon floor). [ **A Message for Finance Ministers** CO2 pricing through carbon taxes or trading systems with allowance auctions would also raise significant new government revenues. And, as with any new tax, it is important to use these revenues productively'most obviously to lower the burden of other taxes. Environmental tax reform is generally about smarter taxes not higher overall taxes. This last point underscores the potentially pivotal role of finance ministries, which to date have largely taken a back seat in climate negotiations, in integrating carbon pricing into broader fiscal reforms. They have good reason to urge effective carbon pricing, and this may not happen without their strong advocacy. And carbon taxes, in particular, would represent a straightforward extension of existing motor fuel excises, which are well established in many countries and among the easiest of taxes to administer, by building a carbon charge into them and applying similar charges to other fossil fuel products. **New York, Paris, and beyond** These findings complement other important work in the area, such as the [report recently issued by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. They should also hearten participants at next week's Climate Summit, which is set to catalyze commitments ahead of the pivotal December 2015 meetings in Paris, at which policymakers hope to finalize an international climate agreement. There is no need for action to await coordinated measures adopted by many countries'a lot can be achieved simply by looking at national self-interest.

Intended or not, it conjures images of dark, sinister, and even shady transactions. With a name like 'shadow banking'\u009d it must be bad. This is unfair. While the profession lacks a uniform definition, the idea is financial intermediation that takes place outside of banks'and this can be good, bad, or otherwise. Our goal here is to shine a light on shadow banking in China. We at the IMF have used many terms. Last year, we had a descriptive one, albeit a mouthful'off-balance sheet and nonbank financial intermediation. The [April 2014 _Global Financial Sector Report _(GFSR) called it nonbank intermediation. This year our [China Article IV report used the term shadow banking. **What's in a name** 'That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.'\u009d Taking a cue from Shakespeare's Juliet, let us not worry about the label and instead focus on the facts. Interest in China's shadow banking'\u00a6eh, nonbank intermediation'\u00a6stems mainly from its rapid growth since the global financial crisis in 2008. This is the pink part in Figure 1 which has more than tripled since 2008, albeit from a low base. It has also accounted for half of the increase in overall credit to the economy or total social financing'even more than bank loans. [ Shadow banks have dominated total credit growth since 2009 In China, shadow banking is often defined as total social financing less bank loans. We tend to exclude equity issuance'firms raising money by selling stock (as this is not credit)'which is the green part in Figure 1. Thus, we focus on the pink part. [ Trusts, which seem to play a 'bank-like'\u009d role in lending, have grown assets quickly The pink part'that is shadow bank or nonbank intermediation'consists of the four components in Figure 2: * **Corporate bonds.** Yes, corporate bonds are the largest component of so-called shadow banking. * **Entrusted loans.** These are corporate to corporate loans, administered by a bank. Company A has excess cash, it lends to company B. The bank is just a necessary bookkeeper with no 'skin in the game,'\u009d but a needed one, since in China's system, A cannot directly lend to B. * **Bankers' acceptances.** These are letters of guarantee issued by a bank that its customers can use to finance a transaction. These are 'undiscounted'\u009d as the bank is issuing a guarantee rather than an actual loan. Once 'discounted,'\u009d this form of credit is recorded in bank loans. * **Trust loans.** This is lending by trust companies. Unlike a bank loan, though, on paper the trust company just brings the borrower and investor together for a fee. **Size of China's Shadow banking** The [Financial Stability Board suggests that China's shadow banking sector is quite small, as in many other emerging market economies. Figure 3 shows that shadow banking in China is relatively low both as a share of GDP and as a share of financial intermediation. But the Financial Stability Board filters out of its estimates those parts of the nonbank financial system that are not formally involved in 'credit intermediation.'\u009d And there's the rub. In China, it is often not clear whether shadow banks, such as trusts, really are just loan arrangers or whether they are lending like a bank and taking on credit risk. Reflecting this uncertainty, shadow banking in China could be measured more broadly. Specifically, the pink area in Figure 1 (55 percent of GDP). The forthcoming October_ Global Financial Stability Report_ uses an estimate of 35 percent of GDP, as it subtracts corporate bonds (nearly 20 percent of GDP) from the pink area. [ China's shadow banks, while expanding fast, are still modest in size when compared internationally **Bottom-line: is Shadow Banking a Sweet Smelling Flower or a Thorny Bush?** Both. On the plus side, the expansion of nonbank intermediation marks progress in financial development. It benefits companies by providing alternative ways to borrow. And, it benefits households, by giving them more investment opportunities, which is especially important given the ceiling on deposit interest rates. Therein, however, also lays the thorn. Shadow banking provides an opportunity to circumvent regulations, such as the deposit interest rate ceiling (but there are many others). For example, rather than putting money in a deposit, a bank's customer could buy a wealth management product from the bank that offers a higher return. This wealth management product, in turn, may invest in equities and bonds but can also, subject to a limit, invest through shadow banks in assets that look a lot like bank loans. More broadly, shadow banking moves intermediation outside of formal banking'which has safeguards such as capital requirements, provisions against loan losses, loan to deposit ratios, well-established supervision and regulation'to more uncharted territory. The regulators and supervisors are trying to keep up with this fast-moving sector, with some recent success, but it remains a huge challenge. At the same time, investors appear to have been largely protected from the inevitable losses that should come with risky lending. It is hard to find a case, for example, of investors in a fixed income trust or wealth management product incurring any losses. This perpetuates the perception that the trust company and/or selling bank, perhaps for reputational reasons, is implicitly guaranteeing the investment. Meanwhile, investors may not appreciate the underlying risk of such products and invest too much of their saving in them. And, this is just the tip of the iceberg in assessing the benefits, costs, and risks of shadow banking, which is a topic for another day. The forthcoming October_ _issue of the_ Global Financial Stability Report _will have a broader discussion of shadow banking in China and elsewhere.

Corkery/DoD/Sipa USA/Newscom After more than five years of exceptionally low interest rates, the U.S. Fed is getting closer to the point of managing a liftoff of policy interest rates from close to zero. As of today, liftoff is expected to take place by around mid-2015. But this is not set in stone. The Fed has repeatedly emphasized that the timing will depend on the state of the U.S. economy. If things look better, policy rates may increase earlier. Conversely, weaker than expected data may well mean that interest rates will move up later. In our view, based on our most recent [economic projections, there is some scope for policy rates to stay at zero for a little while longer than mid-2015, given the remaining slack in the labor market and still low inflation. **Moving onto the launchpad** Although the Fed has to deal with multiple areas of uncertainty, the decision of when to move monetary policy onto the launchpad depends on two main factors: **First, how much 'labor market slack'\u009d there is in the economy.** The unemployment rate has declined faster than anyone had expected even a year or so ago. It stood at 6.1 percent in August, which suggests that the economy may soon hit the speed limit created by labor force constraints (see Chart 1). Short-term unemployment is even lower'at 4.2 percent'and below its long-run average. However, there are still almost 3 million Americans who have been [jobless for at least 27 weeks, more than 7 million part-timers that would like to work more, and close to 2 million others that have stopped looking for work. This points to more slack in the labor market than the headline unemployment numbers would suggest. At current rates of job growth, it may take 3 or 4 more years for the economy to fully absorb these workers.** ** **[ ** **Second, to what extent this slack translates into future wage and price inflation.** The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has been moving up (personal consumption expenditure inflation was 1.6 percent in July) but is still well below the Fed's 2 percent target. Also, there is little sign of a concerted increase in wage costs, particularly when measured alongside productivity (see Chart 2). Taken together, this means the Fed can remain patient before proceeding with the countdown toward higher policy rates.** ** [ **The dark side of the moon**** ** At the same time, keeping policy rates at zero raises the likelihood that financial markets get ahead of themselves and investors start to over-reach. Nobody wants to repeat the financial excesses that led to the Great Recession. Concerns about financial stability may tilt the balance in favor of raising rates sooner rather than later. Indeed, there are some vulnerabilities developing in various parts of the financial system and in some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt that account for a bit less than a quarter of the corporate bond market, valuations appear stretched, and issuance has been brisk (see Chart 3). The authorities are also monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of supervisory guidance as underwriting standards deteriorate. [ Linked to the potential frothiness of credit markets, we are also seeing asset managers increasingly investing in some of the riskier and less liquid credit markets. An unexpected reassessment of when and how fast the Fed will raise interest rates or an abrupt unwinding of investors' current high tolerance for risk could well lead to a rush for the exits and a sudden re-pricing of assets. This would almost certainly have macroeconomic costs both in the United States and abroad. There is scope to tackle these risks now with macroprudential policies. For example, there could be more demanding underwriting standards for banks that extend intermediate leveraged loans, regulators could tighten the limits on large exposures to riskier assets, prudential rules could be made tougher for regulated entities that hold riskier assets, and actions could be taken to address the mismatch between the liquidity promised to fund owners in good times and the ability of asset managers to provide liquidity in times of stress. Overall, our current assessment is that monetary policy should remain committed to achieving the Federal Reserve's mandate of price stability and maximum employment, while macroprudential policies should be the first line of defense against financial excesses, which can threaten systemic stability. **[Ground control to Major Tom** Timing is everything'but so is communication. Certainly, for NASA, the key to a successful mission is highly dependent on a functioning system of communications. The same is true for the Fed's efforts at guiding the economy onto a stronger growth path. The Fed's [communications toolkit should continue to evolve, as it has done, to update Wall Street and Main Street about how it views the evolution of the economy toward its objectives of full employment with price stability. This could involve more frequent press conferences, a regular monetary policy report that gives the Fed policymakers' majority view on the outlook, and providing clarity about the role of financial stability in monetary policy decisions. All in all, timing the liftoff is a tough call to make. It will, inevitably, depend on how well the U.S. economy does in the next several months. While there are tangible risks, we remain optimistic that a solid period of economic growth ahead will facilitate a Fed interest rate lift-off.

But an equally important issue is what policies play a clear role in reducing income inequality. The results of [our new study suggest that improvements in education'even more than factors such as government expenditure or financial sector development'have contributed in an important way to reducing income inequality within countries. **Growth-equality nexus** In our study, we first explore whether a country's income distribution becomes more equal as it grows richer'a question that has intrigued economists as far back as Simon Kuznets. Is income inequality reduced as countries grow more prosperous? Does this relationship depend on the country's stage of economic development? What factors affect it? Examining historical data, we found that increased prosperity, on average, leads to lower inequality. A one percent increase in GDP per capita reduces the Gini coefficient'a measure of income inequality that ranges from 0 for perfect equality to 1 for absolute inequality'by around 0.08 percentage points. Further, we found that growth in a country's GDP boosts the relative income share of the poor and the middle class at the expense of the richest 20 percent. In other words, not only do the poor and the middle class benefit from growth, they actually benefit proportionately more than the rich. These results hold true across regions and across different stages of development. We tried to pinpoint exactly how increased prosperity helps reduce inequality. We discovered that education plays a key role. Indeed, our results suggest that education policies'particularly those that concentrate on equity and skills'can be among the most potent levers countries have to reduce income disparities over the longer term. **Role of technology** If growth reduces inequality, how does this square with the increase in labor income and earnings inequality that has been observed in many countries over the past few decades? Technology and globalization are two possible ways to explain this phenomenon. Technological change has conferred an advantage to those adept at working with computers and information technology. And global supply chains have moved low- skilled jobs out of advanced economies, depressing prospects of workers who previously held these jobs. Even in countries to which these jobs relocate, the initial beneficiaries are often the more skilled workers. Education matters because educated individuals are better able to cope with technological and environmental changes that directly influence productivity levels. Indeed, better education is the best policy to help countries avoid the increase in income inequality that often results from technological change and globalization. **Policy implications** So what can be done? For many advanced economies, including the United States, bringing down inequality in the future means increasing the supply of highly educated workers. Too many youth drop out of high school; too many high school graduates are not college-ready. Then there is the cost of higher education, which in the United States is prohibitively expensive for many families. These are problems that could be solved by better government policies. In many developing countries, levels of educational attainment still remain uncomfortably low, with access to even basic education constrained by market failures and inefficient policies. While the precise focus of policies necessarily varies across countries, a number of broad areas can sketched out. Education policies that help students achieve strong academic outcomes, continue on to higher levels of education, and acquire skills needed to succeed in a globally competitive economy can foster greater intergenerational earnings mobility and help reduce income inequality over time. In developing countries, policies that promote equal access to basic education'such as cash transfers aimed at encouraging better attendance at primary schools or spending on public education that benefits the poor'could reduce inequality by helping build human capital and making educational opportunities less dependent on socioeconomic circumstances.

But while the outlook for the continent remains strong, individual countries have faced problems and the uncertain global outlook continues to pose risks. Against this backdrop, what are the policies that Africa should pursue to sustain the positive momentum for the continent? In reality, Africa Rising has never been about unbridled optimism; it has been a tale of strong growth tempered by serious challenges. And rising in economic terms is as much about sustaining expansion as about the dimensions of growth itself. The extended process of African development also requires increased resilience to shocks, and it is this resilience that may be tested by economic problems in some African nations. Strong growth'and increased resilience'were the focus of the [Africa Rising conference organized in May by the IMF and the government of Mozambique in Maputo. The nearly 1,000 officials, corporate executives, civil society representatives, and journalists who gathered for the two-day [event discussed the difficult issues that must be addressed if Africa is to maintain its upward trajectory of the past two decades. **Parallel issues** These issues have parallels across sub-Saharan Africa as each country pursues its own path to development. It is by examining individual countries in detail that we gain a clearer understanding of what has been achieved and what remains to be accomplished. For this reason, the IMF African Department compiled a book on Mozambique called _Mozambique Rising: Building a New Tomorrow_, which is available in [English, [French and, most recently, [Portuguese. The book examines Mozambique's macroeconomic accomplishments, from its emergence from civil war in 1992 to its current efforts to build on discoveries of massive reserves of coal and natural gas. But it also describes the myriad of challenges that must be addressed if the country and its people are to achieve their potential. Mozambique's immediate priorities are to share the benefits of two decades of strong growth more broadly, and to shepherd the economy through the transformation from a traditional agricultural base to one centered on mining, agro-business and processing, and services. As the book makes clear, reaching these objectives will require continued institutional and capacity building in public administration to further improve the foundations and structures of economic policymaking and governance, and adapt them to a fast-changing world. It will also require further efforts to create an environment conducive to private sector development since this will need to be the primary source of future employment. It also calls for the government to work with small and large enterprises to make Mozambique more business friendly and competitive. **Natural resources** As with several other emerging African nations, Mozambique's future is inextricably tied to the development of natural resources and foreign-financed megaprojects that are capital intensive and export oriented. There is no doubt that these projects will make a significant contribution to growth, but so far they have generated only limited employment opportunities and government revenues. To fully benefit from this strategy Mozambique will require a more dynamic business climate and changes to its tax regime. Resource development also requires substantial changes to the formulation of fiscal policy. Mozambique's resource revenues, while modest to date, are likely to become sizable in a few years, thus affording a unique opportunity to close infrastructure gaps, invest in priority sectors such as health and education, support more inclusive growth, as the economy radically transforms. However, capacity constraints seem high, and the pace at which resource wealth is anticipated and used should be gradual. To reap the full returns on scaled-up public investment, reforms would also need to enhance the efficiency of investment through strengthened investment planning and coordination; project assessment, selection, and monitoring; better governance; and provision of complementary infrastructure. **Social protection** There are many other challenges, not the least of which is inclusive growth. While poverty in Mozambique has fallen significantly, a 2009 household survey showed that overall poverty rates had stagnated since 2003 at around half the population. Policies to ameliorate this have focused on improving agricultural productivity; creating jobs through improvements in the business environment and training; developing more focused and better designed social protection programs; and preserving macroeconomic stability. However, work remains to be done to refine policy priorities, derive policy actions and sequencing, and measure results. Also, policy coordination to ensure accountability has been lacking in areas that cut across ministerial jurisdictions, and there are significant data gaps that weaken analytical capacity and thus the basis for policy decisions. All of these issues raise questions about how fast and how high Mozambique can rise, but at the same time they point the way to the policy path that could transform the country to realize its tremendous potential.

We weren't humming the tune to pass the time. The lyrics seemed especially relevant to us this year, as we mark the 70th anniversary of the IMF and World Bank and the 50th anniversary of _F&amp;D_. The world has seen a staggering amount of change in the past seven decades. So, with these two anniversaries in mind and with Dylan's ode to changing times in the air, we focused our attention on the transformation of the global economy'looking back and looking ahead. We wanted to address the question, what will the global economy look like in another 70 years? To help us, we turned to some of the sharpest minds in economics.

For the first time in almost ten years, a book by an economist made it to Amazon's Top 10 list. Thomas Piketty's _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ captured the attention of people from all walks of life because it echoed what an increasing number of Americans have been feeling: the rich keep getting richer and poverty in America is a mainstream problem._ _ The numbers illustrate the troubling reality. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 1 in 6 Americans'almost 50 million people'are living in poverty. Recent [research documents that nearly 40 percent of American adults will spend at least one year in poverty by the time they reach 60. During 1968'2000, the risk was less than 20 percent. More devastatingly, 1 in 5 [children currently live in poverty and, during their childhood, roughly 1 in 3 Americans will spend at least one year living below the poverty line. Also worrisome is that the poverty rate increased sharply during the recession and has not come down. The rate still hovers above 15 percent despite the ongoing recovery (see Chart 1). Unless the economic benefits of an improving economy are felt more widely, this recovery may well prove neither economically nor socially sustainable. The United States needs more jobs that pay decent wages. In our recent [report on the U.S. economy, we argue that extending certain tax credits, together with increasing the minimum wage, are effective and efficient ways to help the working poor.** ** **Statistics with consequences** Poverty has a self-sustaining nature. People who have been sucked into poverty in the past are more likely to fall back below the poverty line in the future. And, the longer they spend below the poverty line, the harder it is to exit. Poverty also becomes ingrained across generations. Children growing up in poverty often lack the advantages of sufficient nutrition and a stable home. They underperform in school, have limited access to quality health care or education, are less likely to go to college, and find themselves less prepared to compete for the high-skilled jobs that the modern U.S. economy demands. This becomes a vicious cycle that leaves the poor lacking the resources or opportunities to exit. Stuck in low-paying jobs and faced with economic insecurity, the poor become more likely to get detached from the labor market and less likely to make investments in education and job training'which could help them break the cycle. At a macroeconomic level, both labor force participation and productivity suffer as a consequence. Poverty reduction is therefore important for long- term growth, and is essential for both economic and social sustainability in the United States. **Supporting the poor** A good chunk of the poor are unfortunately among the ranks of the unemployed. To lift them above the poverty line will require, at a minimum, greater job creation and stronger economic growth. But this is not enough. There are 10.6 million poor people who have a job, and often head households with children. Modest policy efforts can help change the negative dynamics that poverty creates. Luckily, there are tools that can help and which have a proven track record. In particular, the **earned income tax credit program** is a well-targeted mechanism to address poverty by offering tax refunds to those workers that earn below certain income levels. Eighty percent of the tax credit resources accrue to those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. This tax credit, together with the child tax credit, helps reduce poverty rates among the nonelderly more than any other program (see Chart 2). Expanding the tax credit, especially to those without children, would help lift more workers out of poverty (see Chart 3). And the fiscal costs are very manageable'we estimate less than 0.1 percent of GDP per year. [ An increase in the **minimum wage** would complement the expansion in the earned income tax credit. One negative side effect of a more generous tax credit is that it has the potential to lower pre-tax wages of low-income workers, causing workers to see a reduction in their take-home pay (a more generous tax credit would entice more people to enter the labor force, increasing the supply of labor and pushing wages down). To short-circuit this effect, a higher minimum wage could effectively limit the degree to which the tax credit is able to drive down pre-tax wages. It would also shift some of the fiscal costs of a broader tax credit onto companies (rather than being paid for by the budget). Today, a single parent working full time at the federal minimum wage rate earns $15,080 a year, a level that is well below the official poverty line of $16,057. Moving the minimum wage up somewhat from its current level seems justified. While there is a chance that a higher minimum wage would discourage some employers from hiring low-wage workers, research shows a relatively small effect on employment. **Time for action** The belief that anyone can make it if they get a good education and work hard has been a cornerstone of the American identity. By helping poor families make ends meet, a combined expansion of the earned income tax credit and a modest increase in the minimum wage would bring the United States a step closer to realizing that aspiration.

Many cite the increase in the sales tax this April for this decline. But that is not the full story. Yes, it is true that consumer responses to major tax increases are difficult to predict, and large spending swings are not unusual. We see this pattern in many countries (see chart) including Germany's 2007 VAT increase, which had a short-lived impact. [ But Japan needs to tackle other constraints on growth, such as lifting household and business confidence. In this regard, what is more important for Japan's outlook now are its long-term policies. Abenomics has already made progress in ending deflation and jumpstarting the economy. With the near-term outlook looking increasingly uncertain, the government needs to move quickly on the third arrow of structural reforms. **Abenomics' third arrow holds key for lifting expectations**** ** Japan has announced a large number of structural measures since last year, ranging from raising female labor supply, agricultural and electricity sector reform, to deregulation and market opening. What is needed, however, is faster implementation and a more comprehensive approach to lift expectations'critical for maintaining confidence. Recent IMF staff research (see [Balance Sheet Repair and Corporate Investment in Japan) shows that firms need first and foremost clarity about future growth opportunities before they start to invest. **Businesses need also more prodding to 'unstash their cash'\u009d** One of the most promising untapped growth resources are firms' large cash holdings. Over the last decade, Japan's average ratio of cash holdings relative to market capitalization exceeded 40 percent'more than double the equivalent figure for many other G-7 countries. [ New IMF staff research (see [Unstash the Cash! Corporate Governance Reform in Japan) suggests governance and legal framework reforms could lead to more efficient use of these resources. For instance, raising the number of external independent directors and other measures could raise activity''empirical evidence shows that firms with many external directors rarely hold large cash reserves. The government has already made important strides with recent amendments to the Company Act and the introduction of a Stewardship Code for institutional investors to enhance their roles as shareholders. Adoption of a corporate governance code for firms would be another important measure. **Address labor market duality to help with shortages** Shortages in Japan's labor market are quickly becoming a growth bottleneck. An aging population and limited access to foreign workers are constraining labor supply, while growing demand for skill-intensive services, especially in the health area, is boosting demand. Japan's segmented labor market is ill-equipped to cope. Most jobs in Japan still provide life-time employment (regular employment). But because of past cost concerns, the share of irregular employment with lower growth opportunities and weaker job protection has risen rapidly over the last decade. [ Many highly educated women and younger workers hold these jobs, limiting their productivity growth and attachment to the labor market. Narrowing the differences between regular and irregular employment could reduce these inefficiencies and help supply talent to areas where it is needed most (see [The Path to Higher Growth: Does Revamping Japan's Dual Labor Market Matter?). There are no easy fixes: but tackle Japan's labor market rigidities and you enhance its growth potential. **Abenomics needs to stay the course on fiscal and monetary policy** With the consumption tax increase, Japan has taken a first step towards addressing its biggest long-term challenge'reversing the rise of the public- debt-to GDP ratio at over 240 percent of GDP. This and next year's consumption tax rate increase to 10 percent, would reduce the deficit by about 2 percent of GDP'an important down payment toward restoring fiscal sustainability. Fiscal risks will, however, remain large given the still sizeable future consolidation need of another 6 percent of GDP. To limit the risks of a sudden rise in interest rates, adopting a concrete fiscal strategy beyond 2015 is urgently needed and would afford the government to respond flexibly to downside risks. On the monetary policy side, the Bank of Japan has made great strides in ending deflation for good. With inflation and inflation expectations increasing (chart)'a major achievement' real interest rates are declining and lifting returns on capital investments. [ Exiting deflation would also remove other, difficult-to-measure growth effects, such as widespread risk aversion and investor passivism. We believe that the Bank of Japan's easing policy is appropriately accommodative at the current time. But if progress in raising inflation were to stall, it should act swiftly and expand its asset purchases.** ** Japan's post-consumption tax growth outlook is still favorable. But reforms need to march on as quickly as possible to eliminate key constraints on potential growth, and strengthen confidence. All three of Abenomics' arrows matter, but the structural one is now key.

As the U.S. economy recovers, hirings increase and people are encouraged to look for jobs again. Instead, **the ratio of the adult population with jobs, or looking for one'what's called the labor force participation rate'has been falling, standing at 62.9 percent in July 2014** (Figure 1). [ This represents a 3 percentage point decline since the Great Recession and the lowest rate since 1978. What is more remarkable is that fully one-half of the gains in participation rates between 1960 and 2000'those driven by sweeping social changes such as the post-war baby boom and the entry of women into the work force'have been reversed in the last six years. The equivalent of 7.5 million workers have been lost from the U.S. labor force. **A critical issue for the U.S. economy** The dynamics of the U.S. labor market is perhaps the most critical'and uncertain'issue in economics today. It matters for two crucial reasons. First, the future size of the labor force will be central in determining the pace of U.S. economic growth over the medium term. Second, the extent to which the recent declines in participation rates are reversible will be the principal factor in deciding future wage and price inflation and, as a result, the timing and pace at which the Fed raises interest rates. **Labor's golden era and the subsequent decline** Even before the Great Recession, worker participation had been declining. The 'golden'\u009d era was 1960'1990, when participation rates increased from 60 to 66 percent. This reflected the baby boom generation reaching adulthood and women becoming more fully represented in the workforce. But this boost to the size of the labor force started to fade in the 1990s as the baby boom generation started retiring and participation rates for women began declining. Indeed, since the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the 2001 recession, the labor force participation rate has continued to fall. A mixture of factors is behind the decline. Structural changes, mostly linked to population aging, have been an important part of the downtrend. However, cyclical factors related to the availability of jobs and wage dynamics have also been important, particularly following the Great Recession. **Our recent [study points to aging being responsible for around 50 percent of the decline in participation since the Great Recession, while cyclical forces account for a further 30'40 percent.** The remainder of the post-2007 decline reflects various other forces at work. For example, there has been a significant decline in youth participation. This has been mainly driven not, as some have conjectured, by an increase in college enrollment but, rather, a decline in the number of those students who are also working. In addition, rising applications for disability insurance have played a role. Demographics have meant more of the population is in the over-50s age group where the incidence of disability insurance is highest. Adding to this was the upward spike in applications following the Great Recession. Importantly, even those eventually denied benefits exited the labor force while their application was still pending. **A temporary reversal of the decline** Using detailed state level data, our analysis suggests that** up to one-third of the post-2007 decline in participation rates is reversible**. Over the next few years, this should mean a temporary respite in participation with workers (about 2 million) coming back into the labor market as job prospects improve. However, by 2017 participation rates should again start to decline as the underlying forces of population aging begin to dominate and more-than-offset the cyclical bounce back. **Boosting the participation rate in a sustained way** Despite the recovery so far, the U.S. labor market remains far from normal. The numbers of long-term unemployed are still higher than at any previous peak since World War II (Figure 2). [ And a sizable 'participation gap'\u009d'the difference between the trend participation rate and the actual participation rate'has created other forms of labor market slack, which is when there are more potential workers than jobs (Figure 3). [ Hence,** policies in the coming years should focus on maximizing the potential of the U.S. labor market**. Demographics cannot be reversed but progress can still be made. First, economic policies that get the country growing again will help strengthen the labor market, raise wages, and bring people back into the labor force. Labor supply measures would also help and pay-off over the long haul by boosting potential growth. Key measures include enhancing training and job search assistance programs, so as to raise human capital and productivity. Better family benefits'including more affordable childcare'would allow both parents to continue working and help reverse the downward trend in female labor force participation rates. Finally, immigration reform ought to be part of the solution. To support its aging population, the U.S. could provide greater visa opportunities for high-skilled immigrants. This would not only help boost the size and productivity of the labor force, but also likely improve the government's fiscal position.

At more than 35 percent for most businesses, the Japanese rate is one of the highest among the industrialized countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (see Chart 1). Moreover, at a time when Japan needs to boost economic growth, the corporate income tax rate is generally seen as the country's most growth-distortive tax. [ But can Japan afford a lower its rate? In its latest staff report for Japan, the International Monetary Fund argues that a consolidation effort of more than 6 percent of GDP is necessary over the next couple of years to put the exploding public debt ratio on a more sustainable footing (see Chart 2). This adjustment would reinforce other already planned measures, such as the next consumption tax rate hike to 10 percent in October 2015. How then, can Japan talk about lower tax rates as an engine of growth? [ **No small fry** Revenue losses could potentially be substantial. Reducing the rate by 5 percentage points'without offsetting measures'could lower revenue by some 0.4 percent of GDP. Some proponents of a rate cut claim to have an easy solution to cover this revenue loss by arguing that a lower rate will ultimately be (more than) self financing. Inspired by Arthur Laffer, they believe that reducing the rate would lead to such an expansion of the base that revenue will ultimately increase. A recent[ IMF Working Paper rejects such claims, however. Indeed, our reading of the large empirical literature on corporate tax elasticities suggests more modest effects on the base. For instance, as a consensus estimate, we find that a 5 percentage'point reduction in the rate will raise the level of investment by 3\u00c2? percent in the long run (relative to baseline). A plausible estimate is that between 10 and 30 percent of the static revenue loss from a rate cut can be recovered through these investment effects and other behavioral responses (such as income shifting and corporate financial choices). For Japan, tax elasticities have been historically smaller than elsewhere, so that the lower bound might in fact be more likely. While important, such effects are of course far from sufficient to make a cut self financing. **Need for comprehensive reform** So should Japan delay a tax cut until its fiscal house is in order? We don't think so. Rather, Japanese economists and policymakers need to come up with innovative ways to address the current weaknesses of the corporate income tax rate that deter investment, while maintaining the tax as a key revenue source. Our paper emphasizes the following options: * **_Shift toward a higher consumption tax._** Even when increased to 10 percent, the consumption tax rate will still be low internationally. As a relatively growth-friendly and stable revenue source in an ageing society (see [Keen and others (2011)) further increases may be attractive to finance a lower rate. To address concerns an increase may be regressive, it could be combined with targeted transfers to low-income households, similar to the program the government introduced with the first consumption tax increase. * **_Replace local corporate income tax rates with better local revenue sources._** Almost one third of the Japanese rate comprises taxes imposed by prefectures and municipalities. There are far better local taxes to draw on, such as taxes on immovable property, which are more stable, fairer, and less distortive for economic growth. * **_Eliminate distortions for small and medium-sized enterprises._** The tax system currently encourages small firms to pay wages and discourages them from paying dividends. More neutrality requires reform of dividend taxes and a lower wage deduction in the personal income tax. With less arbitrage, overall revenue can increase and business structures become more efficient. * **_Broaden the base._ **Japan has a very large number of special tax incentives, including for small and medium-sized enterprises. Some are ineffective or create distortions. While streamlining incentives is desirable, the expected revenue yield is limited. Moreover, depreciation allowances and loss treatment are not quite as generous compared with other countries, and cutting them back runs the risk of discouraging investment and reducing growth. * **_Reduce the rate gradually._** An immediate corporate income tax rate cut creates a windfall gain on past investments. A credible pre-announced rate reduction will reduce such windfalls and limit fiscal costs in the short run, while still encouraging investment. **Innovative approaches** Japan should also consider more innovative corporate income tax reforms to either substitute or complement a rate cut. It could, for instance, follow Italy's example by introducing an incremental allowance for corporate equity (ACE)'a deduction at a fixed notional rate for equity increases through either retained earnings or equity issuances'relative to some base year. The incremental allowance does not grant relief on past investment and, therefore, incurs little fiscal cost in the short run and grants no windfall gains. Still, incremental investment is significantly encouraged. This is exactly what Japan needs. The allowance has further appeal in that it eliminates the inherent tax discrimination in favor of debt over equity. It is for these neutrality properties that allowance has become the 'love baby'\u009d of public finance economists. Recent experiences in Italy and Belgium are encouraging regarding their practical implementation. Fiscal constraints are acute in Japan. But so is the need for boosting growth. Hence tax reforms should aim to maximize the growth effect per yen of tax relief granted. That may require unconventional policy. Indeed, scarcity should provoke innovation 'in tax policy as much as in any other field.

A deterioration in the conflict, with or even without a further escalation of sanctions and counter-sanctions, could have a substantial adverse impact on the Russian economy through direct and indirect (confidence) channels. **Chart 1** [ What would be the repercussions for the rest of Europe if there were to be disruptions in trade or financial flows with Russia, or if economic growth in Russia were to take a sharp downturn? To understand which countries in Europe might be most affected, we looked at the broad channels by which they are connected to Russia'their trade, energy, investment, and financial ties. See also separate [blog on Russia-Caucasus and Central Asia links. We find that Eastern European countries have the closest links with Russia and some of them could be seriously affected by a sharp slowdown of the Russian economy or a ratcheting up of sanctions and countersanctions. Western European countries are relatively less linked but some could also see significant effects. These conclusions, of course, are based broadly on the potential channels rather than a quantification of the potential impact, which anyway could be dominated by confidence effects from geopolitical tensions. **Trade links **_ _ For most European countries, Russia is not a major export market (Chart 2). Therefore, slower growth in Russia would probably not hurt them too much. However, for many of Russia's immediate neighbors such as Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltics, whose exports to Russia exceed 5 percent of their respective GDP, the impact could be substantial. **Chart 2** [ But European countries depend more on Russia on the import side'particularly gas and oil (Chart 3)_._ Moreover, in some countries certain industries'such as chemicals and minerals, metals, and manufacturing equipment'rely heavily on inputs from Russia. These industries stand to face a disproportionate impact if there are trade disruptions or price increases on energy imports from Russia. **Chart 3** [ **Energy supply ** Europe relies on Russian gas, importing over one third of its natural gas from Russia through several major pipelines (the dotted line on the map is the planned South Stream gas pipeline). Russian gas accounts for over 50 percent of total gas consumption in virtually all countries in Eastern Europe and several advanced economies in Europe as well (Chart 4). However, as a share of total energy'rather than gas'consumption, Russian gas is somewhat less critical but still very important for several countries and especially so for Belarus and Moldova (Chart 5). In the event of a price increase or disruption in gas supplies from Russia, countries' ability to access alternative suppliers or energy sources will vary. For some countries, particularly those whose energy infrastructure is less nimble and whose gas inventories are relatively low, the transition could take longer and be more consequential. For example, the pipeline via Ukraine has the largest capacity and transports almost half of Europe's gas imports from Russia, and so any disruption in the flow through that particular pipeline would have potentially serious effects on countries whose energy infrastructure relies heavily on it. Many European countries also depend heavily on oil imports from Russia, but those are easier to substitute from other suppliers than gas imports. **Chart 4** [ **Chart 5**** ** **[** **Investment flows** Foreign direct investment (FDI) from Russia, in industries such as banking, energy, and metal and mining, exceeds 5 percent of GDP for Belarus, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Montenegro (Chart 6).** ** **Chart 6**** ** [ A number of advanced economies, notably Netherlands and Ireland, have significant FDI in Russia as well (Chart 7). Financial centers, such as Cyprus, Luxembourg, also report high two-way FDI flows. **Chart 7** [ **Financial links ** Many Western banks have sizable exposures to Russia. Notably Austrian, Hungarian, French, and Italian banks have subsidiaries in Russia and also lend directly to customers in Russia from their branches outside Russia (Chart 8). For some of these banks, their Russian operations have accounted for a large share'in some cases over one third'of their profits in the last few years.** ** **Chart 8** [ The same Western banks also lend to other countries in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE). In Chart 9, the outer ring shows the largest common creditor countries (and their major financial institutions) which account for 60 percent of the total cross-border lending to the CESEE region. In the middle are the recipients, with Russia accounting for about one third of the region's total borrowing from these creditors. Hence, if a large shock to Russia triggers a reassessment of regional risks by common creditors, it could result in a broad pullback in lending to other countries too. **Chart 9** [ Foreign portfolio investments to Russia are also sizable**, **given that Russian assets account for 6'12 percent of emerging market benchmark indices. But there has been little sign of contagion to other Eastern European markets so far_,_even as Russia's spreads widened sharply following developments in Ukraine, spreads of most other CESEE sovereigns drifted lower (see Chart 1). The color-coded maps above can be summarized as follows: [ [ ", "index": 315}, {"pub": "8/1/2014", "title": "Links and Levers: How the Caucasus and Central Asia Are Tied to Russia", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7904", "content": " [By [Alberto Behar (Version in [\u00d0 \u00d1?\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9) The countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) are closely linked with Russia through trade, financial, and labor market channels. These ties have served the region well in recent years, helping it make significant economic gains when times were good. But how is the region affected when Russia's economy slows down? Underlying structural weaknesses have reduced Russia's growth prospects for this year and over the medium term. Tensions emanating from developments in eastern Ukraine'including an escalation of fighting, the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, and new sanctions'have led to renewed market turbulence in Russian markets. Experience has shown that lower growth in a large country can inflict significant collateral damage on neighboring countries with strong linkages of the type that the CCA has with Russia. (See also separate[ blog on Russia- Europe links.) We took a closer look at these connections to see how they transmit shocks, with particular attention to the impact on the region's two main categories of economies'hydrocarbon importers and hydrocarbon exporters (see map). [ **Greater impact on oil importers ** The links between Russia and the CCA are strong and multi-dimensional, we discovered (see figure): * _A special characteristic of the oil and gas importers is their reliance on remittances for household income and foreign currency**.**_ Russia accounts for at least 90 percent of remittances to Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan'and in the case of Tajikistan, remittances are equivalent to half of GDP. Slower growth in Russia means lower remittances: our calculations suggest that a 1 percentage point fall in Russia's GDP could reduce remittance flows to households in oil- and gas-importing countries by 1\u00c2? percent. The presence of very large numbers of workers from the CCA and the remittance channel also means that changes in Russia's visa regimes or labor regulations could have a significant impact. * _Russia also exports goods to the CCA's hydrocarbon-importing countries, especially oil and gas._ As in Western and Central Europe, Russia has a big influence on CCA countries through changes in gas prices or deliveries. After a recently-negotiated 30 percent price discount, Armenia will save about 1\u00c2? percent of GDP annually on its gas bills, a big benefit for the country. * Although CCA commodity exports are targeting the global market, _Russia is still the main destination for goods from job-creating industries like agriculture, garments, and spirits_. IMF calculations suggest a 1 percentage point fall in Russia's GDP could reduce CCA non-oil exports by \u00c2\u00be percent. Moreover, exports may be vulnerable to changes in Russia's application of food safety standards or other non-tariff trade barriers. * _FDI and banking links with Russia are relatively small, suggesting smaller spillovers via these channels._ However, CCA countries do not have particularly strong or diverse FDI or financial sector links with other regions, and the slowdown in Russia and concerns with escalating fighting in eastern Ukraine and sanctions could contribute to region-wide confidence impacts that may also affect the CCA. [ All of these linkages transmit macroeconomic shocks that would have a bigger impact on the region's oil- and gas-importing countries than on its oil- and gas-exporting countries. Our analysis suggests that a 1 percentage-point fall in Russian GDP growth would reduce the oil and gas importers' growth by about \u00c2? percentage point and the oil and gas exporters' growth by less than a \u00c2? percentage point. **Policy implications for the near term** As a short-term response to a temporary shock, such as lower Russian growth this year and next, some CCA countries can reduce interest rates and sustain government spending in order to support the economy. However, the oil- and gas-importing countries have limited resources with which to cushion shocks. Should the need arise, countries could seek policy advice and financial support to help mitigate these potential effects. (Two of the region's oil- importing countries'Armenia and Georgia'currently have programs supported by IMF financial assistance.) Lower medium-run growth in Russia, however, means that CCA growth'and hence tax revenues'will be lower than previously expected. As a result, policymakers in all countries in the region would do well to spend prudently'to avoid a spike in debt in some oil- and gas-importing countries and to limit the drawdown of oil savings in the oil- and gas-exporting countries. **Greater economic independence in the long term** Although the CCA countries have enjoyed strong growth in the past propelled in part by Russia, they'll need to find a new growth impetus as they seek to transition to dynamic emerging markets (see a [recent paper on the CCA). Greater openness to FDI, enhanced connectivity, and more diversified trade are part of the answer. The CCA countries are among the least integrated in the world due to geographical and policy barriers. While the current tensions in the region underscore potential complications to deeper integration, a multilateral approach in which trade barriers are reduced with all countries remains the best option. _With thanks to Brian Hiland and Greg Hadjian for their contribution to this blog post._ ", "index": 316}, {"pub": "7/31/2014", "title": "Too Much At Stake: Moving Ahead with Energy Price Reforms", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7877", "content": " [By [Ian Parry ( Energy plays a critical role in the functioning of modern economies. At the same time, it's at the heart of many of today's pressing environmental concerns'from global warming (predicted to reach around 3'4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century) and outdoor air pollution (causing over three million premature deaths a year) to traffic gridlock in urban centers. In a [new IMF book, we look at precisely how policymakers can strike the right balance between the substantial economic benefits of energy use and its harmful environmental side effects. These environmental impacts have macroeconomic implications, and with its expertise in tax design and administration, the IMF can offer sound advice on how energy tax systems can be designed to ensure energy prices fully reflect adverse environmental impacts. We do this by developing a sensible and reasonably simple way to quantify environmental damages and applying it, in over 150 countries, to show what these environmental damages are likely to imply for efficient taxes on coal, natural gas, gasoline, and road diesel. For example, the human health damages from air pollution are calculated by estimating how many people are exposed to power plant and vehicle emissions in different countries and how this exposure increases the risk of various (e.g., heart and lung) diseases. Although there are some inescapable controversies in this approach (e.g., concerning the valuation of global warming damages or how people in different countries value health risks), the methodology is flexible enough to easily accommodate alternative viewpoints'it is a starting point for debate, not a final point of arrival. **Not all taxes are bad** The world's finance ministers should recognize they have some fairly potent tools at their disposal. Let's face it, taxes can be a powerful way to point consumers and firms away from certain products'look at what's happened with cigarettes in many countries over the past 50 years. Environmental taxes or similar pricing instruments can help in 'getting prices right,'\u009d that is, reflecting environmental side effects in energy prices. We need to focus on smarter taxes, not higher taxes. If properly targeted at the source of environmental harm, these instruments provide the most effective way to reduce the harmful side effects of energy consumption. And their revenues allow governments to lower other burdensome taxes, or meet fiscal objectives more efficiently, thereby achieving better environmental and health outcomes while limiting any adverse impact on macroeconomic performance. In short, countries need not wait on international action to move ahead with energy price reforms, given the large domestic environmental and fiscal benefits. Finance ministers have a central role to play in all this, both in administration, and in restructuring the tax system away from taxes that are likely to be most harmful for efficiency and growth, such as income taxes, in favor of carefully designed energy taxes. But we need to pay careful attention to what should be taxed (the 'tax base'\u009d) and how much should be paid via tax rates. **Getting bases and rates right**** ** As for tax bases, although there are different options, carbon emissions are most easily priced through levies on fossil fuel suppliers in proportion to the fuel's carbon content, building off existing motor fuel taxes. Similar charges on fuel supply can be levied for local air pollution, though providing credits or refunds for capturing emissions'as sulfur dioxide 'scrubbing'\u009d technologies do at power plants'is important, because it is net emissions released into the atmosphere that matter for environmental damages. For motor vehicles, charges on kilometers driven (varying with different urban road classes and time of day) can most effectively reduce congestion, and should be feasible for the longer term'but a reasonable interim step is to reflect all harmful environmental effects (most importantly: carbon, pollution, congestion, and accident risks drivers pose for other road users) in fuel taxes. As regards tax rates, these need to be set in line with environmental damages, to provide an automatic gatekeeper, ensuring that only those environmental improvements are made for which the benefits exceed the costs. **To get it right, price it right**** ** A robust finding in the book is that fuels are pervasively, and substantially, under-taxed. But the degree of undercharging varies considerably across countries. Take coal, for example, which is essentially untaxed at present, but for which carbon charges shown in Chart 1 amount to $3.3 per gigajoule of energy (about two-thirds of the average world price) while air pollution damages (despite regulations) exceed $10 per gigajoule in countries like China and Poland (with high population exposure to pollution), but are less than $1 per gigajoule in Australia and Chile (where the converse applies). Corrective taxes on gasoline are also substantial across advanced, emerging, and developing countries, but more to reflect the costs of congestion and accidents than air pollution and carbon emissions. [ There is much at stake here'implementing corrective fossil fuel taxes (relative to the current situation) would generate an estimated reduction in global carbon emissions of 23 percent, save 63 percent of fossil fuel pollution deaths, and provide fiscal benefits averaging 2.6 percent of countries' gross domestic product.

We do not know precisely when, how fast, or how far, but we do know the direction. After a long period of very low interest rates following the global financial crisis, some central banks (mainly, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England) are planning to 'normalize'\u009d'that is, to gradually tighten their easy monetary policies as their economies improve. And when U.S. and U.K benchmark interest rates go up, interest rates tend to go up elsewhere, too. So should we worry if and when global financial conditions tighten? The [2014 IMF Spillover Report prepared by IMF staff looks into this important issue'what to watch out for and who to watch out for as interest rates begin to normalize. The answer depends on two sets of factors. First, what is going on in the_ originating source_ countries in terms of the underlying drivers behind higher yields'for example, whether or not stronger growth, say in the U.S. and U.K., is the main force behind higher interest rates. Second, what is going on in the_ receiving _countries'that is, how vulnerable they might be to higher borrowing costs. Both these factors matter for spillovers as highlighted in the report. **Factors that drive yields higher**'**good and bad spillovers** Higher interest rates and exit from monetary stimulus in major advanced economies when led by stronger growth prospects (real shocks) produce good spillovers. Interest rates tend to rise elsewhere. But they are lifted by a rising tide of economic activity at home and abroad. Another positive development is that trade and capital flows tend to strengthen. On the other hand, when interest rates move up faster than what is suggested by the real economy (money shocks), things can look quite different. Interest rates elsewhere tend to go up more sharply as liquidity conditions tighten in major financial centers. Capital tends to flow out, especially from vulnerable emerging economies. Foreign activity is dampened. Spillovers then tend to be negative. Based on the report's analysis, the chart below shows what have been the main drivers of higher U.S. long-term yields since the taper episode over a year ago. Notice what happened last summer. Against a backdrop of low market volatility, low spreads, and high asset prices, mere talk by the U.S. Fed of tapering its purchases came as a monetary shock or surprise to markets (blue area). Around this turning point, interest rates moved higher quickly. Market turbulence ensued. Negative spillovers were felt worldwide. The problem is that the central bank may have had little choice: if it felt market expectations and risk-taking had become too one-sided, some course correction may have been needed. Whether fully intended or not, Fed communications during the episode have clear lessons going forward. Given an unconventional starting point'low interest rates and large balance sheets'major central banks face complex challenges when it comes to normalizing smoothly. If markets get well ahead of themselves, financial stability concerns may require higher interest rates even if growth is not stronger. With recent market volatility and spreads falling again to low levels and asset prices moving up (some at all-time highs), this is something to watch out for. [ **What else matters for spillovers** On the receiving end, spillovers from higher interest rates depend on local factors too. During the May 2013 taper episode, for example, spillover effects were _not_ all the same. Instead, effects differentiated across emerging economies depending on their fundamentals and policies. Notably, those with higher external deficits or lower reserves, higher inflation or weaker growth were harder hit. Their interest rates rose or currencies fell by more. Moreover, risks can interact. Markets may reassess those economies with weaker fundamentals in the context of rising interest rates and tighter financial conditions. Thus, more vulnerable economies along these lines are the ones to watch out for going ahead. **Bottom line** So should we worry about higher interest rates? Not if stronger growth is the reason. We would happily take it over the alternative of lower interest rates and lower growth. However, the road ahead is a tricky one. Much will depend on how well the normalization process can be managed. That is, how smoothly can we transition along a path to higher growth and interest rates? And, given recent market trends, there may be further bumps along that road. Stay tuned.

House price inflation is particularly high in London (20 percent per year), and it is gradually accelerating in the rest of the country. The recent increases in house prices have been getting a lot of attention, and understandably have raised questions about living standards and whether another 'boom-bust'\u009d cycle has begun. [ The current UK housing cycle raises two important questions. What is driving the rise in house prices? And how should macroeconomic policies respond? Macroeconomic policies should tackle two crucial issues in the housing market: (i) mitigating systemic financial risks during upswings in house prices and leverage; and (ii) encouraging an adequate supply of housing in order to safeguard affordability. In this blog, we discuss how the UK authorities are addressing these two issues and what additional policies may be necessary to manage risks from the housing market. **The current UK Housing Cycle** Historically, episodes of high house price inflation in the UK have been associated with a rapid expansion of incomes and mortgage credit. But the current housing cycle is notably different from the past episodes: aggregate mortgage credit growth has been relatively weak (only 1 percent over the past year), as has gross disposable income (0.5 percent growth in 2013), yet, in spite of this, house prices have been steadily increasing. [ Accelerating prices explain in large part by a structural undersupply of housing in areas where demand is high, compounded by pent-up demand as credit conditions ease and consumer confidence returns. Perhaps because of expectations of further house price increases and a desire to get on the housing ladder, some households are taking larger loans relative to their incomes. The increase in the number of high loan-to-income (LTI) mortgages is more pronounced in London and among first-time buyers. As a result, an increasing number of households are vulnerable to negative income and interest rate shocks. [ **Addressing financial risks from the housing market**** ** The UK authorities have implemented several policies designed to mitigate potential risks from the housing market. First, they have strengthened banks' buffers against housing market exposures by applying more stringent mortgage risk weights and by increasing the provisioning of forborne retail mortgages. Second, they have tightened underwriting standards, for example, by verifying the income of new borrowers. Third, they have refocused the Funding for Lending Scheme toward business, by making household lending no longer eligible for borrowing allowances. More recently, the government has recommended a cap on mortgages with high loan-to-income ratios, addressing the problem of excessive household indebtedness in the financial system, while allowing lenders to have the flexibility to allocate the risk of their mortgage portfolios. The [2014 UK Article IV Staff Report analyzes recent experiences of such 'macroprudential'\u009d measures in advanced economies, and suggests that that caps on debt-to-income (DTI) and on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are potent tools to dampen mortgage credit growth and to mitigate financial stability risks. The effectiveness of these tools is enhanced when they are used simultaneously with additional macroprudential measures. Countries tend to implement macroprudential policies gradually, possibly as a result of the uncertainty of the transmission mechanism of those policies.loan However, if these policy measures prove to be insufficient, then the Bank of England might want to consider an interest rate hike to tighten financial conditions. This would certainly have an effect, but the decision would require weighing the immediate costs in terms of growth and employment against the effects of an increase in financial risks associated with the housing market. **Addressing structural problems of housing supply** The recent trends in house prices ultimately reflect an imbalance between demand and supply. While the demand for housing'measured by the volume of transactions' has recovered to pre-crisis levels, housing supply'measured by housing completions per capita'is lagging. Micro- and macro-prudential policies will only be able to affect the demand for housing, but will not influence the supply for housing and consequently its affordability in the medium and long term. [ Recent reforms in the planning system are contributing to a gradual increase in house building from recession lows, but more is needed to remove the unnecessary constraints and regulations on development. Further reforms to the tax system could encourage a more efficient use of land and provide economic incentives to local councils to grant more building permits, for instance by better linking local fiscal revenues with the development of local projects. It is also crucial to further develop the private rental market sector in the UK, which currently accounts for approximately 16.5 percent of households. Ensuring long-run affordability and addressing financial stability risks requires understanding the nature of the problem'and what can reasonably be expected from different policies. The financial authorities are concerned about the potential for financial risks and have employed new measures to control them. But, notwithstanding recent changes to planning laws, more will likely be needed on the supply side. Ultimately this will require political and social consensus to allow more houses to be built where they are needed.

We have [revised our forecast for world growth in 2014 from 3.7 percent in April to 3.4 percent today. This headline number makes things look worse than they really are. To a large extent, it reflects something that has already happened, namely the large negative US growth rate in the first quarter. But it is not all due to that. It also reflects a number of small downward revisions, both in advanced and in emerging economies. The overall story remains largely the same as before: Advanced economies are still confronted with high levels of public and private debt, which act as brakes on the recovery. These brakes are coming off, but at different rates across countries. Emerging markets are slowing down from pre-crisis growth rates. They have to address some of their underlying structural problems, and take on structural reforms. At the same time, they have to deal with the implications of monetary policy normalization in the US. Let me take you on the usual tour of the world. **Advanced economies** _The United States_ First quarter growth in the US, as currently reported (I would not be surprised if the numbers were revised), was far worse than anybody had anticipated. In retrospect, it seems to be largely due to one-off factors, ranging from an inventory correction to unusually bad weather. Looking forward, US growth for the rest of the year is still forecast to be 3.25 percent and 3 percent in 2015. The main policy issue, at this juncture, is the appropriate speed of monetary policy normalization. Given the unusual behavior of labor participation, and uncertainty about the equilibrium rate of unemployment, assessing the amount of slack in the US is difficult. The current plans, namely the end of tapering later this year and increases in the policy rate from the middle of next year, are appropriate. But the timing of the increase in the policy rate may have to be adjusted, as a function of developments on the inflation and unemployment fronts. A recent report by the BIS has drawn attention to the potential for excessive risk taking in financial markets coming from an extended period of low rates. We agree that, in some financial markets, valuations appear perhaps optimistic. But, overall, we do not see a systemic threat to financial stability, mainly because of lower leverage in both banks and, to the extent we can measure it, in non banks as well. Were the risks to increase however, macro prudential tools should be the right first line of defense. Getting ready to use them should be a policy priority. _The Euro area_ The recovery in the Euro area remains weak, and inflation remains too low. Our forecasts for the Euro area remain roughly unchanged, 1.1 percent for 2014, and 1.5 percent for 2015. These numbers hide, however, differences across countries.

But the underlying rebalancing across economies within the euro area has been highly asymmetric, with some debtors, like Greece, Ireland, and Spain, seeing large current account improvements (sometimes into surplus), while creditors, like Germany and the Netherlands, have basically maintained their surpluses (Chart 1). A set of new staff papers look at the drivers of the improvements in debtor current accounts and the persistence of creditor current accounts, and whether these developments are a cause for concern. [ **A turning point in competitiveness?** Many debtor economies have seen their unit labor costs decline, improving competitiveness and boosting their current accounts. We looked in detail at recent competitiveness gains in euro area debtor economies, finding them to be largely driven by declining unit labor costs ([Tressel and others, 2014 and [Tressel and Wang, 2014). But Greece and Ireland's labor cost declines have been due to a roughly equal mix of declining wages and employment, while Spain's has been due to declining employment (Chart 2). In other words, the bulk of competitiveness improvements in debtor economies has been accompanied by declining domestic demand and rising unemployment. This raises questions about the durability of the current account improvements in these economies: when domestic demand recovers in these economies, will current account deficits re-emerge? [ **Too much thrift?** At the same time, many creditor economies have had large and persistent surpluses, driven by both higher saving and lower investment. We looked at the composition of surpluses and deficits in the euro area ([Bluedorn, Wang, and Wu, 2014). Both private (corporate and household) and public saving in Germany rose over the past decade, contributing to an overall saving rise of 4 percent of GDP (Chart 3). [ Meanwhile, overall investment declined by about 3 percent of GDP, from 20 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 17 percent in 2012. The Netherlands (another large surplus economy) though has seen declines in both overall saving and investment, but the investment decline has been larger (from about 21 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 17 percent in 2012). Breaking it down by sectors, it becomes clear that the Netherlands' larger surplus is entirely due to the corporate sector. Restrained domestic demand (high saving and low investment) is part of the story behind the persistent surpluses in the creditor economies. **Towards a more 'balanced'\u009d rebalancing'\u00a6** Large and persistent surpluses in creditor economies contribute to a stronger euro, making it tougher for euro area debtor economies to adjust. A stronger euro exacerbates the external competitiveness gap facing debtor economies and also contributes to weak euro area inflation (see blog on '[lowflation'\u009d in the euro area). Taken together, these features suggest an 'unbalanced'\u009d rebalancing'it seems to largely rely on anemic domestic demand in debtor economies and restrained domestic demand in creditor economies. They also point to a truism: appropriate adjustment is about undertaking policies to achieve both internal (reducing output gap and unemployment) and external balance (a more sustainable current account). To make the rebalancing more robust, policies are needed to boost investment in creditor economies and structural reforms to raise productivity in all euro area economies (through further liberalization of product and service markets and reforms to make labor markets more flexible). These would raise potential growth across the board and help output gaps close faster. Breaking out of the current 'lowflation'\u009d environment would also ease adjustment, by opening up space for faster relative price changes within the euro area.

The size of its economy is expected to expand more rapidly than the other regions of the world, and its share in the world output is expected to rise from 30 percent to more than 40 percent in the coming decade. The structure of the economy is expected to continue to transform from a narrower manufacturing hub to a group of vibrant, diverse and large markets with a rising middle-class population. The role of the [financial sector is critical in the success of this seismic transformation. Let me explain by focusing on three areas: 1. **Serving the real economy and structural change. **With urbanization, growing trade, and rising demand for communications and travel, Asia needs to invest a lot to meet infrastructure needs'road networks need upgrading, and electricity generating capacity and telecommunications infrastructure lag other regions such as Latin America. Asia has a large pool of savings but'despite potential high returns in the region'most of these currently leave the region. And so a critical challenge is to ensure that there are no impediments to the healthy flow of capital across the region so that savers can find the best returns for their investment and infrastructure financing needs can be met. Securing small and medium sized enterprises access to finance would also support investment. 2. **Serving the demographic shift**. Efficient financial systems recycle savings to where they are most needed'for example from aging populations who are typically saving for retirement to younger ones who have investment needs. For Asia this is particularly important as China, Korea, and Japan have rapidly aging populations, even more so than the rest of the world. Yet others, for example India and Indonesia, have younger working age populations and large investment needs. A growing middle class will also lead to demands for a greater range of financial services. Increasing access to basic financial services by households and firms can also help promote saving, enable investment by households in health and education, assist the market entry of new firms, help improve employment opportunities and so help to create the conditions to reduce income inequality. 3. **Managing interconnections and integration**. As Asia's financial systems become bigger they are also likely to become more complex and interconnected than they are today. Market development, including shadow banking, and increased complexity can also raise risks with a potential for problems to spread across borders with an impact beyond Asia. At the same time big changes are being made to the global regulatory environment that are likely to create a number of challenges for markets and regulators alike, affecting financial flows and the size of banks and shadow banks, as well as prudential ratios and resolution frameworks. **Navigating the transition** Achieving these objectives require careful planning and policy implementation. The good news is that there is rich experience and lessons we can bring from other regions. These experiences suggest a focus on the following areas:** ** * **Broaden the investor base. **To ensure economic and structural transformation Asia needs a more diversified financial system with deeper and more liquid markets, which will require a broader and more diverse investor base, greater involvement of long term investors. Supporting social stability and meeting the financial service needs of a growing middle class in the region, including their retirement and real estate planning, requires longer-dated assets and an asset management industry with a longer horizon. Encouraging a long term investor base would also help build up a stable source of finance for infrastructure projects (for example through unlisted funds) and it would require the development of an appropriate back office support infrastructure. With institutional investors relatively small in most countries, and barriers to investment across borders still high, this will be a long-term process. * **Build more liquid markets**. Local currency bond markets have grown since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and have proved resilient even through recent bouts of financial market turbulence. Even deeper and more liquid bond markets would enhance financial stability, and could reduce the corporate and sovereign risk premia lowering the cost of capital and helping to support economic and structural transformation. A more active role for market makers, development of hedging instruments, including derivatives, and repo and securities lending markets would also help generate turnover and improve liquidity. Improvements in the regulation of securities markets could also enhance the role of equity markets as stable and reliance sources of financing in the future. Other impediments include an embryonic legal and regulatory framework for nonbank financial institutions' shadow banks'and a lack of information provision including pricing transparency.** ** * **Enhance regional and global perspectives**. Increasingly, a regional perspective will be key to address rising regulatory and supervisory challenges as financial systems deepen and become more integrated and complex. Possibilities include forming and strengthening supervisory colleges. Looking more widely, the development of the Asian financial system is likely to increase the potential for impact beyond Asia. So regulators and supervisors, while encouraging innovation, will need to ensure they have good cross border cooperation, adequate regulatory powers to act and stay alert to the risks. And the IMF, with its increased focus on interconnections and global impact, can help to identify the risks including any emerging from changes in global regulatory policy. There are many unknowns, and what we have learned from other regions need to be applied to Asia with care, recognizing many unique characteristics of the region. The IMF is seeking to help policymakers in the region navigate the transition, bringing our cross-country expertise to the table. We hosted a joint IMF'Hong Kong Monetary Authority [conference, The Future of Asia's Finance, in February 2014, and now plan to publish a book. We will drill down more deeply into these topics and give them our continuing attention.

At the outset of the global financial crisis, the IMF for the first time advocated a fiscal expansion across all countries able to afford it, a seeming departure from the long-held consensus among economists that monetary policy rather than fiscal policy was the appropriate response to fluctuations in economic activity. Since then, the IMF has emphasized that the speed of fiscal adjustment should be determined by the specific circumstances in each country. Its recommendation that in general deficit reduction proceed steadily, but gradually, positions the IMF between the fiscal doves (who argue for postponing fiscal adjustment altogether) and the fiscal hawks (who argue for a front-loaded adjustment). All this is highlighted in a recently released book _[Post-Crisis Fiscal Policy_, edited by [Carlo Cottarelli, [Philip Gerson and [Abdelhak Senhadji, that brings together the analysis underpinning the IMF's position on the evolving role of fiscal policy. The book underscores how the global financial crisis has reshaped our understanding of the role of fiscal policy with topics that include a historical view of debt accumulation; the timing, size, and composition of fiscal stimulus packages in advanced and emerging economies; the heated debate surrounding the size of fiscal multipliers and the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool and more.

Some think QE is not needed; others that it would not work; and yet others that it only creates asset bubbles and may even be 'illegal.'\u009d In its[ latest report on the euro area, the IMF assesses recent policy action positively but adds that ''\u00a6 if inflation remains too low, the ECB should consider a substantial balance sheet expansion, including through asset purchases.'\u009d Given all the reservations, would the juice be worth the squeeze? [ [ ****Q1**. What is QE and how would it differ from other ECB balance sheet expansions?** **A1**. QE at heart is a sustained expansion of a central bank's balance sheet'something all major central banks have done since the onset of the crisis. Against a backdrop of reduced wholesale funding, the European Central Bank (ECB) launched 3-year Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) in 2012, which significantly expanded reserve money as the ECB offered funding to banks against eligible collateral. The hope was that stable multi-year funding would encourage banks to restart lending and support activity. While they did not vanish, concerns about stable funding and liquidity did ease'enough to prompt banks, eager to signal financial health, to start pre- paying LTROs. This undid much of the initial expansion in reserve money. Overall, LTROs prevented worse outcomes but did not actually lift private credit and broad money. [ QE would _differ_ from LTRO-type expansions in that the ECB would: (1) make outright purchases of _longer-term_ assets (longer than 3 years), which have wider and larger effects on interest rates, asset prices and spending; (2) expand its balance sheet at its _own discretion _(not that of banks or others); and (3) _sustain_ those purchases until inflation goals are met. ****Q2**. ****What assets would the ECB buy'public or private, core or periphery?**** ** **A2**. For now, there are too few liquid private assets to sustain QE. The market for securitized bank assets is small, as is the one for corporate bonds. Bank bonds are plentiful and liquid but concentrated. Central banks rarely venture into equities. That leaves sovereign bonds the only viable option. (It would be desirable to further develop markets for securitized assets like mortgages and loans to small and medium-size enterprises; the mere fact of QE can give the needed impetus.) [ ECB purchases should be across the board, not just core or periphery, because the problem of low inflation is across the board. So long as the ECB buys sovereign bonds in pursuit of its mandate and in a way that has nothing to do with fiscal outcomes (e.g., neutrally buying the bonds of _all_ countries according to their share in ECB capital), it can rebut the oft-heard charge that QE violates the prohibition against 'monetary financing of fiscal deficits.'\u009d ******Q3**. **How would QE work?** **A3**. QE is not a panacea or substitute for reforms. But it can push up inflation by raising consumption and investment across the euro area, and support that trend by reviving the supply _and_ demand for bank credit. How? For starters, growth and inflation expectations would rise as the ECB signals resolve to achieve its inflation objective. The ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction announcement has demonstrated the potency of whatever-it-takes signaling. Current demand and asset prices also would be lifted by the prospect of lower _real_ interest rates (as QE reduces nominal interest rates and raises inflation expectations). QE would also trigger important valuation effects. ECB sovereign bond purchases directly raise their prices. The sellers of sovereign bonds'banks, pension funds, asset managers'would need to reconstitute their portfolios with other long-term assets, over time raising asset prices more widely. European equity prices, for one, remain well below pre-crisis levels. [ The significance of higher asset valuations would extend beyond the usual wealth effects: * **_Household and corporate balance sheets_**. Before the crisis, additional debt was used to buy housing and other assets whose values subsequently crashed. Ever since, households and firms have been cutting back consumption and investment in order to pay down debt. This _balance sheet recession_ is illustrated in the charts below, which relate pre-crisis balance sheet stress (an index of the level and growth of debt) to post-crisis demand contraction. Higher asset values from QE, and a lower real carrying cost of debt, can reverse this dynamic. [ [ * **_Supply of bank credit_**. Banks are major holders of sovereign bonds. Higher sovereign bond prices mean higher bank valuations'i.e., higher bank capital. (A back-of-the-envelope calculation: a 50 basis point fall in long-term yields could raise the banking system's core tier 1 capital ratio by 1\u00c2? percentage points). Further, higher private asset prices mean higher values of household and firm _collateral_. Together, these increase the willingness and ability of banks to supply credit. * **_Demand for bank credit_**. The increase in aggregate demand from higher asset values and growth expectations would increase credit demand. Unlike other ECB measures to date, QE also works to restore the _demand_ for bank credit. ******Q4**. **Can QE be effective if interest rates are already low and the system bank-based?** **A4**. As noted above, QE works via banks too. It worked in Japan even though Japanese finance is almost as bank-based as in Europe (83% and 89% respectively). And Japan had even lower interest rates when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) launched its successful qualitative and quantitative monetary easing (QQE) program last year. There is much more space for the yield curve to fall in Europe than there was in Japan. A decline in European yields of 50 basis points at mid-maturities, and more at the longer end, is entirely plausible. [******Q5**. **So why did the ECB stop short of QE?** **A5**. The ECB has been clear that it is open to unconventional measures but also that circumstances do not as yet justify QE. And indeed it would not help if the ECB went for QE with anything less than full conviction. The BOJ's QE program in the early 2000s ended prematurely (before inflation and inflation expectations were durably raised), while that in 2010-12 was too guardedly implemented (in small steps and no clear link to the inflation goal). By contrast, its QQE since 2013 has been whatever-it-takes on size, pointed on goals and timeframe, and has yielded a strong response in inflation expectations. [******Q6**. **What about side effects'asset bubbles and currency depreciation?** **A6**. QE will push banks and others out of safe government bonds to lending to the rest of the economy. That is riskier but it is also the point. While risk-taking and credit growth may grow excessive, this is not an immediate risk, certainly not next to that of too low inflation. So far, credit is still _contracting_ in the euro area (barely positive even in Germany) and there is no evidence of housing/asset bubbles (not even in Germany). If bubbles are blown, targeted macro-prudential measures, which need further development, can be deployed. On the currency, QE would likely weaken the euro. Insofar as this raises demand and traded goods prices, it helps tackle the threat from low inflation. This could be an important channel. But depreciation is not inevitable: rising asset prices/economic prospects due to QE may draw capital and _appreciate_ the euro. _With thanks to Petya Koeva Brooks, Pelin Berkmen and Ali Al-Eyd for their contribution to this blog post._ ", "index": 324}, {"pub": "6/26/2014", "title": "Slowdown in Emerging Markets: Not Just a Hiccup", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7712", "content": " By [Evridiki Tsounta and [Kalpana Kochhar** ** ( Emerging market economies have been experiencing strong growth, with annual growth for the period 2000-12 averaging 4\u00c2\u00be percent per year'a full percentage point higher than in the previous two decades. In the last two to three years, however, growth in most emerging markets has been cooling off, in some cases quite rapidly. Is the recent slowdown just a hiccup or a sign of a more chronic condition? To answer this question, we first looked at the factors behind this strong growth performance. Our [new study finds that increases in employment and the accumulation of capital, such as buildings and machinery, continue to be the main drivers of growth in emerging markets. Together they explain 3 percentage points of annual GDP growth in 2000'12, while improvements in the efficiency of the inputs of production'which economists call 'total factor productivity'\u009d'explain 1 \u00c2\u00be percentage points (Figure 1). [ We also found that the pickup in economic activity in the 2000s compared to the 1990s is solely explained by higher total factor productivity. After exhibiting declines in Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa in previous decades, total factor productivity is now on the rise in emerging market economies in all regions (see our [previous blog for a targeted discussion on Latin America). This is not an unusual development during good economic times. However, the improvements in productivity also reflect some [structural (permanent) factors, such as the reallocation of inputs to more productive sectors and gains from past reforms (including from deregulation as well as trade and financial liberalization). All this is good news for emerging markets.** ** **Lower potential growth** After identifying the causes of emerging markets' strong growth performance in the 2000s, we turned to the question of whether the slowdown warrants a 'doctor's visit'\u009d or if it's just a case of the hiccups that will subside. In a [previous blog, we showed that external factors account for a considerable part of this slowdown, although domestic factors also play a role. Whether the slowdown will persist depends on whether it has been driven by transitory (cyclical) or more permanent (structural) factors. Our study suggests that on average, cyclical and structural factors are equally important in explaining the growth slowdown in emerging markets over the last few years (Figure 2). [ Is this good or bad news for global economy? Well, it implies that some of the slowdown in emerging markets'the cyclical part'would be just a hiccup, and that stronger growth should resume once growth picks up in advanced economies. At the same time, [our results suggest that emerging markets will have more difficulty sustaining the high growth rates of the 2000s in the next 3-4 years, as some of the slowdown reflects lower _potential growth_ and is thus more permanent in nature. Estimates of potential growth rates in emerging markets for the next 3-4 years, at 3\u00c2? percent, suggest that growth would be on average 1\u00c2? percentage points lower than so far in the 2000s, though the magnitude of the impact varies by country (Figure 3). [ Several factors explain the anticipated slowdown in potential growth. First, investment (that is, the growth of the physical capital stock) is expected to moderate, as global interest rates which earlier facilitated large capital flows to emerging markets start to rise and commodity prices stabilize. In addition, natural constraints such as population aging will likely limit the contribution of labor in the coming years. Finally, in countries where external and financial imbalances were allowed to build, growth will have to slow as economies address risks to their balance sheets. **Structural reforms to the rescue** As a result, policymakers in emerging market countries will have to place renewed emphasis on structural reforms to raise productivity, which despite recent improvements remains relatively low compared to advanced economies (see a [recent IMF paper for a discussion of tailored structural reforms). So, where does this all leave us? The slowdown in emerging markets is not just a temporary phenomenon that will correct itself with minimal policy intervention. In some countries, transitioning towards a slower potential growth rate may be desirable if this means moving to growth rates that are more sustainable and balanced. However, in other emerging markets, this may be an opportune time to reevaluate policies and undertake structural reforms that can deliver another period of strong growth, income convergence, and rising living standards.

What lets them do this, of course, are the tax rules that countries themselves set. [A new paper takes a closer look at this issue, which is at the heart of the IMF's mandate: the way tax rules spill over national boundaries, and what this means for macroeconomic performance and economic development. These effects, the paper argues, are pretty powerful and need to be discussed on a global level. **Follow the money** Take, for instance, international capital movements. Though tax is not the only explanation, the foreign direct investment (FDI) positions shown in Table 1 are hard to understand without also knowing that tax arrangements in several of these countries make them attractive conduits through which to route investments. In its share of the world's FDI, for example, the Netherlands leads the world; and tiny Mauritius is home to FDI 25 times the size of its economy. The tax revenues (or absence thereof) associated with the exploitation of gaps in the interaction between national tax systems can sometimes be very large'especially for developing countries. At the broadest level, these countries actually have more at stake than advanced ones, in that they raise a larger revenue share from corporate taxation (Chart 1). While at first glance this may seem like an added advantage of tax-induced FDI, it also constitutes risks. In the IMF's work, we sometimes come across countries in which revenue collected from a handful of foreign companies is large not just relative to corporate tax but relative to all tax revenue: 10'15 percent in some cases. New evidence in the paper shows that these patterns are systematic: developing countries seem to be much more affected by spillovers from other countries' tax systems than advanced economies. This makes them overly vulnerable to taxation changes elsewhere. [ [ **Problems for developing countries**** ** One particular concern for developing countries is how tax treaties cede taxing rights in an attempt to attract investment and jobs. Over the past two decades or so, developing countries have signed a huge number (Chart 2). But the evidence on whether such accords actually deliver the benefits hoped for is, at best, mixed. What we do see close up in our country work is a sometimes significant leakage of revenue through treaty provisions. This has, for some time, led the IMF to urge great care in ceding tax discretion by signing tax treaties'a view that is now much more widely accepted. [ **Spillovers and a tax system for the 21st century**** ** The basic problem in all this is one of spillovers'one country taking decisions with impact on others. These take various and sometimes complicated forms. Most obviously, a low or zero tax rate on income can make country an attractive place into which to shift profits through essentially paper transactions. And that can lead to lower tax bases in other countries: our preliminary estimates, set out in the paper suggest these effects to be both strongly significant and large. To address these and other shortcomings, one has to start by looking at the basic architecture of international taxation. The present framework emerged from the League of Nations nearly a century ago. Since then, the world has been transformed by the growth of intra-firm trade, massively increased importance of services and intangibles (patents and the like), and increased digitalization. Recognizing this, an ambitious [G20-OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) aims to address many current problems. Welcome and crucial though BEPS is, a lively debate on more fundamental reform has emerged. For instance, some have suggested that multinationals should be taxed on a consolidated basis, so that transfer pricing'putting prices on transactions within the group'would no longer be needed; and their total income could then be apportioned across countries based, say, on shares of assets, payroll, and/or sales located in each. [The paper stresses, however, that such 'formula apportionment'\u009d could create significant new problems (and might not, as some have assumed, benefit developing countries). Other fundamental reforms touched on in the paper are still very tentative. Nice though that would be, the Fund has no simple solutions (nor, by the way, does anyone else). But one thing in the emerging debate is certain: these basic questions, and the need for hands-on advice to countries trying to cope with the daily challenges of taxing multinationals, are not going away any time soon. The IMF's experience, mandate, and global membership make its presence in this technically challenging but hugely important policy debate increasingly important.

Banks, striving to maintain provisions to cover bad loans, have had fewer earnings to build-up their capital buffers. This combination of weak profits and a decline in the quality of bank assets, resulting in tighter lending standards, has created [challenging conditions when it comes to new lending. We took a closer look at this relationship and the policies to help fix the problem in our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ because credit is the grease that helps the economy function. The stock of nonperforming loans has doubled since the start of 2009 and now stands at more than '\u00ac800 billion for the euro area as whole (see chart). Around 60 percent of these nonperforming loans stem from the corporate loan book. [ **Resolution of nonperforming loans**** ** There is a need to resolve this large stock of nonperforming loans clogging bank balance sheets. But there has not been much progress to date. The stock of nonperforming loans continues to rise, albeit at a slower pace than before, and banks have sold less than 6 % of the stock of nonperforming loans. Resolution has been hampered by three key factors. * **_Bank financial capacity_**'capital and provision buffers'to dispose of nonperforming loan portfolios given the current gap between what the loans were originally worth and what financial markets think they're worth now. * **_Bank operational capacity_** to handle the quantity of bad assets. * **_Legal system capacity_** to process nonperforming assets'though a number of countries have recently introduced reforms to speed-up debt workouts'and relative immaturity of out-of-court restructuring frameworks in some countries. **Cleanup of bank balance sheets**** ** Policymakers and banks have two other avenues they should pursue. First, banks need to clean up their balance sheets. The ongoing assessment of banks, conducted by the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority is a first step in this process. The assessment needs to be credible, reliable and transparent, and should be followed by remedial actions that are implemented on a timely basis and clearly communicated to the market. In parallel, further actions are needed to fully address the constraints impeding the resolution of nonperforming assets: * Bank supervisors should continue to provide strong incentives for banks to maintain prudent provisioning levels, ensure that provisioning reflects forward-looking expected credit losses, and that a conservative approach is taken to collateral valuation, recovery rates and resolution time; * Banks that are overcapitalized for precautionary reasons need to use capital buffers to deal with losses; * Banks need a specialized capacity to deal with problem loans , either in-house or across different institutions; * Authorities should promote a liquid secondary market for nonperforming loans, for example through regulatory guidance on time limits for bad loan provisioning and retention or requirements to keep rigorous loan-servicing records and security documentation; * Legislators should reform legal frameworks'as has begun in a number of stressed euro area countries'and these should be resourced adequately to facilitate timely resolution of nonperforming assets; * Authorities should step-up efforts to increase debtor awareness of available restructuring tools; * Regulators should help to improve the transparency, timeliness, frequency and harmonization of bank and corporate balance sheets to aid the assessments of bank and corporate creditworthiness. **New sources of credit**** ** Along with measures to facilitate an increase in corporate equity levels, including via targeted measures to encourage debt-for-equity swaps, authorities and markets could develop nonbank sources of credit, including bonds, further. However, officials need to ensure that effective regulation and supervision of nonbank entities should accompany these efforts to avoid building future problems. * Regulators should review existing constraints on nonbank long-term investors acting as lenders; * Officials should promote the listing of bonds by smaller firms; * Regulators should reconsider impediments to 'safe' securitization of loans * Official guarantees may be required, though governments should offer them in amounts consistent with the overall fiscal position of the economy, and structure them to prevent leaving guarantors with poor credits. Euro area policymakers face a daunting task in addressing the legacy debt burden to help complete the transition to an integrated financial system. Without significant policy efforts to address the burden of nonperforming loans, some economies may find they remain stuck in the mire of low profitability, low credit and low growth.

In our recent analysis, we examined the corporate sector in a number of countries and found their rising levels of debt could make them vulnerable. Low global interest rates in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and ample amounts of money pouring in from foreign investors have enabled nonfinancial corporations to raise record levels of debt. [ [Credit was readily available in the aftermath of the crisis, and economic expansion enabled earnings to grow healthily, thus helping to prevent leverage from rising too far and too fast. Recently though, [slowing growth prospects are beginning to put pressure on firms' profitability. Moreover, higher debt loads have led to growing interest expense, despite low interest rates. As a result, the ability of firms to service their debt has weakened (Figure 1). **Vulnerable to a slowing economy** [ These debt servicing pressures have left companies more vulnerable to shocks, such as large withdrawals of foreign capital, geopolitical uncertainties, or a sharp rise in interest rates. In such situations, firms' earnings could be severely dented, while borrowing costs could escalate. [Our analysis of a sample of 15,000 large and small companies in emerging markets suggests that a combination of a 25 percent decline in earnings and 25 percent increase in borrowing costs could amplify the proportion of weak firms and their debt service ability (Figure 2). Such shocks are plausible given that earnings have declined 20'30 percent in the weaker firms, while interest expense rose 10'50 percent in the aftermath of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Within our sample of 15 countries, the debts of highly leveraged and weak firms could increase two- fold by $740 billion, rising to 35 percent of total corporate debt from 17% currently. **Exposures to currency losses** [ Another source of vulnerability stems from firms' exposure to exchange rate risks. External debt has been rising, and now comprises more than one-quarter of total corporate debt in a number of countries. Since the market turbulence in May 2013, currencies have dipped by up to 30 percent, while long term government bond yields have increased nearly 150 bps, on average. Corporations with high foreign currency debts may run the risk of a 'triple whammy'\u009d: foreign exchange losses from debt principal and interest payments; lower revenues; and higher refinancing costs. [ [Our analysis shows that a 30 percent depreciation in nominal exchange rates could erode 20'30 percent of earnings in some countries, even after accounting for natural hedges from overseas earnings (Figure 3). **Are banks vulnerable?** For most countries, the [banking sector appears healthy with sufficient levels of capital buffers. However, lax recognition of doubtful assets and loan forbearance may mask the true extent of asset quality risk in a few countries. In such cases, there is a danger that high corporate loan losses could overwhelm what were thought to be adequate levels of balance sheet equity capital and loan loss buffers. Countries with weak bank provisioning and thin loss absorbing buffers are at risk (Figure 4). **Policy suggestions**** ** The good news is that corporate leverage has yet to reach precarious levels in most countries. As such, preemptive policy actions could help to alleviate systemic risks. Policymakers should focus on a number of issues: * Containing the rapid growth of corporate leverage, particularly in foreign currencies * Implementing stronger [macroprudential policies in countries where large capital inflows have fueled growth * Improving data collection while mandating better corporate disclosure of foreign currency liabilities, and bolstering banks' resilience through active provisioning and the buildup of more capital. In the case of emerging market companies, a stitch in time could save billions.

But is this a cause for much cheer? Or are we watching the same movie again? Recall how after a decade-long boom, house prices started to fall in 2006, first in the United States and then elsewhere, contributing to the 2008-9 global financial crisis. In fact, our research indicates that boom-bust patterns in house prices preceded more than two- thirds of the recent 50 systemic banking crises. [ While a recovery in the housing market (Figure 1) is surely a welcome development, we need to guard against another unsustainable boom. Housing is an essential sector of every country's economy and has systemic implications, which is why we at the IMF are focusing on it not only in individual countries but on a cross-country basis. But the task is difficult for a couple of reasons. First, assessing when house prices are out of line with economic fundamentals is as much art as science. Second, the policy toolkit to manage housing cycles is still under construction. To share cross-country information, analysis on housing markets, and discussions on the effectiveness of policy response, the IMF has launched a [webpage'the Global House Price Watch'that will provide a one-stop shop for our data on housing indicators. This information will be updated regularly, including in the form of a quarterly update to be released in July. The IMF also held a [conference last November, co-organized with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, bringing together experts on the housing sector, and a [second conference, where I delivered a [speech, was held last week, hosted by the Bundesbank. **_Determining a fair price _** Over the past year, 33 out of 52 countries in our Global House Price Index showed increases in house prices (Figure 2). Are these changes moving house prices closer to or further away from economic fundamentals? [ Theory asserts that house prices, rents, and incomes should move in tandem over the long run. If house prices and rents get way out of line, people would switch between buying and renting, eventually bringing the two in alignment. Similarly, in the long run, the price of houses cannot stray too far from people's ability to afford them''that is, from their income. The ratios of house prices to rents and incomes are thus often used as an initial check on whether house prices are out of line with economic fundamentals. What does the evidence show? For the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, where a sufficiently long time-series of house prices, rents and incomes is available, these ratios remain well above the historical averages for a majority of countries. This is true for instance for Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway and Sweden (Figures 3a and 3b). [ [ **Detecting overvaluation more art than science** The evidence on house price-to-rent and house price-to-income ratios, however, provides only a broad indication of housing market valuations. Judgments about housing valuation also require supplementary information, such as credit growth, household indebtedness, lender characteristics, and the method of financing. As part of its regular reports on economic conditions in countries'the so- called Article IV reports'IMF country teams often provide an assessment of housing markets, and are increasingly paying attention to credit growth, along with several other country-specific features of the housing market. In some cases, this more detailed look suggests much more modest overvaluation than indicated by the house price to income and house price to rent ratios. One example of this is Belgium, where the IMF concluded that despite the high valuation ratios, risks of a sharp correction of real estate prices appear contained. These country-specific factors for housing cycles suggest that the policy response cannot be 'one size fits all'. **Constructing a policy toolkit** Regulation of the housing sector involves a complex set of policies'the noted economist Avinash Dixit suggested the acronyms MiP, MaP, MoP to refer to microprudential, macroprudential and monetary policy, respectively. Microprudential policy aims to ensure the resilience of individual financial institutions. It is necessary for a sound financial system but may not be sufficient; sometimes, actions suitable at the level of individual institutions can destabilize the system as a whole. Hence we also need macroprudential policies aimed at increasing the resilience of the system as a whole. The main macroprudential tools used to contain housing booms are limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and sectoral capital requirements (Figure 4). Hong Kong SAR has imposed caps on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios since 1990s, Korea since 2000s, and during and after the global financial crisis, over 20 advanced and emerging economies have followed their example. [ Another macroprudential tool is to impose stricter capital requirements on loans to a specific sector such as real estate. This forces banks to hold more capital against these loans, discouraging heavy exposure to the sector. In many advanced economies'Ireland, Norway, and Spain' and emerging market economies' Estonia, Peru, and Thailand' capital adequacy risk weights were increased on mortgage loans with high loan to value ratios. Though evidence thus far suggests that macroprudential policies are effective in the short-run in cooling off housing markets, it is clear that honing them remains a work-in-progress. Finally, there is the monetary policy, which involves the central bank raising interest rates if they want to cool off the housing sector. While monetary policy could be an important tool in many cases in support of macroprudential policies, the optimal allocation of responsibilities between prudential policy and monetary policy remains a matter of much discussion. What is clear however, is that monetary policy will need to be more concerned than it was before with financial stability and hence with housing markets. The tools for containing housing booms are still being developed. The evidence on their effectiveness is only just starting to accumulate.

On the line is the Minister of Energy, who informs her that the country has struck oil and that he expects revenues from its sale to start flowing into the budget in the coming four years. While excited by the prospects of higher revenues'indeed the average resource-rich country gets more than 15 percent of GDP in resource revenues'she starts to ponder how to use these revenues for her country's development. She is aware that only in rare cases have natural resources served as a catalyst for development; too often they have led to economic instability, corruption, and conflict or what has been termed as 'the resource curse.'\u009d [ Strong domestic institutions play a key role in helping to harness natural resources for development, but her country lacks these institutions and developing them is a long process. What should she do, given that the oil revenues will start to flow in the near future? A[ new IMF study assesses one of the options, namely distribution of the revenue directly to the people of the country. **The case for direct distribution** The Minister remembers reading a [paper by Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian that argues citizens of an oil-rich country such as Nigeria'where institutions are weak'would be better off if all oil revenues were directly distributed to the citizens themselves. The authors' main argument is that mechanisms of direct distribution circumvent inefficient or corrupt budget institutions and foster public demand for government accountability. If resource revenues are distributed to the public and clawed back through taxation, the argument goes, the public will demand accountability for the use of the resources. **Assessing the mechanisms of direct distribution ** With this in mind, the Minister asks her advisor to provide an assessment of the pros and cons of directly distributing the wealth from natural resources to the population. As a first step, the advisor looks at how other countries have responded in similar circumstances. To his surprise, he finds only one instance in which resource revenues are distributed directly, that is, in Alaska. However, the Alaskan approach is underpinned by strong budget institutions and official oversight, and the amount distributed is relatively small'only 3 to 6 percent of per capita income'and the direct distribution is made out of income earned from saved resource revenues. To be thorough, the advisor also looks at the experiences of countries where governments provide cash or in-kind transfers to their populations'including conditional cash transfers, subsidies, and income support programs. He finds that these transfers have proven effective in reducing inequality, but that larger transfers to wealthier recipients might have the unintended effect of encouraging withdrawal from the labor force. He also learns that income support programs have tended to narrow their coverage in order to address the perception that they discourage recipients to work. He studies how entrenched energy subsidies are'despite being inefficient, inequitable, and bad for growth'as citizens see them as a way to reap benefits from resource abundance. Finally, he learns that the use of resource revenues outside the budget process can also fall prey to rent-seeking. **Six key observations** The advisor recognizes that providing critical public services to the country's population without access to resource revenues would be very difficult. Moreover, he knows that the government's ability to claw back resources through taxation is limited, and a comprehensive overhaul of the tax system'while needed'will take time. In this context, he presents the Minister with the following observations: * **First, if the Minister were to consider some type of direct distribution'whether small or large'it must be cast in the context of the overall design of fiscal policy**. Spending and revenue-raising decisions'whether financed by natural resources or otherwise'should be based on the overall macroeconomic position. * **Second, there is little evidence to suggest that shifting the burden of decision making to the private sector'as direct distribution mechanisms purport to do'improves economic outcomes. **The private sector might not be better placed to manage revenue volatility, immediately provide critical social services, deal with resource exhaustibility, and address intergenerational issues of savings and investment. * **Third, there is a risk that direct distribution would hinder the provision of public services.** The share of resource revenues is often quite large compared to the current level of government spending; therefore, shifting sizable resources to the private sector means less money for roads, schools, and social services, particularly given weak tax systems that make it difficult to mobilize revenues from the nonresource economy. * **Fourth, direct distribution may create a culture of dependency on the state and could have a negative impact on labor supply**. The experience with earned income credit programs in advanced economies and with conditional cash transfers suggest this could be an issue if cash transfers were large and reach the better-off segments of the population. * **Fifth, there is no guarantee that direct distribution mechanisms would not fall prey to corruption and political pressures**. Direct distribution outside the budget entails significant risks'as suggested by the experience with extra-budgetary funds in many countries. * **Finally, there may be a role for direct distribution in the economy provided it is relatively small in size and part of the budget framework. ** ", "index": 330}, {"pub": "6/4/2014", "title": "Banking on the Government", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7610", "content": " By [Jesus Gonzalez-Garcia and [Francesco Grigoli (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) Government ownership of banks is still common around the world, despite the large number of privatizations that took place over the past four decades as governments reduced their role in the economy. On average, state-owned banks hold 21 percent of the assets of the banking system worldwide. In Latin American and Caribbean countries, the public banks' share is about 15 percent, with some of them showing very large shares, for instance, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Costa Rica are all over 40 percent (see Figure 1). State-owned banks play an important role in the financial system. They fulfill functions that are not performed by private banks, provide financing for projects that benefit the rest of the economy, and provide countercyclical lending (lending more when the economy is weak). But public banks usually respond to the needs of governments owing to the state's obvious involvement in their administration. As a result, government's participation in the banking system may weaken fiscal discipline by allowing the public sector to access financing that they would not obtain from other sources. In our recent [study, we use a panel [dataset for 123 countries to test whether a larger presence of state-owned banks in the banking system is associated with more credit to the public sector, larger fiscal deficits, higher public debt ratios, and the crowding out of credit to the private sector.** ** **Figure 1. Government Ownership of the Banking System 1/** (Averages 2008-10) [ **Impact on fiscal performance** Descriptive evidence reveals that the higher the government's participation in the banking system, the larger the credit provided to the public sector (see table). With a softened financing constraint, public sector entities can access financing that probably would not be available if the government was not the owner of the lender or that could be obtained only at a higher cost. As a result, countries where state-owned banks have a larger presence may see relatively more credit going to the public sector, as well as larger fiscal imbalances and higher levels of public debt. Also, less financing to the private sector could be observed, implying some degree of crowding out in financing resources. [ Our analysis confirms that fiscal discipline is weaker in countries where the government has an important participation in the banking system. In particular, a one percentage point increase in the share of assets of the banking system that is owned by the government is associated with an increase in credit to the public sector as a percent of total assets ranging between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points. This relationship is also shown in Figure 2. More specifically, the chart shows the majority of the Latin American and Caribbean economies to the right of the 45 degrees line. This suggests that the public sectors of these economies are obtaining even more credit than what the average results imply. **Figure 2. Banking System Credit to the Public Sector 1/** (In percent of total assets) [ Our results also suggest that each additional percentage point in the share of the banking system's assets owned by the government is associated with public debt being higher by 0.2'0.3 percent of GDP, and a larger overall deficit of the public sector by 0.15 percent of GDP. There is also evidence of crowding out of financing to the private sector. An increase in the share of assets of banks owned by the government of one percentage point is associated with a decrease in the share of credit to the private sector (relative to the share devoted to the public sector) of slightly more than 0.5 of a percentage point. **Close monitoring of lending practices essential** Policymakers aiming to attain fiscal consolidation should seek to improve the governance environment in which public sector entities and state-owned banks operate. From a policymaking perspective, these results suggest putting in place objective conditions that promote fiscal discipline. Beyond looking at revenue and expenditure aspects, financing sources need to be carefully assessed, especially if they become captive sources for public entities. Thus, close monitoring and control of the lending practices of commercial banks owned by the government is critical to maintain fiscal discipline.

But which institutions really matter, and to what extent, is less clear. A team of staff at the IMF recently completed a [study, along with detailed [country evaluations, that explores the G-20 countries' efforts to strengthen their budget institutions in the wake of the global financial crisis, and evaluates their impact on fiscal policy. We ask whether strong budget institutions helped these countries to cope with the substantial fiscal consolidation needs that arose after the Great Recession. The evidence suggests that these institutions have indeed been important. **Budget institutions matter** In the study we identify 12 institutions (see figure1) that are commonly viewed as important for the effectiveness of fiscal policy. To be clear, the term 'institution'\u009d is used in a broad sense'it encompasses processes, procedures, systems, legal frameworks, and organizational entities which contribute to the budget process. [ The institutions are separated into three groups: those that help _identify_ the fiscal challenges a country faces, those that help _develop_ appropriate adjustment plans, and finally those that support _implementation_ of any adjustment plan approved by government. For example, the fiscal reporting system can be seen as one of the important institutions for identifying the fiscal difficulties a country may face. If fiscal reports do not cover large parts of the public sector, are not timely, or there are few assurances of the integrity of the data, the fiscal reporting institution is assessed as weak. In this fashion we identified for all 12 institutions criteria that helped us to assess the relative strength of the institutions. **Evidence points to effectiveness of institutions**** ** The 12 institutions were then tested individually, together in the groups mentioned above, or altogether, against a number of indicators of fiscal performance. The graphs below show the most interesting findings. Countries with stronger institutions overall seem to recognize the need for fiscal adjustment, in line with the IMF's assessment of the required consolidation effort (graph a), while countries with strong implementation institutions carry out much more of their announced adjustment plans than countries with weak institutions (graph b). It is also remarkable that countries with strong budgetary planning institutions tend to develop and announce their adjustment strategies more rapidly (graph c), and protect capital expenditure (graph d)'important for long-term growth'more successfully during consolidation. [ [ So are there any caveats to this analysis? Yes, of course. The main ones are that the findings are based on a relatively small group of countries and that the period of investigation was quite short (2010'13). As always, proving causality is problematic in institutional analysis. The analysis also does not identify whether the fiscal policy effort of countries during the period was appropriate for the stage of the economic cycle. Further analysis and confirmation of the results will be necessary in the coming years. **Reform effort uneven**** ** It is interesting to note, however, that countries themselves seem very much convinced that institutions do matter. G-20 countries are all pursuing reforms, especially those under fiscal pressure in the wake of the crisis. Yet reforms have been uneven across country groupings and across institutions. Advanced G-20 economies, especially those in Europe, and those with specific consolidation plans seemed to have been the strongest reformers. Emerging market economies did relatively well on improvements in fiscal risk management and performance orientation, but, overall, there has been a widening of the gap in institutional strength between advanced and emerging G-20 countries (graph e). [ Looking at the type of reforms that have been popular it is clear that independent fiscal agencies, fiscal objectives and rules, and medium-term budgetary framework have been the flavor du jour of budget reforms since the crisis. These reforms have been important in making economic forecasts less biased, fiscal frameworks more credible, and fiscal policy more sustainable. They were also an essential part of making fiscal policy coordination possible in the eurozone. Reforms requiring relatively more administrative or political effort have seen less progress, both in advanced and emerging economies. Changes in fiscal reporting and fiscal risk management have been relatively limited, which still makes it difficult for policy makers and politicians to fully understand the fiscal challenges they are facing. Also changes to intergovernmental financial arrangements'to better coordinate fiscal policy between layers of government'have seen few improvements. Extra-budgetary funds and other earmarks, summarized in the 'budget unity'\u009d institution, still limit budget flexibility in many countries. The country evaluations set out priorities for further institutional reform for each of the G-20 countries but, overall, during the past three years, these countries have made progress in strengthening their budget institutions and these institutions have played a critical role in helping them adjust to new fiscal realities. So bottom line'institutions matter'and G-20 countries would do well to continue to reinforce their institutional architecture for fiscal policymaking.

But export diversification is associated with higher per capita incomes, lower output volatility, and higher economic stability'**relationships that can be tracked using our new publically available dataset, which gives researchers and policymakers access to measures of export diversification and product quality for 178 countries from 1962-2010**. We have looked at two measures of export diversification and their impact on economic growth. One measure captures diversification into new product lines, the other development of a more balanced mix of existing products. Analysis using these measures shows that export diversification in low-income countries is indeed among the most effective drivers of economic growth. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a notable increase in export diversification in low income countries, particularly in South Asia, and a shift from agriculture to manufacturing production in many of these economies. For instance, Vietnam transformed its economy from a low-end agricultural exporter to a successful middle-range manufacturing exporter in less than two decades. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have had more varied experiences with diversification compared to other regions. **For example, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya underwent significant export diversification in the last 20 years, yet many other countries in the region have not.** Typically diversification in East and South Asia has been accompanied by a rapid decline in the share of agricultural exports'from 40 percent in 1965-1970 to 15 percent in 2006-2010'along with a steady increase of the manufacturing sector'from 17 percent in 1965-1970 to 66 percent in 2006-2010. But in Africa, the sizable shift away from agricultural exports has been met with only a small rise in the share of manufacturing exports. All regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, have made significant progress in diversifying their exports across partners. **This trend is related to the ongoing process of globalization and a clear shift in low-income country trade away from the European Union and towards Asia'China in particular' and sub- Saharan Africa. ** **Quality, not quantity** New products and trading partners underpin economic development, and so do quality improvements to existing products. Low-income countries' small economic size and limited potential to exploit economies of scale may imply that the cost of moving into many new products is high, making quality upgrading within existing products a more feasible route to diversify. **To quantify quality upgrading'producing higher-quality varieties of existing products'we developed a new dataset that measures quality for 851 products in almost all countries. ** **The new data show that since the mid-1980s, developing countries in the East Asia and the Pacific region have seen a steady increase in the overall quality of their exports quality**, driven mainly by upgrades in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, sub-Saharan Africa experienced a steady decrease due to limited quality upgrading in the manufacturing sector, coupled with a significant fall in quality upgrading in agriculture. We see particularly rapid quality upgrading during the early stages of development, which is associated with higher growth. This relationship holds strongest in the manufacturing sector. But we also find that ample quality upgrading opportunities exist in agriculture, which is particularly important since in low-income countries, this sector still employs a large share of the population. Therefore it would be a mistake to overlook agricultural development as a means of diversifying production and upgrading quality. In fact,** low-income countries will find that when they modernize and transform their agricultural sectors they can reap substantial gains in both productivity and quality**. For instance, agricultural diversification can support entry into new products and accelerate the transition from subsistence farming to production for the market. **Policies to help diversify the economy** Low-income countries should consider diversification and quality upgrading a fundamental component of their development strategy, given their important roles in enhancing growth. How then can these countries diversify into new products, and upgrade the quality of existing products? Findings from our empirical analysis reveal that a common set of economic fundamentals and policies are associated with various dimensions of diversification. Investment in human capital and infrastructure, institutional quality, financial deepening' increased efficiency, depth, and breadth of financial systems' and proximity to markets are all drivers of export diversification. Economic policies can also encourage diversification and quality upgrading. For example, increasing stability, like Vietnam's push to reduce inflation in the late 1980s, reducing direct barriers to entry, such as the dismantling of the state distribution system in Tanzania, and reforming the agricultural and banking sectors helped promote diversification. However, as our country case studies demonstrated, there is no universal diversification trajectory, and a one-size-fits-all approach to diversification and transformation should be avoided. **The new [Diversification Toolkit provides easy access to highly disaggregated, product-level data on export diversification and product quality, enabling country authorities, policy makers and researchers to conduct more detailed, country-specific analysis.** ", "index": 333}, {"pub": "5/22/2014", "title": "Taper Tantrum or Tedium: How U.S. Interest Rates Affect Financial Markets in Emerging Economies", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7545", "content": " By [Alexander Klemm, [Andre Meier, and[ Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n Sosa (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) Governments in most emerging economies, including in Latin America, have reduced their exposure to U.S. interest rates over the past decade, by issuing a greater share of public debt in domestic currencies. Even so, sudden changes in U.S. interest rates still have the power to roil financial markets in emerging economies. Witness last year's 'taper tantrum'\u009d'when the Fed hinted at the possibility of tapering its bond purchases sooner than previously expected, causing bond yields to rise sharply. Market turbulence has since subsided and emerging market investors have generally become less worried about spillovers from U.S. monetary policy. But what do longer data series tell us about these spillovers? In our latest [Regional Economic Outlook for the Western Hemisphere, we pursue this question from two different perspectives'government bond yields and capital flows. **Impact on domestic bond yields ** Changes in U.S. interest rates can reverberate throughout the global financial system. In particular, rising U.S. dollar interest rates lower the attractiveness of investments in other currencies, putting pressure on emerging market exchange rates and bond prices. Our study focuses on changes in U.S. interest rates that reflect perceived news on the monetary policy outlook. We define contractionary monetary shocks as news that drive up the 10-year U.S. bond yield while depressing U.S. equity prices. Such news could include greater-than-expected inflation pressure, an unexpectedly hawkish policy stance, or rising uncertainty over future monetary policy. In contrast, we assume that positive growth surprises or stronger risk appetite would raise bond yields and equity prices, distinguishing them from monetary shocks.[ How do emerging market bond yields respond to U.S. monetary shocks? Our results suggest that, within a two-day window after a contractionary shock, domestic government bond yields in emerging markets tend to increase, but typically less than the corresponding U.S. bond yield. As Figure 1 shows, the relative sensitivity in emerging markets has averaged about one-half over the past ten years. **First tantrum, then tedium?** However, these sensitivities surged markedly with the mid-2013 taper shock, when bond yields in most emerging markets'and especially in Latin America'responded far more strongly than U.S. bond yields themselves. One factor that may explain this unusual response is the extreme market situation right before the taper shock (Figure 2).[ In almost all emerging economies, longer-term interest rates had hit record lows, fueled by an intense 'search for yield.'\u009d Like an overstretched rubber band, yields snapped back up when the taper shock hit. To the extent that interest rates have normalized since then, new shocks may have more moderate effects, consistent with the dominant pattern over the past decade. Still, fresh bouts of volatility remain a risk. The near-universal rise in bond yields since May 2013 suggests that emerging economies cannot protect themselves fully against external financial shocks. However, markets appear to have differentiated among countries based on fundamentals, penalizing economies with higher external current account deficits and domestic inflation problems[ (Figure 3), such as Turkey, South Africa, and Brazil. This points to the importance of preserving strong balance sheets and credible policy frameworks to bolster economic resilience. **A capital flow perspective** Capital flows provide another lens through which to analyze the impact of U.S. interest rate changes. Our results'based on a large panel of emerging economies since 1990'suggest that shocks to the real U.S. bond rate have a significant impact on capital flows to emerging markets (Figure 4).[ Inflows of nonresident capital decline markedly, falling by almost 2 percent of GDP over six quarters in response to a 100-basis-point increase in the real 10-year Treasury rate. The impact on net capital inflows, while also negative, is more muted, reflecting the stabilizing role of residents, who react by repatriating external assets. Developments during 2013 match this historical pattern quite well in most emerging markets, including in Latin America. Instead of a U.S. interest rate shock, let's consider the case of a positive U.S. output shock. Here, we find that net capital flows to emerging markets increase, despite the associated rise in U.S. interest rates. This finding suggests that emerging economies should have relatively little to fear from an orderly normalization of U.S. monetary policy that mirrors better U.S. growth. By contrast, an independent interest rate increase would likely cause capital outflow pressures. **Shoring up the economy ** Although many emerging economies have reduced their reliance on dollar- denominated debt, there is no complete insulation from U.S. monetary shocks. In a scenario of gradually normalizing U.S. monetary policy, adverse spillovers from rising U.S. interest rates should be contained. For close trading partners, in fact, the positive impulse from stronger U.S. growth is very likely to dominate. Nonetheless, policymakers should stay prepared for renewed volatility. The key to shoring up the domestic economy lies in: * Robust balance sheets that withstand investor scrutiny even at times of acute risk aversion; and * Strong policy frameworks, which will typically include prudent fiscal policy, a credible inflation target, and exchange rate flexibility as the first line of defense against external shocks.

Our [analysis in the latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ suggests that if the U.S. exit is bumpy (Figure 1), although this is a tail risk and not our prediction, the result could lead to a faster rise in U.S long-term Treasury rates that impacts other bond markets. This could have implications not only for emerging markets, as widely discussed, but, also for other advanced economies. [ Indeed, historical episodes show that sharp rises in US treasury rates lead to increases in government bond yields across other major advanced economies. **Some facts**_ _ During the last five episodes when 10-year U.S. Treasury rates rose rapidly, bond yields rose, on average, by 73 basis point in Canada, 66 basis points in the United Kingdom, 60 basis points in Germany, and 36 basis points Japan, for every 100 basis point rise in the U.S. Treasury rate (Figure 2). [ We saw a similar effect when we looked at U.S. Treasury rates' impact on emerging market local-currency bond yields, especially during the selloff in 2013. **Tracking the connection: the term premium is a key channel** Why are long-long term bond yields in advanced economies correlated with U.S. Treasury rates, especially during financial shocks? Why does the correlation vary by country? To answer these questions, we separated bond yields into two components: expected short rates, which expectations of central bank policy rates determine, and the term premium' the compensation sought by investors for potential losses due to interest rate or inflation risk. Our analysis showed that the term premium plays a key role in the transmission of U.S. shocks to other countries. We found that even if expected short rates deviated among countries because of differences in country circumstances, the term premium across countries was highly correlated. Moreover, as with yields, we found the transmission of U.S. term premium shocks to other countries to be the highest for Canada, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Here's why. **Closer: for better or for worse** There are two possible explanations for this correlation in term premia. * **_Financial linkages_**. There may be a 'global price of risk'\u009d that leads investors to price term premium across advanced economy bond markets similarly through arbitrage, especially among countries with stronger financial linkages. Indeed, bond markets of major advanced economies have become increasingly integrated over time. * **_Economic linkages_**. Several studies, such as [this one and [this one, have shown that the term premium charged by investors tends to fluctuate with the country's business cycle: when the economy is doing well, the premium drops, and vice versa. And when the U.S. economy does well, other countries with close economic ties to the U.S. also do well. In effect, this synchronization of the business cycle across economies may be driving correlations in term premium. These two factors could explain why we find a higher correlation of term premium between countries with stronger financial and economic linkages, such as Canada and the United States. **Implications for other countries** * First, a bumpy U.S. exit from its unconventional monetary policy could have an impact on other countries through bond markets, if investors demand higher term premia in the United States. * Second, even if central banks outside the United States can fully control expected short-term rates through forward guidance, a rise in the U.S. term premium could still put upward pressure on long-term bond yields in other economies, including major advanced economies (Figure 3). [ * Third, for countries with highly leveraged balance sheets, the rise in long-term yields could put further pressure on the capacity to service debt and could create headwinds for growth. These highlight the importance of achieving a smooth exit from unconventional monetary policy in the United States. For more on these and related issues, we encourage you to take a look at the current issue of the _GFSR_, which discusses factors that could complicate achieving a smooth exit, and implications of a potentially bumpy exit on emerging market economies in more detail.

[ IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks to Syrian refugee women at al- Za'atari refugee camp in Mafraq, Jordan. Photo: Pool/Ali Jarekjiali Jarekji/AFP/Getty Images I did not start my visit to Jordan in a conference room, but at the Za'atari refugee camp. It is now home'hopefully a temporary one'to over 100,000 Syrians who fled the bloody conflict in their country. I saw firsthand how these refugees cope under extraordinarily difficult circumstances'and how Jordan, the region, and the international community are coming together. It is heartening to see how Jordanian hospitality and determined support from UN agencies and many other aid organizations are preventing a bad situation from becoming even worse. But more help is direly needed. We at the IMF are doing our own part, by flexibly supporting Jordan with a $2.1 billion loan. Syria is not the only issue on the minds of policymakers and societies around the Middle East and North Africa. More than three years after the beginning of political transitions, there is a debate about the region's economic vision for the future. Here, too, we at the IMF are offering our support'not only with money and advice, but also by facilitating a discussion about these important issues across and within countries. This was the idea behind the conference which we organized together with the government of Jordan and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. **A strong and shared vision** It was a unique gathering. Participants came from all countries in the region, as well as international organizations and donor countries. Within countries, attendance ran the gamut from senior policymakers to entrepreneurs, civil society organizations, academics, and youth. Indeed, the nongovernment sector made up half of the 300 some participants. Listening to their debates, I felt that I was witnessing real progress on an agenda for the future of this region. The workshops on the first day of the conference generated a lot of great suggestions. In the spirit of giving everyone a voice, we had created a voting mechanism where all participants'from minister to youth leader could pick their top three priorities. Here are the [results. Let me highlight just a few ideas that resonated with me: * In the macroeconomic area, a clear message was that each country needs a strong and'importantly'shared vision, for that is what encourages buy-in to create jobs and raise living standards. On a more technical level, it is important to change the composition of government spending to achieve more fairness, more efficiency'and ultimately more inclusive growth. This means more schools and less subsidies that primarily help those who do not need it. [ International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaking with students from the Alimate school in Mafraq, Jordan. Photo: EPA/Ali Jarekji/Pool * Creating jobs, especially for the young, is key. Speakers rightly highlighted education systems that result in productive employment, labor market regulations that protect workers without unduly constraining employers, and a better business climate. * Transparency and governance was another big theme. As a former lawyer, I liked the call to strengthen judicial systems and improve the enforcement of rules. The state needs to be accountable to its citizens'for example, by putting budget information online. * Finally, jobs, growth, and fairness require a thriving private sector. This means improving the business climate. There is much to do to move from a system of privileged access and patronage to a system of competition. Let's start with streamlining red tape for setting up firms, improving access to credit, and setting up less punitive insolvency frameworks. **Implementing the reform agenda** [ International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks with a student at Alimat school in Mafraq, Jordan. Photo: Pool/Ali Jarekjiali Jarekji/AFP/Getty Images A particular highlight for me was to welcome at the conference the winners of our [Arab Youth campaign'four impressive young men and women from Jordan, Yemen, Egypt, and Lebanon. It was refreshing to hear their views on how the economies in the region could embrace their generation. So where do we go from here? Ideas are good, and the conference generated plenty of them. Now starts the hard part: implementation. We agreed that this agenda should now be taken forward for each country, taking into account the specificities of that country.

Understanding who they are, how they are different, and how they have moved themselves to the frontier matters for the global economy because they combine huge potential with big risks.** ** **Get to know them **** ** The first thing to note is that some of these countries already have moved to the lower-middle income group. While a working definition of frontier economies is subject to further discussion, broadly speaking, these countries have been deepening their financial markets, such as Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Some also have been able to tap the international capital markets, such as Bolivia, Ghana, Honduras, Mongolia, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Vietnam, and Zambia. Their markets are, however, not as deep and liquid as those of the [emerging markets, but compared to the latter, they offer higher returns and the benefits of a diversified portfolio. **How they got there** Many frontier countries are [growing at a fast pace, in most cases helped by sustained efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability, and by building business-friendly institutions ( Chart 1). These economies have also made significant efforts to lower inflation through prudent fiscal and monetary policy ( Chart 2). [ [[ Most of these countries have made progress in strengthening their policy making apparatus, reducing excessive red tape and lowering trade restrictions. Reforms to change their economic structure have helped them unlock their potential, including [greater weight on the services sector, such as in Tanzania and Kenya. In many countries_, _alleviation of their debt burden over the past decade has freed up money for investments in physical and human capital. Several countries received debt relief under the [Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, but others reduced their debt outside this initiative, such as Kenya, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. These countries have deepened their financial markets at a fast pace'they offer more domestic financial services and products than their peers. Some have attracted international investor interest in their domestic bonds market and several have [issued sovereign bonds in the international capital markets ( Chart 3). [ Access to international capital markets means these countries can attract financing to address gaps in infrastructure, such as roads and railways, which could provide further impetus to growth. But as described below, market access also poses new financial risks that countries need to carefully manage. **Influences from outside their borders** Low interest rates combined with advanced economies shedding debt have pushed investors to search for higher returns on their investments, which has expanded their interest to invest in frontier economies. The quest for resources by emerging economies has contributed to improved terms of trade and a surge in both domestic and foreign investment in resource-rich countries, such as Bolivia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Mongolia. Domestic public investment has increased as the low debt burden, favorable external borrowing rates, and high commodity prices have increased access to private financing sources outside their borders.** ** **Risks and the policies to manage them** These capital flows also mean that frontier economies face a number of risks and policy challenges. * Access to external private capital has brought frontier economies greater market scrutiny and exposed more weaknesses in domestic macroeconomic policies, such as weakening fiscal and external positions. So it is important that frontier economies preserve their hard-won economic stability and fiscal sustainability. * As interest rates begin to rise in the United States and monetary policy returns to normal, capital flows into frontier economies could begin to slow down. Some countries that have benefited from foreign investment in their domestic government bond markets and exhibit significant fiscal and current account imbalances have experienced volatile exchange rates in recent months, and a rise in spreads (Chart 4). [ The [IMF's recent paper on managing capital flows offers a policy framework to help countries manage risks associated with these flows. * The limited size and liquidity of government bonds issued by frontier economies in international capital markets mitigates the risk of a reversal in capital flows. But new issuances could face higher spreads, and maturing bonds could have a hard time finding new buyers. It is thus important to continue efforts to build adequate external reserves, and bolster economic and institutional fundamentals including domestic savings. Further structural reforms, including in the labor and trade sectors [as well as regulation and higher investment, would enhance productivity, and help these countries [move up the value chain. * Even though frontier economies have deeper financial markets than some of their low-income peers, there are still a number of areas for improvement. This includes [deepening of the domestic bonds market to allow more efficient intermediation of financial flows. * We also encourage countries to monitor the build-up in risks and to preserve fiscal and [debt sustainability. Countries should use the proceeds of government bonds for high yielding projects, whether issued domestically or in international capital markets. Frontier economies show great promise, and reforms to their policies and institutions are central to their continued success. They need to remain committed to macroeconomic stability, fiscal and external sustainability, and continued improvements in investor-friendly institutions. Capital flows could be a double-edged sword'policymakers should optimize benefits, but also take actions to address related risks.

Maybe, Maybe Not", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7430", "content": " By [Luc Laeven, [Lev Ratnovski, and [Hui Tong Large banks were at the center of the recent financial crisis. The public dismay at costly but necessary bailouts of 'too-big-to-fail'\u009d banks has triggered an active debate on the optimal size and range of activities of banks. But this debate remains inconclusive, in part because the economics of an 'optimal'\u009d bank size is far from clear. Our [recent study tries to fill this gap by summarizing what we know about large banks using data for a large cross-section of banking firms in 52 countries. We find that while large banks are riskier, and create most of the systemic risk in the financial system, it is difficult to determine an 'optimal'\u009d bank size. In this setting, we find that the best policy option may not be outright [restrictions on bank size, but capital'requiring large banks to hold more capital'and better bank resolution and governance. **Large banks increase systemic, not individual bank risk** Large banks have significantly grown in size, and become more involved in market-based activities since the late 1990s. Figure 1 shows how the balance sheet size of the world's largest banks increased two to four-fold in the 10 years prior to the crisis. Figure 2 illustrates how banks shifted from traditional lending towards market-oriented activities. [[_Source: Bankscope, World Bank Financial Development and Structure Database, and authors' calculations. The loan-to-asset and non-interest income ratios are computed as the average across the four largest banks in each country._ Also, large banks appear to have a distinct, seemingly risky business model. They tend to simultaneously have lower capital (Figure 3), less stable funding (Figure 4), more market-based activities (Figure 5), and be more organizationally complex (Figure 6), than smaller banks. [[[[ _Source: Bankscope and authors' calculations. Data for 2011. Assets are in log billions of US dollars (log assets = 2 corresponds to US$7.4 billion, log assets = 5 to US$148 billion). Number of subsidiaries is in log (1+Number of subs)._ In addition, our study confirms that large banks create most of systemic risk in today's financial system. We measure systemic risk as expected bank capital shortfall in a financial crisis, that is, the bank's contribution to how deep a crisis would be. Large banks create especially high systemic risk when they have insufficient capital or unstable funding. And, large banks create high systemic risk, but, interestingly, are not individually riskier, when they engage more in market-based activities, or are organizationally complex. **Too-big-to-fail and empire building** What drives the size and the business model of large banks? Our study suggests the following: '\u00a2 _Implicit too-big-to-fail subsidies_ (see[ the IMF's recent_ Global Financial Stability Report_). The perception that the creditors of large banks will be bailed out during bank distress, the so-called 'moral hazard'\u009d problem, lowers the cost of debt for large banks. This predisposes large banks to use leverage and unstable funding, and to engage in risky market-based activities. '\u00a2_ Possible empire building._ A relatively high disagreement among analyst earnings forecasts for large banks suggests that these banks are complex, non- transparent, and therefore difficult for outsiders (or even insiders) to understand and control. This entrenches managers and enables them to pursue empire building strategies, leading to ever larger banks. '\u00a2 _Economies of scale._ While a good explanation for the size of large banks, [recent studies suggest that they are modest. The value of the economies derived from the presence of large banks is $16-45 billion per year (for U.S. banking system). That is 0.2% of the $20 trillion U.S. banking system size, and small in comparison to the [estimated US$6-12 trillion cost of the recent financial crisis. **Optimal bank size inconclusive** The evidence that large banks respond to too-big-to-fail and empire building incentives, and in process create systemic risk suggests that banks might become 'too large'\u009d from a social welfare perspective. But there is an important caveat. We know too little about the value that large banks bring to their customers (e.g., large global corporations). The potential for economies of scale in large banks cannot be dismissed. As a result, we cannot draw conclusions as to the socially optimal bank size. And it also implies that outright restrictions on bank size or activities may be imprecise and hence costly. **Traditional bank regulation insufficient for large banks** Our findings have useful implications for designing policy for large banks: '\u00a2 _We need systemic risk-based regulation of large banks. _The usual micro- prudential bank regulation may be insufficient. First, it may not fully reflect the systemic ramifications of large banks' risk-taking, since the same capital or funding deficiencies create more systemic risk when they occur in large banks. Second, it may neglect the distortions associated with large banks' involvement in market-based activities and organizational complexity, since they increase systemic but not individual bank risk. '\u00a2 _Such regulation may take form of capital surcharges on large banks, in line with Basel III._ Our analysis allows quantifying the effectiveness of such surcharges. For example, for a large bank with about $1 trillion in assets, an increase in the capital ratio by 2.5 percentage points (similar to the systemic surcharge in Basel III) reduces its systemic risk by a quarter. And if that increase in capital is combined with measures to bring the banks' involvement in market-based activities, funding structure, and organizational complexity in line with those of medium-sized banks (should this be possible), the systemic risk is reduced by another quarter. '\u00a2 _There is a need for better bank resolution and governance._ Better resolution would reduce 'too-big-to-fail'\u009d distortions. Corporate governance policies should target organizational complexity, deal with high-powered incentives that encourage risk-taking in large banks, and include measures to strengthen risk controls ", "index": 338}, {"pub": "5/10/2014", "title": "From Rabat to Amman", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7415", "content": " [ By [Christine Lagarde (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9? and [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais) Earlier this week, the first stop on my Middle East and North Africa trip was Morocco, which displayed its legendary hospitality and kindness. Located at the crossroads of Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, the country holds so much promise as a dynamic hub for the region. Morocco has remained a model of stability despite a challenging environment'the economic crisis in Europe, political transition in Arab countries, and more. Throughout all this, the economy has proved resilient, and serious reforms are under way. Yet repeatedly during my visit, I heard about the problem of unemployment, especially among the youth. In the Middle East and North Africa, more than 15 million people are currently unemployed. It is a phenomenon that touches all countries and, disproportionately so, people under 25. In Morocco like in most countries, youth unemployment (19 percent) is double that of the average population (9.2 percent). We will discuss this difficult issue of unemployment at our [regional conference in Amman, which starts tomorrow. At 'Building the Future: Jobs, Growth, and Fairness in the Arab World,'\u009d senior policymakers, civil society representatives, private sector partners, and academics will debate the next phase of economic transformation for the Arab countries in transition. **Strengthening the middle** During the Amman conference, we will listen to each others' news, compare our analysis, and assess best practices; no one has yet the magic recipe to fix all these pressing economic challenges. Yet I have little doubt that sustained growth is only possible if a country has a solid macroeconomic foundation based on which confidence can be built, to in turn develop investments and create jobs. Beyond stability, I also think that strong cooperation between the public and the private sectors is indispensable to encourage the creation of growth and jobs, and I believe that an inclusive economy best supports sustainable growth. In a [speech in Rabat on Thursday, I offered a thought: strengthen the 'middle'\u009d in the economy, in society, in the size of government'that is, create more vibrant small and medium-sized enterprises, a stronger middle class, and a government that is neither too small nor too large. Accomplishing this is not easy. As discussed with my Moroccan colleagues, the private sector can play a significant role. But it will only do so in an improved business environment through smarter regulations and more competition, through streamlining conditions for business entry, and through ensuring that small and medium-sized firms have adequate financing. A more inclusive economy also involves (1) the right conditions for more youth and women to enter the job market; (2) education that matches students' skills with the needs of modern business; and (3) better functioning labor markets. Raising the participation of women in the labor force would result in real gains for the region's GDP. I discussed this point during my visit in Morocco. To my astonishment, I learned from a group of dynamic, passionate women leaders that I met in Morocco that 66 percent of recent graduates are women'and yet only 26 percent of woman actively participate in the labor force. This will change, because such a low ratio, common in many parts of the region, signals a huge waste of resources. One calculation shows that if the gap between male and female labor force participation in the region were only double (rather than currently triple) the average gap in comparable countries, output over a decade would be $1 trillion higher. Finally, a more inclusive economy implies better transparency and enhanced governance. People want to know how the government spends their tax money and whether banks and companies are financially sound. Strong governance is essential, because corruption undermines economic effectiveness, just as it can eventually destroy a society's social cohesion. **Youth perspectives** In the run-up to the Amman conference, we at the IMF conducted a [Facebook campaign to hear directly from Arab youth on how best to create jobs in their countries. We received suggestions from a diverse set of young Arab women and men. Many of them echoed the points I just made'the need for greater investment in the region, a desire for more assistance to entrepreneurs, and the urgency of stamping out corruption. The confident and articulate students whom I met yesterday at the Universit\u00c3\u00a9 Internationale de Casablanca gave me confidence that the new generation of Arab youth is ready to tackle the challenges ahead. I look forward to discussing these ideas in Amman over the next two days.

Sayeh In my many travels to sub-Saharan Africa, a frequent question on the lips of policymakers is the following: 'Sure, we know that growth has not been inclusive enough and poverty remains high in most of our countries, but what exactly can we do to make growth more inclusive?'\u009d This is an important question that the latest edition of the [_Regional Economic Outlook_ for sub-Saharan Africa takes a stab at. It is well known by now that growth in sub-Saharan Africa for the past 15 years or so has on average been quite strong. What is less well known perhaps is that a number of human development indicators such as infant and maternal mortality, primary school enrollment and completion rates, have also improved (see Chart 1). [ Although one can quibble as to whether the strong growth performance is the main driving force for this favorable outcome, it is fairly evident to me, as a former finance minister, that if you don't have strong growth, you cannot have the necessary revenue to fund clinics and schools, and pay qualified nurses and teachers. I am not saying that progress in these areas is great; it's not. Many countries will not be able to meet the United Nations [Millennium Development Goals, especially that of halving poverty. Thus the fruits of the strong growth have not been shared in a large number of countries. In other words, growth has not been as inclusive as it can be in many cases. Countries can do more to help lift more people out of poverty. Targeted policies can make a difference. **Star performers** To illustrate what I am saying, take the examples of Mozambique and Vietnam. Both countries are star performers that delivered remarkably similar growth in GDP per capita over extended periods. Both countries emerged from prolonged, devastating wars and transitioned from centrally planned economies. There the similarities stop. As Chart 2 shows, Vietnam managed to more than halve its poverty between 1992 and 2004. Sure, Mozambique made considerable progress, but fell well short of what Vietnam achieved. [ So what explains this stark difference? In two words: 'structural transformation.'\u009d Our analysis underscores two ways in which the transformation was achieved in Vietnam. * **First**, there were sustained increases in agricultural productivity in both staple crops such as rice and cash crops such as coffee. As shown in Chart 3, total factor productivity in the agricultural sector in Vietnam improved by 50 percent compared with less than 15 percent in Mozambique over period of 15 years. [ * **And second**, there was significant generation of employment outside the agricultural sector, especially in low-skill manufacturing and services (see Chart 4). [ The slower progress in poverty reduction in Mozambique is due to the fact that the country's high economic growth to a large extent emanates from the so- called 'mega-projects'\u009d'aluminum smelters, coal mines, and such. But these projects typically don't employ that many people as they are capital intensive. Although such projects clearly add to the welfare of the population by contributing to fiscal revenues that help fund public services, including in health and education, they need to be complemented with policies that support an increase in the labor productivity of as many persons as possible. **Bang for buck** Going back to my starting point, which policies then have the biggest bang for the buck in terms of making growth more successful in increasing overall labor productivity, especially at the lowest skill levels, to help reduce poverty? First, it is necessary to maintain macroeconomic, financial, and social stability without which sustained improvements in income and social indicators are simply not possible. Second, governments should create the physical infrastructure and incentive structure that can allow the economy to create more productive jobs. By 2020 more than a third of the working-age population in sub-Saharan Africa will be below the age of 25. Absorbing all these people into productive activities is crucial to avoiding social tensions and political instability. This may require supporting household enterprises, which currently operate largely in agriculture and services, so that they can increase their productivity. For better or worse, this is where most of the people in sub- Saharan Africa are'around 60'70 percent of the population. **Mobile money** Finally, financial inclusion can play a crucial role in fostering more inclusive growth, and allowing more people to escape poverty, notably by promoting savings and removing financing obstacles to entrepreneurial activities. Recent empirical evidence suggests that lowering transaction costs for the poor, such as mobile money transfers, facilitates financial inclusion more rapidly than creating specialized financial institutions. To sum up, I do believe that much more can be done to reduce poverty and make growth more inclusive in sub-Saharan Africa. It's not only a moral imperative; it's a savvy political move, and, above all, a necessary economic one: shared growth is more likely to be stronger and more durable.

In recent decades, trade integration within Asia has increased more than in other regions. In valued-added terms, intraregional trade grew on average by over 10 percent a year from 1990 to 2012, twice the pace seen outside of Asia. Likewise, financial integration within the region has started to catch up, although it still lags behind trade integration. Concomitantly, business cycles in Asia have become steadily more synchronized over the past two decades, with the correlation between ASEAN economies' growth rates almost reaching the very high levels seen within the Euro Area. As outlined in the IMF Asia and Pacific Department's latest _[Regional Economic Outlook, _these facts are related. Namely, increases in trade and financial integration have strengthened the propagation of growth shocks between regional partners, leading Asian economies to move more in lockstep. One driver of this synchronization of business cycles has been the increase in size and connectedness of China's economy. Looking ahead, we expect regional integration agenda and a bigger China to further increase spillovers and growth co-movement across the region. Greater international cooperation, particularly regional and global financial safety nets, can help countries respond to the associated risk of more synchronized, sharper downturns, and thereby help Asia make the most of greater regional integration. **Trade integration has been an important synchronizing force for Asian business cycles** On the trade side, our study brings a novel finding: what makes two economies co-move'by propagating shocks across borders'is the intensity of their bilateral trade in_ value-added terms_, not in _gross_ terms. The iPhone supply chain example illustrates why this makes sense: although China exports the product to the US, its domestic firms add only a small fraction of the overall value added, so that gross exports vastly over-estimate the dependence of the Chinese economy on final demand from American consumers. The reverse holds for Korea or Taiwan POC, which reap sizeable value added through exports of components to China even though they don't export any iPhones to the US. Overall, the trend increase in the value-added traded between Asian economies over the past two decades has accounted for around one-quarter of the concomitant increase in business cycle synchronization across the region. Financial integration has been a more ambivalent force. Across the world, it has magnified the impact on business cycle synchronization of large global shocks like the global financial crisis, as global banks pulled funds back across the board. But in normal times, it has lowered synchronization somewhat, possibly by facilitating international reallocation of capital when a shock hits one country. However, this has been less of a factor in Asia, where cross-border financial claims and flows have so far been comparatively small.** ** **China's rise means larger spillovers and greater business cycle co-movement** A further source of cyclical co-movement is the growing importance of China's domestic demand for the rest of the region. In its (declining) role as the 'assembly hub'\u009d of Asia, China's economy does not _directly_ affect its trade partners much, since it primarily propagates shocks coming from advanced economies through the regional supply chain. But as a growing source of final demand, China now has a bigger direct impact than in the past. Indeed, economies whose trade dependence on China's final demand has increased over the past decade have generally experienced a greater increase in their cyclical co-movement with China. [ Because many Asian economies (such as Korea, Malaysia or Thailand) depend more on China for their exports of final goods and services than exporters in other regions, they would be more affected by growth shocks originating from China. Based on our empirical results, a one percentage point decline in China's growth lowers GDP growth in the median Asian economy by about 0.3 percentage point after a year, compared to 0.15 in the median non-Asian economy.** ** **Preparing for the future** Given the room across the region for further trade liberalization and catching up on financial integration, spillovers are likely to rise and business cycles to become more correlated, particularly during crises. A bigger China, when hit by shocks, will be a further source of synchronization. The main challenge for policymakers will be to reap the major gains from further integration while minimizing the side effects from greater spillovers. International policy cooperation can play a role here. Stronger co-movement means Asian economies would tend to face synchronized downturns and'depending on the nature of the shocks they would face'simultaneous external financing pressures. Self-insurance through further reserve accumulation can help individual countries buffer such shocks, but this approach is costly and does not provide risk sharing between countries. This points to a potential stabilizing role for regional financial safety nets, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) or bilateral swap lines between regional central banks. These initiatives can usefully complement bilateral swap lines with non'regional central banks and the global financial safety net provided by the IMF, which will be most useful in the event of shocks spilling over to the region as a whole'such as, for instance, shocks originating from China.

The crisis there has been years in the making, reflecting deep structural problems that left it vulnerable to periodic funding shortfalls and near the bottom of transition country league tables. Thus, any program to tackle the immediate crisis in Ukraine must inevitably come to grips with this legacy. **[** **Priorities in a difficult setting** Ukraine's recently unveiled economic adjustment program, with financial support from the Fund and the wider international community, takes as given that output will contract and inflation will remain high in the initial phases of the program. This is not a choice. It is the best that can realistically be expected in exceedingly difficult circumstances. [ The program consists of five main elements to stabilize the immediate situation and strengthen the prospects for growth in the medium to long term: * _Exchange rate flexibility_. The hryvina has been allowed to float'a radical departure after years of exchange rate rigidity, falling foreign exchange reserves, currency controls, and high devaluation expectations. A flexible exchange rate is crucial for Ukraine to restore competitiveness and support exports and growth, avoid a destabilizing loss of reserves, and provide a shock absorber for the economy. The central bank will henceforth focus on controlling inflation, initially by targeting the money supply and later by shifting to inflation targeting. [ * _Banking stability_. Recent events have shaken confidence in the system and prompted deposit withdrawals. The central bank will continue to provide liquidity to solvent banks, while working to ensure that banks are well capitalized. This will entail a series of measures to strengthen regulatory and supervisory oversight, facilitate the resolution of nonperforming loans, and''after proper diagnostics of balance sheets''recapitalize banks as needed. [ * _Fiscal policy_. Without measures, the combined deficit of the government and energy utility would have reached an impossible-to-finance 12% of GDP. So a substantial fiscal effort is required to buttress confidence in public finances. Even so, given the weak economy and the effect of the political turmoil on revenue, that planned effort will still imply a _higher_ combined deficit in 2014 than last year, and the deficit will decline only gradually thereafter. * _Energy policy_. Given the government's precarious financial situation, its capacity to supply energy to the population at some of the lowest prices on the continent has become untenable. The price increases for heating and gas are eye-catching'40%-55% in 2014, and a further 20-40% in each of the next three years. But because these price hikes start from a low level, are spread out over time, and include provisions to protect the most vulnerable 25-30% of the population, their impact is less stark than the headline figures suggest. Overall, they raise heating and gas expenditures moderately from 3-7% of household budgets to 5-11%, reduce the deficit of the energy utility by only 1% of GDP by 2016, and recover costs starting only in 2018. [ * _Transparency and business environment_. An important part of the reform effort is to finally come to grips with the lack of transparency that has allowed distortions and rigidities to survive. Thus, Ukraine has committed to diagnostics and actions covering, among other things, the anti-money laundering framework, procurement law, anti-corruption actions, the recovery of stolen assets, and tax administration. **A promising start** No one can predict how the political turmoil will play out or what new forces will be brought to bear on the situation. The risks are manifold, and from both outside (e.g., the conflict with Russia) and within (e.g., the reform effort yielding to entrenched interests). But if Ukraine is to stand any chance of coming through this economically, it will need to muster every last measure of political unity and determination to implement its ambitious economic program. The current government and leading candidates in the upcoming elections have indicated their support for key program objectives and policies, and major elements of the program have been implemented up front. This is a promising start to a still difficult and complex situation. ** ** ", "index": 342}, {"pub": "4/30/2014", "title": "Reducing Risks in Asia with Macroprudential Policies", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=7355", "content": " By [Edda Zoli (Version in [\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6??, and [\u00e6?\u00a5\u00e6?\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa?) Booming real estate markets, rapid credit growth and'at least before the Fed's tapering announcement last year'sustained capital inflows have raised financial stability challenges across many parts of Asia. To address them, policymakers have increasingly made use of macroprudential policies that address the stability of the financial system as a whole rather than that of individual institutions. In some cases they have also resorted to capital flow management measures to counter large capital inflows. As new analysis in the IMF Asia and Pacific Department's latest [_Regional Economic Outlook_ finds, macroprudential policies, especially measures related to the housing market, have helped mitigate the buildup of financial risks in Asia. In the event of sharp decreases in credit and asset prices going forward, however, it may become useful to ease certain of these measures to avoid excessive deleveraging. **Macroprudential policies more extensively used in Asia than elsewhere** While macroprudential measures have become more widespread around the world, Asia stands out. In particular, many economies in the region have been heavy users of housing'related measures, especially caps on loan-to-value ratios (the ratio between the size of the mortgage loan and the value of the house being purchased). Indeed, since 2000 tightening of loan-to-value ratios has occurred more than twice as often in Asia as it has in Central and Eastern Europe/Community of Independent States, advanced Europe, and North America. [ Likewise, while macroprudential policies have generally become more stringent over time in all regions, this has been most striking in Asia. They were most heavily tightened in the pre'crisis boom period during 2006'07, and then again after the crisis as capital flowed back into the region and asset prices soared. Economies that experienced large capital inflows or housing and credit booms (Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand) were the heaviest users. By contrast, Asian economies, which have relatively less open financial accounts, have taken a smaller number of residency-based capital flow measures or actions to discourage transactions in foreign currency than countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. **Some of these measures had a measurable impact on asset prices and credit growth** New empirical evidence on 13 Asian economies since 2000 indicates that housing-related macroprudential instruments'particularly caps on loan-to-value ratios and the taxation of housing transactions'have helped lower credit growth, slow house price inflation, and dampen bank leverage in the region (although the latter effect is fairly small). And while no such effects are found for non-housing related macroprudential policies and capital flow measures, some of these policies may still have boosted resilience to shocks. For example, the measures introduced in Korea in 2010 to discourage foreign currency transactions have been followed by a decline in banks' short-term foreign currency borrowing, thus reducing their vulnerability to foreign funding shocks. Overall, while macroprudential policies are no substitute for warranted macroeconomic policy adjustment, they seem to have served the region well. **Recalibrating macroprudential policies** Macroprudential policies have thus done their job of helping to mitigate the buildup of risks in the upward phase of the financial cycle. Looking ahead, the question that may arise is how they should be used in the event of asset price declines, slowing credit growth, and/or capital flow reversals further down the road. Macroprudential policies were loosened in a counter-cyclical fashion during the 2008'09 global financial crisis. But more experience needs to be gained on whether and how these instruments should be recalibrated as the financial cycle turns. The main challenge for policymakers is to strike the right balance between preserving future resilience to shocks on the one side, and averting asset price collapses and excessive deleveraging on the other side. The rolling back of policies may therefore ultimately depend on factors such as how acute is the downturn in the financial cycle and how strong are local balance sheets, and may vary across different measures. Accumulated capital buffers, for instance, would typically be used to avoid a procyclical contraction in loan supply. This would suggest a widespread adoption across Asia of countercyclical capital requirements and dynamic provisioning in the future could be helpful to foster the buildup of buffers in the upward phase of the cycle. In a downswing of the financial cycle, reserve requirements could also be lowered to release additional liquidity. Whether policymakers should ease housing-related tools and measures to discourage foreign currency transactions is more controversial. But where regulation is currently very tight, there may be a case for relaxing these instruments after assessing the soundness of banks' and households' balance sheets.

This is certainly good news. [ **But an unusual constellation of risks clouds the outlook. **Geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine, more challenging global financial conditions as monetary policy in advanced economies normalizes, and the possibility of protracted weak growth in the euro area could take a toll on the region's growth prospects. As market jitters over Fed tapering intensified, portfolio outflows from the region (excluding Russia and Turkey) exceeded inflows in 2013Q3'for the first time since 2009. This may have been a warning signal that the road to monetary policy normalization in advanced economies may be bumpy for CESEE region. [ **How vulnerable is the region to tighter external conditions?**** ** **The region is diverse**, encompassing 22 countries'Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine. **Most of these countries have greatly improved their current account positions since 2007, but many still have a high stock of external debt and large refinancing needs**. And some have increasingly borrowed in foreign currency and from non-residents, which exposes them to currency movements and sudden shifts in foreign investor appetite, as was evident in May and June last year and again in January of the current year. Empirical analysis in our April 2014 report [link to report] confirms that higher interest rates in advanced economies, higher global investor risk aversion, and tighter global liquidity conditions have been associated with increased funding costs and reduced capital flows to CESEE countries.** ** [ **Most countries in the region rely on a few common creditors (large cross-border banks or global asset management companies) which makes them vulnerable to spillovers through those lenders**. For example, Austrian banks serve as the largest cross-border lenders to the region, on a scale equivalent to over 60 percent of Austria's GDP. A shock to a country in which Austrian banks have high exposure, or a shock in Austria itself, could prompt readjustment of the entire portfolio of regional exposures by Austrian banks.** ** **Faster-than-expected normalization of U.S. monetary policy accompanied by heightened financial market volatility would have a net negative'but manageable'effect on most countries in the region**. Simulation analysis in our April 2014 report shows that a faster U.S. economic recovery, which would presumably accompany faster normalization, would boost growth. However, for most countries, this positive effect could be more than offset by the contractionary impact of tighter global monetary conditions and financial market volatility. ** ** [ **Taking steps to safeguard the recovery**** ** **Bigger buffers matter a great deal in reducing the effects of external shocks and unlocking higher growth potential. **Better domestic fundamentals'such as higher economic growth potential and lower fiscal and current account deficits'are strongly associated with lower sovereign bond yields, which helps countries better manage their debt burden by allowing them to borrow at a lower cost. On the other hand, less favorable domestic factors'such as higher public sector debt or lower market liquidity'tend to push yields higher. Our empirical analysis also suggests that weaknesses in host-country macroeconomic and banking sector fundamentals (asset quality, profitability, heavy reliance on non-deposit funding) increase the risk of outside lenders cutting back cross-border funding.** ** [ **In the end, strong and measured policies will be essential:** * Countries with exchange rate and monetary policy flexibility should continue to use it as the principal line of defense during episodes of market volatility. * Diversifying funding sources and deepening the local investor base will reduce countries' vulnerability to shocks and to contagion through common lenders. * Rebuilding fiscal space and addressing problems exposed by the crisis'structural weaknesses that are holding back growth and keeping unemployment unacceptably high and high levels of nonperforming loans that are hamstringing credit'will raise growth potential and help to safeguard against external shocks.

Yet in Latin America and the Caribbean, growth will probably continue to slow, although some countries will do better than others. We analyze the challenges facing the region in our latest [Regional Economic Outlook and discuss how policymakers can best deal with them. **Still losing speed** Growth in the region has been on the decline since 2010. 2014 is unlikely to be an exception. Based on our latest projections, regional output will expand by just 2\u00c2? percent, the lowest rate in eleven years'excluding 2009, when the global financial crisis took its toll. The slowdown in investment over the past few years has been even more pronounced (Figure 1).[ We project that not all countries will decelerate in 2014. In fact, Mexico and a number of economies in Central America and the Caribbean are primed to benefit from stronger U.S. growth. Yet the pickup in these countries will probably not be strong enough to offset the slowdown in several of the larger South American economies. **Headwinds from lower commodity prices** One crucial factor weighing on regional growth is the weakening of global commodity prices. Our research suggests that output growth in commodity exporters like Chile, Colombia, or Peru may be significantly lower than during the boom years of 2003'11 even if commodity prices remain stable at their current and still-high levels over the next few years. The reason is that the strongest impulse to growth appears to come from a steady _rise in prices_, not from _high prices_ _per se_. And current forecasts clearly suggest that the period of ever-increasing commodity prices is over (Figure 2).[ A sharper-than-expected slowdown in major commodity-importing economies would make things worse. According to our analysis, a decline of China's GDP by 1 percent relative to baseline could reduce net commodity price indices across relevant countries in the region by between 1 and 8 percent. **Possible turbulence as U.S. interest rates go up** Another factor to watch is the normalization of U.S. monetary policy that started with the tapering of the Federal Reserve's bond purchases earlier this year. Several arguments suggest that the region should be able to manage an orderly normalization of U.S. monetary policy: * Even though policy has started to normalize, we forecast U.S. interest rates to remain relatively low for some time. * The stronger U.S. recovery that underpins expectations of rising interest rates would bolster activity especially in the northern part of the region. * Most governments in the region have significantly reduced their direct exposure to U.S. interest rates, by shifting public debt into domestic currencies. Nonetheless, the market turmoil of mid-2013 provides a warning that the adjustment to tighter external financing conditions could make for a bumpy ride. New surprises to the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, or a general rise in risk premiums could spark fresh volatility and cause capital outflows from the region. Based on recent experience, the most affected would likely be economies with weaker external positions and domestic policy challenges. Specifically, bond yields have risen the most since the May 2013 '\u009dtaper tantrum'\u009d in countries facing a combination of inflation and foreign exchange market pressures, often related to elevated current account deficits (Figure 3).[ **Less fuel in the tank** But not all challenges facing the region are external'domestic factors constraining growth are also at play. Labor markets in most of the larger economies are tight, suggesting less space for output to grow. Significant infrastructure bottlenecks (such as congested roads and ports) and long-standing underperformance of education systems further heighten this challenge in many countries. (Figure 4). Without progress in these areas, the region may well continue to lack the thrust for sustained rapid growth.[ **Policies for a successful onward journey**** ** Faced with lower commodity prices, higher external funding costs, and slowing growth, it may be tempting for policymakers to try and boost activity with fresh fiscal stimulus. Doing so, however, would very likely be counterproductive, as most economies remain close to full capacity, and fiscal buffers, if anything, need strengthening to prepare for more adverse shocks in the future. Otherwise, the region might soon lose its recently gained capacity for countercyclical policy again. A more promising strategy is to focus on structural reforms that remove bottlenecks to growth. Priorities include directing scarce resources toward critical infrastructure needs, enhancing educational outcomes, and fostering a business environment that encourages investment and innovation. Meanwhile, credible policy frameworks, flexible exchange rates, and prudent supervision of the financial sector should play key roles in buffering external shocks and maintaining financial stability. With these elements in place, the next leg of the journey for the region has every chance to remain safe and successful, even in more challenging conditions.

Sayeh (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais) Once again, the latest review of growth prospects for sub-Saharan Africa shows that the [region's economy is in strong health. Growth in the region is set to pick up to 5\u00c2? percent in 2014 compared to 4.9 percent last year (see Chart 1). My view is that this growth momentum will continue over the medium term if countries rise to new challenges and manage their economies as dexterously as they have over the past decade or so. So what explains this continued strong growth performance? Apart from good macroeconomic policies in the region, the growth has been underpinned by investment in infrastructure, mining, and strong agricultural output. And favorable global tailwinds'high demand for commodities and low interest rates'have played a major supporting role. [ That said, I do worry about the global shifts that are taking place and what they mean for the region. Unless countries navigate the new environment adroitly, the current growth momentum will slow down considerably. So what are the downside risks to the otherwise favorable outlook? Let me mention four. **Export demand** First, growth in emerging markets could prove less supportive. If growth in these economies slows down considerably, then export demand will decline, especially for some base metals such as copper and iron ore. Countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Zambia would be particularly hit. At the same time, tighter financial conditions in China could reduce the appetite for Chinese companies investing abroad. China has been a major source of foreign direct investment and infrastructure financing for Africa. Second, as advanced economies unwind their highly accommodative monetary policies, global financial conditions will become tighter and countries in sub-Saharan Africa could experience a hike in interest rates and a slowdown, or even a reversal, of private capital flows. But the risks to the growth momentum are not all external. Security conditions remain difficult in some countries. The conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan are exacting a heavy human and economic toll. At the same time, they are having negative spillover effects for the neighboring countries in terms of lower trade flows and higher security outlays. I also worry about high fiscal deficits in some countries. Four years after the global crisis, fiscal policy has remained on an expansionary footing despite a recovery in both growth and revenue. I'll go back to this theme shortly. **Warning signs** The issue of rising fiscal imbalances is worth dwelling on. A number of economic observers have asked the question: are countries heading back to the bad old days of rapid debt accumulation that may need to be forgiven down the line? Are these fears well grounded? We all applauded when many countries in sub-Saharan Africa in 2009 were able to mitigate the worst effects of the global crisis by actively deploying countercyclical fiscal policy, or at least avoiding fiscal procyclicality. When revenue tanked in the wake of decelerating growth, many countries kept spending up and hence maintained growth. This was quite remarkable as, in all previous global recessions, countries had no option but to do the opposite: cut spending as revenue declined, and hence deepen the impact of the recession. One concern now is that, five years on, many countries continue to show relatively high deficits despite the fact that growth and revenue have recovered rapidly. To illustrate the point, in the years preceding the crisis (that is, in 2004'08), the region saw a fiscal surplus that averaged about 2 percent of GDP (see Chart 2). Between 2010 and 2013, the average fiscal deficit amounts to some 3 percent of GDP, a deterioration of 5 percentage points compared with pre-crisis levels. [ So, what explains the lack of adjustment despite the recovery in growth and revenue? Why has spending kept on growing so fast? **Higher-quality spending** In many cases, increased spending is the result of boosts to public investment and pro-poor spending. And this is exactly what we and others have often been arguing for. After all, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was precisely designed to give countries the necessary fiscal space to undertake socially useful spending in health and education, and rebuild decaying public infrastructure. And, over the long run, higher investment in human capital and infrastructure should raise potential growth sufficiently to pay off the debt, assuming that the quality of spending is high. The solution to every protruding nail is not to hit it down with a sledgehammer. So deficits of the order of 2'3 percent of GDP are probably not a bad thing, and will not leading to rising debt burdens given that GDP growth rates are much higher. And it is true that overall debt levels are not particularly high as of now, and they have been quite stable over the past five years. Overall, public debt-to-GDP ratios have continued to decline, from a regional average of 37 percent in 2004'08 to some 33 percent in 2010'13 (see Chart 3). Debt burdens have been kept in check by relatively high GDP growth rates. [ I am concerned about those countries where fiscal policy has continued to weaken and debt levels have risen rapidly. Particularly vulnerable are countries that depend heavily on portfolio flows to finance their deficits. It stands to reason therefore that to avoid the debilitating effects of a new shock on growth, these countries need to put their fiscal house in order. **Preparing for future shocks** We must first take lessons from the past. Sub-Saharan Africa was able to recover quickly from the effects of the global crisis because most countries started from an already strong position. To utilize perhaps an overused term, they had 'fiscal buffers.'\u009d They had lowered their deficits and slashed their debt-to-GDP ratios in the preceding years. Now is the time to make hay while the sun shines. Countries should aim to increase their resilience to shocks, notably by boosting their revenue base and avoiding excessive spending growth. Countries with large fiscal deficits and high or rapidly rising debt levels should intensify efforts to bring public finances on a more sustainable path. Fast- growing countries should take advantage of the growth momentum to strengthen their fiscal balances. And all countries should strive to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending.

The global financial crisis brought to the fore the question of sustainability of public finances. But it merely exacerbated a situation that was bound to attract attention sooner or later'governments all over the world have been spending more and more in recent decades. Here at the IMF, we've been looking into the factors behind this increase in public spending, particularly social spending, and our latest [Fiscal Monitor report discusses some of the options for spending reform. **Explaining the Growth of Government**** ** How much governments spend mainly reflects a country's individual preferences about the desired size of the government and services it delivers. Yet, over a number of years now, government spending as a share of overall economic output has been on a clear upward trend. Some of this may be due to fundamental economic factors (Chart 1). **Chart 1. Upward Trends in General Government Spending (percent of GDP)** [ The nineteenth-century German economist Adolf Wagner theorized that the demand for public goods and services increases as countries become richer ('Wagner's Law'\u009d). William Baumol provided another explanation, namely that the cost of public provision of goods and services tends to increase faster than productivity; his example was orchestra musicians, whose salaries rise even if they arguably don't play much better than decades earlier ('Baumol's cost disease'\u009d). Our own analysis reported in the Fiscal Monitorprovides evidence supporting both hypotheses. These findings imply that, in the absence of mitigating measures, pressure on governments to spend will continue, though possibly at a slower pace as income and productivity growth level off. In fact, our estimates suggest that, in the absence of reforms, government spending in emerging market economies could increase by between 3 and 6 percentage points of GDP through 2050. And upward pressure on public spending is likely to come from at least two other sources: population aging, which will increase the cost of providing health care and pensions; and the normalization of monetary policy, which will increase debt payments when interest rates eventually start to rise. **Options for spending reform** The main task for governments is to ensure their finances remain sustainable now and into the future while still fostering growth and equity, and somehow do this in the face of the pressures to increase spending. To square that circle, governments will need to strike a delicate balance between tax policy and spending reform. In advanced economies, where consolidation needs are largest and [room to raise additional revenue through taxes is limited, spending cuts may be necessary as part of a wider reform strategy. In many emerging market and low-income economies, on the other hand, large shares of the population lack access to a full range of public services such as education and health care. In their case, there is scope to expand the provision of public goods and services by raising taxes. But some reprioritizing of expenditure is also likely to be needed. Country circumstances and preferences clearly matter and the devil'as always'is in the details, but some common elements emerge from the experience that countries have had with expenditure reform: * _Countries should avoid across-the-board spending cuts ._ Although they may be expedient, such cuts are neither efficient nor welfare-enhancing, and have deleterious effects on the economy's long-term ability to grow. * _Restoring sustainability will require containing social spending and the public wage bill, which together make up the bulk of government spending._ Reining in the growth of social spending requires tackling public pensions and welfare benefits. In the case of pension reform, gradually raising the retirement age, while protecting the vulnerable and expanding access when needed, seems to be the most attractive option. In both advanced and developing countries, improving the targeting of welfare benefits can generate fiscal savings without compromising equity. Reducing the wage bill in a durable way would require replacing the wage and hiring freezes implemented in several countries since 2009 with deeper structural measures. * _Governments can achieve cost-savings by improving efficiency. _The scope for efficiency gains appears to be large in the provision of education and health care and in public investment'the latter is particularly relevant for low-income countries. * _The trend decline in public capital stocks in advanced and emerging market economies will need to be gradually arrested. _Slowing this decline (Chart 2) will require more productive public investment or increased private sector participation. * _Supportive fiscal institutions can boost the effectiveness of expenditure reforms_. Empirical evidence suggests that effective decentralization frameworks and expenditure rules, for example, can help promote spending control. * _Last but not least, __expenditure reforms are more likely to be successful and long-lasting if supported by wide political consensus. _A broad communications strategy is especially important as political uncertainty and social pressures can easily derail reforms. **Chart 2.

The method was alive and well among the moderators, panelists and audiences of the IMF's Spring Meetings seminars that took place alongside [official discussions, where boosting high-quality growth, with a focus on the medium term, was at the top of the agenda. Our editors fanned out and found a couple of big themes kept coming up. Here are some of the highlights. **Monetary policy**** ** Lots of people are talking about what happens when the flood of easy money into emerging markets thanks to low interest rates in advanced economies like the United States slows even more than it has in the past year. At a [seminar on fiscal policy the discussion focused on the challenges facing policymakers as central banks slowly exit from unconventional monetary policy and interest rates begin rising. A live poll of the audience found 63 percent said the global economy remains weak and unconventional monetary policies should remain in place. ['One of the big risks is that we withdraw our accommodative policies prematurely,'\u009d said Charles Evans President, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Evans also stressed that inflation around the world is low. 'I think that's a sign of weakness, and I think that's a sign of risk,'\u009d he said. In a full day discussion of what [monetary policy 's new normal might look like, Axel Weber, Chairman of Zurich-based UBS, said the global economy is returning to normal, and higher returns in more advanced economy markets always leads to a reversal of capital flows, which means volatility for emerging markets. 'So get used to the new normal,'\u009d said Weber. **Emerging economies **** ** What [emerging markets are thinking and doing about this was another hot topic. The U.S Federal Reserve should consider the impact on other countries of its plan to gradually taper its policy of quantitative easing, said the head of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan during a day long series of panel discussions on emerging markets. 'Sensitivity to conditions in emerging markets while exiting would be useful,'\u009d said Rajan, who added that 'what the Fed does now affects what the emerging markets do going forward.'\u009d Others thought emerging markets should equip their economies with the right tools to deal with the impact of Fed tapering, which includes deeper local financial markets that can offer more products, services and liquidity. 'There is no substitute for good, sound policies,'\u009d said Rodrigo Vergara from the Central Bank of Chile. 'We have sound fiscal policy. You might want to try to start a pension fund, but if you don't have sound fiscal policy it won't work. We have deep markets, and deep institutions.'\u009d [In another live poll during a panel discussion, 56 percent of the audience said domestic factors are key to growth in emerging market economies. Liaquat Ahamed, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of _The Lords of Finance_ said the U.S. Federal Reserve does have a key role to play in resolving a liquidity crisis, as it did following the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. 'But that is different from saying the Fed should conduct its day-to-day monetary policy with a view to avoiding spillovers,'\u009d Ahamed noted. In the monetary policy seminar, Adair Turner, former chair of the U.K.'s Financial Services Authority, said that emerging markets and other countries should use [macroprudential policy to guard against the impact of capital flows. 'You can't ask advanced economies central banks to put on a global hat,'\u009d he said. The audience from a seminar on emerging markets earlier in the week begged to disagree. In another live poll, 70 percent said the U.S. should take into account the impact of its policies on other countries. U.S. central bank policy is not the main worry of all emerging market economies. 'The main risk for Chile isn't taper, it's China,'\u009d said Vergara. 'China is Chile's main trading partner and main consumer of their commodities. When you see that credit has gone from 120 % to 180 % you think about a financial crisis. If you're looking for more to worry about in the global economy, you should take Gillian Tett's advice. The Financial Times columnist gave kudos to the recent [_Global Financial Stability Report_ chapter on emerging economies. 'It's jam packed with fantastic statistics and graphs, and scary ones too,'\u009d said Tett. ** Growth &amp; more** [In a [conversation with PBS anchor Charlie Rose, IMF head Christine Lagarde talked about the [global outlook and how policymakers' concerns are now shifting from crisis recovery to creating durable and sustainable growth. To get there, countries need, among other things, key structural reforms in labor markets, infrastructure and other areas. There were also seminars on [Africa, the [Middle East, and [IMF's turning 70 this year that you can watch online. **Inequality** Rising income inequality is now acknowledged as a critical economic, social and economic issue for everyone. [Christine Lagarde is talking about it, the IMF's chief economist [Olivier Blanchard is talking about it, and the IMF has [new research on redistributive policies to curb inequality and the potential trade-off between redistribution and growth. [Speaking on why [inequality should be at the top of policymakers' agendas, Winnie Byanyima, head of Oxfam International, said that 'inequality is morally wrong'\u00a6it is a real threat to democracy.'\u009d 'A consensus has emerged. The IMF says more equality brings more growth. The World Bank says the same. Obama says he cares about inequality. Even God is on our side. Look at what the Pope said.'\u009d The question is, what are we going to do about it?

But the recovery is still modest and measures to boost economic growth and create jobs are important. **Western Europe: picking up the pace** The recovery projected last October for the euro area has solidified. This is reflected in our revised forecasts'e.g., the 2014 forecast for the euro area is up from 1 percent last October to 1.2 percent now, with important upgrades in countries like Spain. These revisions reflect the stronger data flow on the back of past policy actions, the revival of investor confidence, and the waning drag from fiscal consolidation. The positive impact on program countries is palpable'improving economies, lower spreads, and evidence of market access. We've also seen a welcome pick-up in growth in the UK (almost 3 percent is expected for 2014). While stronger growth prospects and market sentiment are welcome, there is still much to do to solidify and pick up the pace of the recovery, not least because unemployment remains unacceptably high in too many places. Unfortunately, the headwinds in the euro area are many. We have previously emphasized the role of debt overhangs in firms and households, of fragmented financial markets, and of policy uncertainty. Action is being taken in all these areas, both at the country level and pan-European level, with steps to Banking Union'the single supervisor, the asset quality review and stress tests'especially important to ensuring the adequacy of bank capital and market confidence. More recently, we have emphasized the role of '[lowflation'\u009d, i.e., of a large and persistent undershoot relative to the ECB's medium-term inflation target of 2 percent. Persistently low inflation puts pressure on debtors, real lending rates, relative price adjustment and jobs. We welcome the attention the ECB is paying to this risk, and its recent statement stresses that it is considering further action, including unconventional policies within its mandate. I would also emphasize the role of structural reforms in reviving longer-term growth, which has taken a hit from several years of under-investment and unemployment. This is the subject of our book, just published on [_Jobs and Growth: Supporting the European Recovery_. Beyond the near term challenges for macroeconomic policy support and deeper integration in Europe, the book focuses on three medium-term priorities: reducing high levels of public and private debt; implementing product and labor market reforms; and taking advantage of new growth opportunities through innovation and further integration into global supply chains. **Emerging Europe: strengthening policies** Growth in most of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe is recovering in the wake of euro area recovery, but growth in the region as a whole will be held back'we have marked it down since last October'by the expected contraction in Ukraine and slowdowns in Russia and Turkey. External funding conditions have also become more challenging. Even before tensions in Ukraine flared, we saw that capital flows into the region had started to reverse, with portfolio flows turning negative in late 2013 (this development comes on top of the on-going bank deleveraging the region has faced). In the near-term, these forces will offset'perhaps even more than offset'the tailwind from Euro Area recovery. Although the reversal in capital flows has hurt most emerging markets, the hit to those with stronger policy frameworks and fundamentals has been less. This underlines the need to strengthen policies. Those with exchange rate and monetary policy flexibility should continue to use it as the first line of defense against volatility. All countries, especially those with weaker fundamentals, need to address legacy issues and problems exposed by the crisis: structural weaknesses that hold back growth and keep unemployment high; non-performing loans that hamstring credit; and exhausted fiscal buffers. **Ukraine** Finally, a word on Ukraine, where we face the very difficult confluence of a geo-political crisis and an economic one. The authorities are showing a remarkable capacity to rise to the occasion, with unprecedented action to tackle not only immediate problems but also chronic ones. This includes action to: * ensure exchange rate flexibility and competitiveness; * stabilize the financial system and confidence in banks; * gradually reduce the fiscal deficit; * adjust energy prices from far-below-world levels (with safeguards for the poor); and * implement wider reforms to tackle corruption, governance and the business climate. There is still work to do to finalize some actions and ensure that the program is financed. If all goes well, we expect our Board will consider the program in late April/early May.

The International Monetary Fund released today a [new paper entitled **'Toward New Horizons'Arab Economic Transformat****ion a****mid Political Transitions.'\u009d** The paper makes the case for the urgency of launching economic policy reforms, beyond short-term macroeconomic management, to support economic stability and stronger, job-creating economic growth in the Arab Countries in Transition'Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen. These countries face the risk of stagnation if reforms are delayed further.Economic conditions have deteriorated from transition-related disruptions, regional conflict, an unclear political outlook, eroding competitiveness, and a challenging external economic environment. As economic realities fall behind peoples' expectations, there is a risk of increased discontent. This could further complicate the political transitions, impairing governments' mandates and planning horizons and, consequently, their ability to implement the policies necessary to catalyze the much-needed economic improvements. How can these countries create jobs, lift growth, and foster fairness? Here are seven lessons from the report: **1) ****There's a need for a medium-term vision to set policies for the economic future.** Countries need prudent economic management, paired with bold reforms to create an enabling environment for private sector'led growth, to safeguard the promise of the Arab transitions for better living conditions and job creation on a meaningful scale. Better economic conditions can then help reduce discontent and thereby smooth the political transitions. **2) ****One size does not fit all. **Individual countries should design specific reform programs based on their starting positions and reform goals. A number of reform areas, however, will be common for them, including deeper trade integration, a focus on business regulation and governance, labor market and education reform, improved access to finance, and better social safety nets.** ** **3) ****Near-term policies need to focus on quickly creating jobs. **Delays in the revival of private investment, in the context of impaired economic confidence, indicate a need for governments to shore up economic activity in the near term. Experience from other countries suggests that well designed infrastructure projects can create jobs and lay a better foundation for private sector activity. **4) ****Fiscal reforms should aim to foster fairness.** Expenditure-side reforms should include redirecting social protection from expensive and inefficient generalized subsidies to transfers that better target the poor and vulnerable. Some countries also have room for raising income tax _progressivity_ and increasing excise and property tax rates, and the closing of tax exemptions and loopholes. Together, these policies would enhance equity while freeing scarce resources for priority expenditure in infrastructure investment, health, and education. **5) ****Budgets need to be anchored in strong medium-term policy frameworks.** In some cases, there may be room to scale up deficits in the near term, when adequate financing is available, but all countries will need to consolidate their budgets in the medium term to buttress economic stability. The slower the pace of adjustment, the larger the financing needs will be, underscoring the need to anchor policies in medium-term consolidation plans that will help secure the continued willingness of creditors to provide the necessary financing. **6) ****Effective communications need to be front and center. **Communications are critical as governments transform their economies. Governments must be able to explain persuasively the reasoning behind difficult decisions if people are to support them. **7) ****The international community needs to step up support.** Even as countries need to stay in the driver's seat and plan their policy programs through wide national consultation, there is a need for the international community to support policy efforts. Such international support can be in the form of finance, technical assistance, or access to trade. **Building the future** This report will serve as an important input to the upcoming regional [conference organized by the IMF, in collaboration with the Jordanian government and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, in Amman, Jordan titled 'Building the Future: Jobs, Growth, and Fairness in the Arab World,'\u009d during May 11-12. The conference, which will be attended by Ministers and Governors from the region, as well as the IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, will provide an opportunity for high-level policymakers, leading private and public sector executives, development partners, civil society representatives, and academics, to enrich the dialogue on the main elements of an economic vision for the 6 Arab Countries in Transition including by drawing on regional expertise and vision, and on lessons from similar episodes of fundamental economic transformation in other parts of the world.

We've had a spate of good news on the economic front recently. Does this mean that we are finally out of the fiscal woods? According to our most recent [Fiscal Monitor report, not yet, as public debt remains high and the recovery uneven. First, the good news. The average deficit in advanced economies has halved since the 2009 peak. The average debt ratio is stabilizing. Growth is strengthening in the United States and making a comeback in the euro area, and should benefit from the slower pace of consolidation this year. Emerging markets and developing countries have maintained their resilience, in part thanks to the policy buffers accumulated in the pre-crisis period. Talks of tapering in the United States have left a few of them shaken, but not (quite) stirred. But there is still some way to go. The average debt ratio in advanced economies, although edging down, sits at historic peaks, and we project it will still remain above 100 percent of GDP by 2019 (Chart 1). The recovery is still vulnerable to several downside risks, including those stemming from the lack of clear policy plans in some major economies. The recent bouts of financial turmoil have raised concerns that the anticipated tightening of global liquidity could expose emerging markets and low-income countries to shifts in investor sentiment and more demanding debt dynamics. **Countries face varied risks** In Japan, for example, the approval of the second stage of the consumption tax rate increase next year remains uncertain, and the government has not yet articulated a medium-term fiscal strategy beyond 2015. In the United States_, _the bipartisan budget agreement substantially reduced near-term uncertainties, but lawmakers have yet to agree on a comprehensive medium-term plan to place the debt and public finances on a sustainable basis. And in the euro area, fiscal risks stemming from the banking sector have not been completely eliminated, and the possibility of a prolonged period of subpar growth is a growing concern. [ Emerging market and developing countries, too, are fiscally vulnerable'albeit to varying degrees. A gradual build up of fiscal and external imbalances, coupled with structural factors, makes many of them susceptible to the emergence of a more challenging global environment. In particular, nonresident holdings of local currency debt have more than doubled since 2009 in emerging market economies, and account for sizeable shares of the debt of Hungary, South Africa, and Malaysia (Chart 2). While this is a welcome development for domestic market deepening and overall financial development, it does come with some risks. [Large non-resident holdings of local currency debt strengthen the linkages between global market conditions and domestic markets and increase the responsiveness of nonresident demand for government bonds to domestic conditions, such as inflation. [ Elsewhere, fiscal accounts are also coming under pressure. In low-income countries, for example, fiscal balances are some three percentage points worse than before the crisis. In frontier economies such as Ghana, Honduras, and Zambia, debt has increased without any associated increase in investment. The external environment is also becoming a lot less benign. Many low-income economies expect projected declines in commodity prices and donor aid flows to have a significant impact on the budget. **Charting a course for fiscal policy** * Advanced economies should elaborate credible and growth-friendly medium-term plans to put debt on a firm downward trajectory. In the event that downside risks to the recovery materialize, and to the extent financing allows, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to kick in. And if growth were to remain low for a prolonged period, measures to boost potential growth should be on the table. * Emerging markets and low-income countries should rebuild fiscal buffers in order to insure against market turbulence or adverse external shocks, particularly for those countries that are currently most exposed to shifts in investor sentiment. Policies to reduce government debt and deficits need to take into account longer-term pressures on public finances. Economic considerations suggest that spending pressures, already on the rise in many countries, will continue to build up over the coming decades. Indeed, as countries become richer, both the demand for public goods and services and the cost of providing them increases relative to other goods and services produced in the economy. Population aging is projected to add to these increases by driving up the costs of health care and pensions. In this respect, the shift in the composition of fiscal adjustment in advanced economies towards expenditure measures is both timely and relevant. In emerging market and developing economies, too, spending pressures will need to be addressed through expenditure reform sooner or later.

[Global financial stability is improving'we have begun to turn the corner. But it is too early to declare victory as there is a need to move beyond liquidity dependence'the central theme of our report'to overcome the remaining challenges to global stability. **Progress** We have made substantial strides over the past few years, and this is now paying dividends. As Olivier Blanchard discussed at yesterday's press conference of the [_World Economic Outlook_, the U.S. economy is gaining strength, setting the stage for the normalization of monetary policy. In **Europe**, better policies have led to substantial improvements in market confidence in both sovereigns and banks. In **Japan**, Abenomics has made a good start as deflationary pressures are abating and confidence for the future is rising. And emerging market economies, having gone through several recent bouts of turmoil, are adjusting policies in the right direction. **Challenges** But financial stability also faces new challenges even as the legacy of the crisis recedes. Let me outline the key challenges. Can the **United States make a smooth exit from unconventional policies?** I call this the 'Goldilocks exit'\u009d ' not too hot, not too cold, just right. This is our baseline, and most likely outcome. After a turbulent start, the normalization of monetary policy has begun. Improved communications is smoothing market adjustment, while 'green shoots'\u009d of economic recovery are increasingly visible 'easy money is leading to credit and the latter is spurring growth. The Fed is now taking its foot off the accelerator gradually through a smooth tapering path. Our baseline is for the Fed to begin lightly touching the brakes with policy rates starting to rise by mid-2015, all the while keeping the car driving smoothly down the road to growth and recovery. **But a bumpy exit'though not our baseline'is possible**. This adverse scenario could be produced by growing concerns in the United States about financial stability risks, or higher-than-expected inflation. The result would likely be a faster rise in policy rates and term premiums, widening credit spreads, and a rise in financial volatility that could spill over to global markets. Though not a new story, **we continue to track growing hotspots in the U.S. financial system**. **Many of these are in the shadow banking system**, such as strong issuance of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, weakened underwriting standards, and underpricing of risk. For instance, high-yield issuance over the past three years is now more than double the amount recorded before the last downturn while high yield bond spreads have fallen close to pre-crisis levels. Supervisory measures, while now more intense, have not yet sufficiently restrained some of these excesses. So a sudden rise in yields could lead to a substantial widening of credit spreads and add to concerns about leverage and future defaults. **Emerging markets** are especially vulnerable to a tightening in the external financial environment, after a prolonged period of capital inflows, easy access to international markets, and low interest rates. This has induced substantial amounts of borrowing, particularly by emerging market companies. But rising interest rates, weakening earnings, and depreciating exchange rates could put substantial pressure on emerging market corporate balance sheets under our adverse scenario. **Indeed, in this scenario, emerging market corporates owing almost 35 percent of outstanding debt could find it hard to service their obligations**. While the situation varies widely across countries, those economies under recent pressure owing to macroeconomic imbalances also share some vulnerabilities in their corporate sectors. In **China**, achieving an orderly deleveraging of the shadow banking system is a key challenge. Nonbank financial institutions have become an important source of financing in China, doubling since 2010 to 30 to 40 percent of GDP. This non-bank lending, though a sign of the system becoming more diversified, is also prone to risks as savers may not realize the higher risks that lie behind the more attractive rates of return offered by nonbank savings products due to the perception of implicit guarantees. The challenge for policymakers is to manage the transition to a financial sector in which market discipline plays a larger role and prices more accurately reflect risks'including through the removal of implicit guarantees'without triggering systemic stress. In the **euro area**, the incomplete repair of bank and corporate balance- sheets continues to place a drag on the recovery. Fragmentation between periphery and core countries persists, as accommodative monetary conditions have not translated into the flow of credit needed to support a stronger recovery, particularly for smaller companies. Thus, further efforts must be made to strengthen bank balance sheets, through the European comprehensive bank assessment and follow-up, and to tackle the corporate debt overhang. While so far spillovers surrounding developments in **Ukraine** have been limited, geopolitical risks remain elevated and could pose a shock to global markets. Finally**, failure to adequately address any of the challenges that I mentioned could have a significant impact on global stability**. The sizeable inflows into emerging markets over the past number of years could reverse. Assets price moves may be amplified by the lower market liquidity conditions, with more investors running for the exit than the exit door can accommodate. This rush for the exit could extend to some segments of developed markets straining market liquidity and amplifying market volatility. **Policy recommendations** The key message is that strong policy actions are needed to definitely turn the corner from the Great Financial Crisis and engineer a successful shift from 'liquidity-driven'\u009d to 'growth-driven'\u009d markets. o **First,** is to get the normalization of US monetary policy right'its timing, execution, and communication. Effective macro-prudential policy is key to allow for smooth exit by containing financial stability risks, particularly in the shadow banking system. o **Second**, emerging markets need to continue to prepare for tightening in global financial conditions by enhancing resilience through strong macro and prudential policies, building policy buffers, and managing corporate financial risks. They should also stand ready to ensure orderly market conditions through adequate provisioning of liquidity in the event of turbulence. o **Third**, while Japan needs to complete Abenomics, the euro area needs to finish cleaning both bank and corporate balance sheets, start the banking union right, and develop non-bank sources of credit to smaller companies. This is paramount for confidence and recovery. But, beyond national actions, we need greater global policy cooperation as we are all in this together. This extends to monetary policy, financial regulation and supervision, and ensuring orderly market conditions.

The dynamics that were emerging at the time of the [October 2013 _World Economic Outlook_ are becoming more visible. Put simply, the recovery is strengthening. In our recent [_World Economic Outlook_, we forecast world growth to be 3.6 percent this year and 3.9 percent next year, up from 3.0 percent last year. **In advanced economies**, we forecast growth to reach 2.2 percent in 2014, up from 1.3 percent in 2013. The recovery which was starting to take hold in October is becoming not only stronger, but also broader. The various brakes that hampered growth are being slowly loosened. Fiscal consolidation is slowing, and investors are less worried about debt sustainability. Banks are gradually becoming stronger. Although we are far short of a full recovery, the normalization of monetary policy'both conventional and unconventional'is now on the agenda. Brakes are loosened at different paces however, and the recovery remains uneven. It is strongest in the United States, where growth is forecast to be 2.8 percent in 2014. It is also strong in the United Kingdom and Germany, where some imbalances persist, but where we forecast growth to be 2.9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. In Japan, where we forecast 1.4 percent growth in 2014, fiscal stimulus has played a large role, and the strength of the recovery depends on private demand taking the relay. And, going back to the Euro area, the good news is that, for the first time in two years, Southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly still low, growth. But, while their exports are generally strong, internal demand is still weak, and it has to become stronger for the recovery to be sustained. **Emerging and developing economies** continue to have strong growth, lower than before the crisis, but high nevertheless. We forecast their growth to reach 4.9 percent this year, slightly up from 4.7 percent last year. In particular, we forecast growth of 7.5 percent for China, and 5.4 percent for India. Of particular note is the performance of sub Saharan Africa, where we forecast growth of 5.4 percent. These emerging and developing economies have to operate however in a changing world environment. Stronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports. The normalization of monetary policy in the United States, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Foreign investors are less forgiving, macroeconomic weaknesses are more costly. And financial bumps, such as those we saw last summer and earlier this year, may well happen again. **Acute risks have decreased, but risks have not disappeared**. Japan will need all three arrows if it is to both sustain growth and maintain fiscal sustainability. Adjustment and recovery in southern Euro countries cannot be taken for granted, especially if Euro area wide inflation remains very low or even, worse, turns to deflation, making the task of reestablishing competitiveness in the South even harder. As discussed in the _Global Financial Stability Report,_ financial reform is incomplete, and the financial system remains at risk. Geopolitical risks have arisen, although they have not yet had global macroeconomic repercussions. **Looking ahead, the focus must increasingly turn to the supply side, and I want to make three points:** **First**, potential growth in many advanced economies is very low. This is bad on its own, but it also makes fiscal adjustment more difficult. In this context, measures to increase potential growth are becoming more important'from rethinking the shape of some labor market institutions, to increasing competition and productivity in a number of non-tradable sectors, to rethinking the size of the government, to reexamining the role of public investment. **Second**, although the evidence is not yet clear, potential growth in many emerging market economies also appears to have decreased. In some countries, such as China, lower growth may be in part a desirable byproduct of more balanced growth. In others, there is clearly scope for some structural reforms to improve the outcome. **Finally**, as the effects of the financial crisis slowly diminish, another trend may come to dominate the scene, namely rising inequality. Though inequality has always been perceived to be a central issue, until recently it was not seen as having major implications for macroeconomic developments. This belief is increasingly called into question. How inequality affects both the macroeconomy, and the design of macroeconomic policy, will likely be increasingly important items on our agenda for a long time to come.

Simply keep inflation low and stable, target a short-term interest rate, and regulate and supervise financial institutions, the mantra went, and all will be well. Of course many scholars and policymakers, especially in emerging markets, were skeptical of this simple creed. But they did not make much headway against a doctrine seemingly well-buttressed by sophisticated theoretical models, voluminous empirical research, and over 20 years of 'Great Moderation'\u009d 'low inflation and output volatility. All of that has changed since the crisis, and ideas that were once marginal have now moved to center stage. We don't yet know where this debate will eventually lead. In some respects, the monetary policy of tomorrow may well look familiar, but in other respects, it is likely to be very different. [Our new paper, co- authored with other IMF staff, takes stock of where the debate stands, and provides a launching pad for further research and reflection. While not the first effort of its kind, this latest work shows just how much momentum the rethinking has gained, with a vast volume of new work by academics and central banks in just the last two or three years. We've invited policymakers, academics, and media from around the world to a high- level conference on April 13 during the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and IMF to give this broad group of stakeholders a further opportunity for discussion. While our paper covers a broader set of issues, here we want to focus on three critical questions on the role of monetary policy and its relationship to financial stability and the economy: Should monetary policy target more than just price stability? Should current policy decision rules be reconsidered? And, finally, what are the challenges for central bank independence under a potentially expanded mandate? **Objectives ** Long-term price stability has been a primary objective of monetary policy for many years, and our review found no good reason why this should change. Low and stable inflation makes it easier for households and businesses to plan, and allows the economy to operate efficiently. But the crisis has shown that this is not enough: dangerous financial imbalances can brew under the apparently tranquil surface of low and stable inflation. And traditional prudential policy, which focused primarily on the stability of individual banks, proved inadequate to deal with the type of system-wide risks that led to the crisis. So macroeconomic policy needs to pay greater attention to financial stability. However, the interest rate will often be a blunt and costly instrument to deal with financial imbalances. Would you put two million people out of work because banks are too leveraged or house prices are rising too fast? Instead, the first line of defense should be instruments that can target financial stability more directly and efficiently, including macroprudential tools, such as loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, and capital flow management measures. Yet, when these tools prove insufficient, we may have to accept a new tradeoff for monetary policy, and the interest rate may have to lend a hand to maintain financial stability. **Policy decision rules** During the crisis, there were tectonic shifts in the structure and regulation of the financial sector. These have affected the impact of monetary policy on the broader economy. Moreover, the short-run relationship between inflation and unemployment seems to have changed. The bottom line is that the details of how the central bank can best achieve its objectives are probably not the same as before the crisis. We still have a lot to learn about how things have changed and by how much, but it is already clear that for some time to come, monetary policy will involve more art and less science. This in itself will pose new challenges, including from a political economy standpoint. A less mechanical and predictable monetary policy may be more exposed to political interference, as we explain below. **Central bank independence** Central bank independence has been helpful to maintain price stability. Ulysses had himself tied to the mast to resist the sirens, and governments tie their monetary policy to an independent central bank to resist the short-term temptation to inflate away fiscal constraints. A simple and measurable mandate allows for effective accountability and makes independence politically feasible. But is it possible to extend independence to also cover financial stability? And critically, can central banks retain independence for price stability if they allow greater government oversight over financial stability? The answer to the first question is not clear. Financial stability is far more difficult to measure than inflation, and policy actions would often have clearer winners and losers than interest rate policy. This complicates accountability and could bring political challenges. As for the second question, countries have chosen a wide range of institutional arrangements to deal with the challenge. In some countries, the central bank leads financial stability policies (Singapore, United Kingdom); elsewhere, the ministry of finance is ultimately in charge (United States). So far, there are no final answers on what works best. **Parting thoughts**** ** What can we expect in the future? Only some of the questions raised here will be settled one way or the other in the short term. Many will require years of new experience and observation. In the meantime, policymakers will have to take decisions on new policies and institutional arrangements, often under great uncertainty. The art of central banking is alive and well.

The recent slowdown in emerging market growth is fueling a growing mania across markets and policy circles. Some worry that a large part of their stellar pace of growth over the 2000s (Figure 1) was due to a favorable external environment'cheap credit and high commodity prices. And, therefore, as advanced economies gather momentum now and begin to normalize their interest rates, and commodity price gains begin to reverse, emerging market growth could slip further. Others instead contend that internal or domestic factors have played a role, with improved standards of governance and genuine structural reforms and robust policies, driving a fundamental transformation in the sources of emerging market growth towards a lower yet more sustainable trajectory. [ The truth lies somewhere in between. What is clear is that emerging markets contribute to a significant share of the global economy, and what matters for them matters increasingly for the global outlook. And what matters for emerging markets over the coming years depends on the extent to which external and internal factors tend to foster or hinder their growth. [Chapter 4 of the April 2014 _World Economic Outlook_ focuses on how external factors have driven growth in emerging market economies in the past 15 years. The analysis suggests that emerging market growth, while still strong, has been slowing in the last two years driven as much by domestic conditions as by external circumstances. **How external factors influence emerging market growth** We find that a strong recovery in advanced economies is on balance good for emerging economies, despite being accompanied by a rise in advanced economy interest rates. Specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in the U.S. growth rate typically raises emerging market growth by 0.3 percentage points in the same quarter, and the cumulative effect stays positive beyond one-to-two years. To understand why, let's consider the various forces at play. First, higher growth in advanced economies should boost exports from emerging markets. Second, global capital would flow back from emerging markets to advanced economies to take advantage of the higher growth and interest rates. For emerging markets that trade more with advanced economies (e.g., Malaysia and Mexico), the first effect would dominate; and for emerging markets that are more open to capital flows (e.g., Chile and Thailand), the second effect could partly or fully offset the first. Our results suggest that for emerging markets as a whole, the impact of the first likely outweighs the second. Not surprisingly, if emerging markets' external financing conditions tighten by more than what can be explained by the recovery in advanced economies, emerging markets tend to suffer, as observed during bouts of market turbulence at the start of 2014. When capital flows out, emerging markets experience a depreciation of their exchange rates that likely helps the competitiveness of their exports. At the same time, they typically raise domestic interest rates to try to stem the capital outflow, an action that hurts growth. Our results suggest that the hit to emerging markets from higher domestic interest rates tends to offset the benefits from the exchange rate depreciation. So we see that how these economies perform depend not only on their exposure to external factors, but also on whether and how they use domestic policies to respond to the changes. So how have internal factors influenced emerging market growth? **External environment versus internal factors** As [previewed in an earlier blog, the deviation of emerging market growth around its average over the last 15 years can be viewed as driven by either external or internal factors. Which one dominates'external or internal factors? We find that external factors explain one-half or more of the growth deviation on average, although with important differences over time and across countries. For instance, the sharp downturn at the peak of the global financial crisis was almost fully accounted for by external factors for most countries. Internal factors dominated in the strong growth uptake in emerging markets in 2006-07. And the pullback in growth since 2012 is also largely attributable to internal factors. These findings resonate well with recent studies that have underscored constraints from domestic structural factors and policy uncertainty as becoming more binding for growth in many larger emerging markets (see blogs by [Anand and Tulin 2014 and [Dabla-Norris and Kocchar 2013). For some large or relatively less open economies, such as China and India, internal factors'more than the external environment'mostly explain the fluctuations in growth from the average level over 1998-2013. [ What about China's role as an external factor for other emerging markets? We would expect the world's second largest economy to also play an important role in determining growth in other emerging markets, and indeed it does. We find that many emerging markets were able to ride on the coat tails of China's strong expansion during the crisis. But China's recent slowdown has also acted to soften their growth (see Figure 3). [ **Shifting gears: adjusting to lower level of emerging market growth** Forecasts of emerging market growth starting in 2007, and conditional on the path of external conditions, reveal that some of the larger emerging markets have grown at lower rates than expected since 2012 (see Figure 4). This suggests that, other, mostly internal, factors are holding growth in many emerging markets, including constraints from domestic structural factors . And if the dampening effects from these internal factors persist as they have over the past year or so, emerging market growth will remain lower for some time, affecting growth in the rest of the world as well. [ **Keeping the house in order** There is no doubt that the external environment will continue to have a strong impact on emerging market growth. And so policymakers must remain vigilant and sensitive to external developments. Many concerns about the ramifications of external shocks are justified. A sharp tightening in external borrowing rates, without a proportionate improvement in advanced economy growth, would hurt emerging markets. China's adjustment to a slower, even if more balanced, pace of growth, will inevitably alter prospects for other emerging markets. And, if advanced economies do not recover as currently expected, emerging markets will feel it too. That said, internal factors are currently suppressing growth below levels expected given even current external conditions. Thus, the recent slowdown in emerging markets appears to be as dependent on internal developments as those from abroad. And the priority for policymakers now is to better understand the role of internal factors and assess whether there is scope for policies to improve these economies' resilience regardless of the external backdrop. The IMF will publish its global forecasts from the _World Economic Outlook _on April 9.

They even rebounded strongly from the Great Recession, notwithstanding the sluggishness in advanced economies. Easy global financial conditions, rising commodity prices and beneficial terms of trade potentially compensated for weak external demand from the advanced economies. But now, emerging market growth, while still strong, has begun to slow. This oddly coincides with an outlook for advanced economies that is improving, even if gradually. So what's behind this dichotomy? Emerging markets are adjusting to changes in the external environment. On the one hand, the incipient recovery in advanced economies is helping emerging markets, including through higher exports. On the other hand, the favourable external financing conditions are now beginning to reverse, implying a tougher financial environment for emerging markets. Then you have domestic factors, which appear to have pulled down growth in some emerging markets (see also IMF blog post on [January 22, 2014, and [December 18, 2013). So how much have external conditions'such as growth in advanced economies and external financial costs, among others, affected emerging markets? And to what extent have domestic conditions influenced emerging market growth? This is a key focus of our forthcoming Chapter 4 in the April 2014 World Economic Outlook. We show that, on average, external conditions tend to explain at least half of the growth variation in emerging markets. That said, there are considerable differences in the contribution of external factors across time (see figure) and across countries. The chapter also delves into the implications of China's transition to a slower, even if more sustainable, pace of growth, and its impact on other emerging markets. Overall, emerging markets will benefit from some external developments, but suffer from others. But if on top of this, the dampening effects from internal factors persist, growth in emerging markets could indeed adjust to a lower level than before, at least temporarily.

The rate decline has been global'average global 10 year real rate declined from 6 percent in 1983 to almost zero in 2012 (see figure). Because the recent interest rate declines reflect, to a large extent, weak economic conditions in advanced economies after the global financial crisis, some reversals are likely as these economy return to a more normal state. **But how much of a reversal?** And what should we expect looking forward to the next five or ten years? High and rising debt levels in advanced economies; population aging; monetary policy tapering; financial deepening in emerging market economies, which would reduce borrowing constraints and thereby net saving'these are all factors that would suggest a substantial increase in interest rates in the medium term.

So Mongolia grew around 6 times faster than the United States, yet of course the United States contributed more to GDP growth'over 150 times more. Why, because size matters. Let's apply this logic to China. A bigger but somewhat slower growing China of the future will contribute about as much to global demand as the smaller but faster growing China of before. This is arithmetic: An economy that is twice as big can grow by \u00c2? as much and contribute the same to global demand. By the way, China today is more than twice as big as it was a decade ago. So, the good news is, even with slower growth, China will continue to be an engine of global output. Indeed, an even bigger engine than before. **How big is China?** Big. China is the world's second largest economy. Based on PPP exchange rates, China increased from 6 percent of global output in 1995, to 15 percent last year (see chart). Or, if you prefer using market exchange rates, the corresponding rise in China's share of global GDP is from 2 percent in 1995 to 12 percent in 2013. [ When will China surpass the US? In 2018, based on PPP exchange rates. Later using market exchange rates'by 2019, the last year of our projections, China's economy would be equivalent to about 64 percent of US GDP. **China is big but not rich** China is the world's most populous country. So per person, GDP in China is US$ 6,500, compared to US$53,100 in the US (see chart). Even the most developed cities in China do not approach the income levels of advanced economies. This underscores that China still has considerable room to grow. Indeed, as the IMF's Managing Director noted in her recent [address at the China Development Forum, China has its eyes fixed firmly on its next destination'aiming for \"higher quality, more inclusive, and more sustainable\" growth. [ **Size matters'\u00a6contribution to global demand** The chart shows how much China is contributing to global growth. In 2003-7, China averaged 11.7 percent growth whereas in the coming five years (2015-19) we expect growth to average 'only' 6.8 percent. Yet, because China's economy is much bigger, the average contribution to global growth will actually _increase_ slightly'rising from 1.0 (2003-7) to 1.1 (2015-19) percentage points. Size matters. Thus, we forecast China to contribute more than before to global output, even though growth is slowing. For exporters, this means China's expanding market will continue to be a great source of future customers. [ And, in the end, the world economy benefits the most from sustainable growth in China. As argued [before, the world should welcome the slowdown in China to a more sustainable growth rate. Welcome, because it means much higher income in the future. And, as shown above, it means that China will continue to be an engine of global growth.

The slump in infrastructure and corporate investment has been the single biggest contributor to India's recent growth slowdown. India's investment growth, averaging above 12 percent during the last decade fell to less than one percent in the last two years. What is especially worrisome is that more and more investment projects are getting delayed and shelved, while the pipeline of new projects has become exceptionally thin. This slowdown has sparked an intense public debate about its causes. Some commentators, including representatives of the business community, argue that high interest rates, which raise financing costs, are the major culprit, dampening investment. Others maintain that interest rates are only partly responsible for the current weak levels of investment, suggesting that a host of other factors, particularly on the supply side, are at play. Our[ new Working Paper seeks to shed some light on the reasons behind this investment malaise. Using a novel index of economic policy uncertainty'an innovation in our analysis'we find that heightened uncertainty regarding the future course of broader economic policies and deteriorating business confidence have played a significant role in the recent investment slowdown.** ** **Disentangling the investment slowdown** How much of the investment slowdown can be attributed to higher interest rates? We analyzed the connection between interest rates and the investment slowdown, based on a simple investment model that takes into account demand and business confidence indicators, as well as the financing cost of investments. We find some striking findings. Real interest rates account for only one quarter of the explained investment slowdown. Further, macroeconomic and financial variables (interest rates, external demand, relative prices, global financial market volatility etc) alone cannot fully explain the weakness in investment. So what are the other determinants of the recent investment slowdown? Several causes of weaker investment activity seem to be of supply-side nature. The following key factors stand out as possible contributors to the recent investment slowdown: * _Rising policy uncertainty. _In particular, high profile tax policy decisions announced in the 2012/13 Budget reduced foreign investors' interest in India, while the increasing difficulty of obtaining land use and environmental permits raised regulatory uncertainty for infrastructure and other large-scale projects. * _Delayed project approvals and implementation._ As a reaction to high-profile governance scandals, project approvals, clearances, and implementation slowed sharply. * _Supply bottlenecks_ are particularly pronounced in miningand power, with attendant consequences for the broader economy, especially manufacturing. **Quantifying the ****impact of policy uncertainty ** How do we pin down the impact of economic policy and regulatory uncertainty? We rely on a novel [measure of policy-related economic uncertainty for India developed and constructed by several Stanford University economists. The application of this index provides an important advancement in quantifying policy uncertainty. The overall Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) measure combines two types of underlying information (see chart). The first component quantifies newspaper coverage of economic policy uncertainty, including regulatory, fiscal and monetary policies uncertainties. The second component combines measures of disagreement among major economic forecasters regarding key macroeconomic variables, namely near-term inflation and the federal government budget deficit. After controlling for economic policy uncertainty, our results show that that financing costs do not appear to be a critical factor in explaining the decline in new investments. Heightened uncertainty and deteriorating business confidence have played a key role in the decline in new investments and postponement and cancellation of others. In other words, these results confirm what is perhaps intuitively obvious'clarity in terms of future policy is critical for a pick up in investment and to ensuring that projects underway are completed. Further, the current level of economic policy uncertainty exceeds its post- Lehman highs, suggesting that uncertainty is primarily driven by India's domestic policy challenges, and not by global uncertainty factors such as the withdrawal of unconventional monetary policy in advanced market economies. **Policies to revive investment ** What does this mean for policy? The IMF's 2014 [annual review on India suggests that continued progress on key structural reforms, including power sector reforms, easing labor restrictions, and enhancing health and education outcomes would help improve the business climate and domestic investment. The Indian authorities have taken a number of steps over the last year to address structural issues, including passage of some long-awaited legislative measures. Most importantly, the Government of India has set up a Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) as well as a Project Monitoring Group (PMG), to fast track stalled large-scale investment projects. The fact that the CCI has cleared investment projects worth about 5 percent of GDP since its inception in January 2013 is an encouraging development. As cleared projects are implemented and remaining uncertainties and bottlenecks are removed, investment activity is likely to pick up, paving the way for revitalizing robust and inclusive economic growth in India.

Japan's economic progress over the past year has been impressive, with strong growth, and inflation, investment, and credit growth all heading in the right direction. But that progress is largely the result of last year's sizable fiscal and monetary stimulus'the first two arrows of 'Abenomics'\u009d. Now, the economy needs to transition to more sustainable, private-sector led growth. A hike in wages could be just the push needed to propel that shift. As the ongoing annual wage-bargaining round draws to a close, total earnings are set to increase this year for employees at some well-known car manufacturers. But, in the past, these increases have not trickled down to higher basic wages at small and medium-sized enterprises and to non-regular workers. This is problematic as higher inflation without higher incomes can hardly be characterized as a successful reform. **The argument for higher wages** For many years, nominal basic wages have been declining despite generally tight labor-market conditions. Real wages too have fallen despite solid productivity growth. So, labor's share of national income has dwindled, from around 66 percent at the turn of the millennium to around 60 percent today. The average Japanese worker has been dipping into his savings to finance consumption growth. But there's a limit to how far he can do this. The savings rate as a percent of disposable income has declined from around 5 percent a decade ago to close to zero today, leaving little further room for spending from savings, amid a continued high financing demand from the government that still runs a sizeable deficit. [ Looking forward, real wages are set to come under even greater pressure this year and next with higher underlying inflation and successive increases in the consumption-tax rate. So the message is clear: higher wages are needed to_ _help to break the deflationary spiral and establish a virtuous growth cycle. Insofar wage increases are passed on to consumers by firms, higher nominal wages would allow the Bank of Japan to meet its inflation target more rapidly, without overburdening monetary policy. Insofar real wages increase, larger pay packets would also support aggregate demand and create favorable conditions for firms to raise their investment. To be sure, wages are just one ingredient for a successful transition to self- sustained growth. It also requires shaking off other remnants of the deflationary mindset. Financial institutions need to actively pursue new lending opportunities at home and abroad rather than accumulate excess reserves at the Bank of Japan. Exporters need to take advantage of the weaker yen by trying to gain a larger market share. And firms will need to put their retained earnings and increased valuations to good use, by raising investment, and increasing dividend payments, aside from offering higher wages. **Factors that prevent wages from rising** Compared to other countries, Japan stands out in having downward nominal wage flexibility and upward rigidity. It is indeed surprising that with the Bank of Japan's 2-percent inflation target gaining credibility and underlying inflation picking up markedly, wages still appear to remain rather sluggish. The blame lies with structural factors which have long depressed wage growth in Japan as well as the challenge to overcome a coordination problem now that economic conditions are changing: * **The emergence of non-regular workers** amid generally low horizontal mobility of employees. Although this has contributed to greater labor market flexibility, firms and non-regular workers have fewer incentives to invest in firm-specific human capital, hampering productivity growth. Since these workers' wages are lower, their growing share has pushed down aggregate basic wage growth. * **Competitiveness concerns** from persistent exchange rate appreciation prior to Abenomics in the context of increased foreign competition and technology catch-up. The result has been limited domestic wage increases and more overseas production and outsourcing. * **A weak SME sector**'which accounts for close to 70 percent of employment'that even under last year's buoyant conditions may not have benefitted from Abenomics due to higher energy, as well as other intermediate imported goods costs as a result of the weaker yen. * **A coordination problem. **Given Japan's history of low growth and deflation, lack of formal or de-facto wage indexation, and segmented labor markets, if left to the market, firms will want to free-ride on wage increases by other firms. This coordination problem has been amplified by the declining importance of the annual wage-bargaining round in April ('Shunto'\u009d), with firm-level profitability now playing a dominant role and bonuses and overtime payments comprising important shares of compensation, especially for larger firms. [ **Measures to raise wages** The structural factors will have to be addressed through Abenomics' Third Arrow: ambitious growth reforms to create a more vibrant and competitive corporate sector with greater and more equal labor force participation. For example, measures to reduce duality in the labor market and a gradual shift towards a model that combines labor market flexibility and security ('flexicurity'\u009d) could provide a boost to aggregate compensation growth. But are there ways to enhance coordination in the near term? Prime Minister Abe has been relying on 'moral suasion', by explicitly asking profit-making companies to increase wages. As a natural extension of this strategy, the Abe administration also moved toward a wider policy of 'social concertation', by setting up the Tripartite Commission, in which the government becomes more directly involved in discussions with employers and trade unions. The government recently decided not to extend the 7.8 percent cut in wages of national public servants'which was introduced in 2012 to finance reconstruction spending and is now set to expire on April 1, 2014'which is also likely to push up salaries of local government workers. Complementing these measures, tax incentives for raising wages have also been introduced. Specifically, a tax credit has been introduced equal to 10% of incremental labor expenses provided the firm's wage bill rises by 2%'gradually rising to 5% by 2017. To enhance effectiveness, these could be made permanent, or targeted more to increases in base wages only, while the tax credit could be raised, although this will likely give rise to well-known deadweight losses (firms receive incentives for wage increases they might have provided anyway). Finally, Japan's minimum wage is among the lowest in OECD countries. Tentative evidence (using prefectural data) suggests a positive relation between minimum and basic wages. Higher than usual increases in the minimum wage might therefore help to spur wage growth, although these may cause job losses among non-regular workers and in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.

Growing links with China have supported economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. But the burgeoning commercial and financial ties between the developing subcontinent and the world's second-biggest economy carry risks as well. These links also expose sub-Saharan African countries to potentially negative spillovers from China if the Asian giant's growth slows or the composition of its demand changes. The old aphorism 'If America sneezes, the world catches a cold'\u009d referred to the U.S. economy's role as a locomotive for the global economy, but it can now apply to any symbiotic relationship between a dominant economy and its clients. China has become a major development partner of sub-Saharan Africa. It is now the subcontinent's largest single trading partner and a key investor and provider of aid. China's increasing role in sub-Saharan Africa reflects China's increasing share as a major player in world trade and its historic reorientation, started during the last decade and more, toward new markets including Africa. The natural-resource intensity in China's economic growth and sub-Saharan Africa's natural resource abundance have further strengthened the relationship. **Spillover starts here** We have assembled data that measure how changes in Chinese investment affected exports from Africa over the last decade and a half. These data show that sub- Saharan Africa's resource-rich economies, in particular, are subject to spillover from China: natural resource exports from Africa quickly reflect trends in Asia's dominant economy. Overall, sub-Saharan Africa has maintained a slight trade deficit with China, with fewer than half of the African countries having a trade surplus with China. In addition, China's trade with sub-Saharan Africa is highly concentrated in a few economies. Five countries'Angola, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Equatorial Guinea'account for about 75 percent of the subcontinent's exports to China. Also, Africa's exports to China are heavily concentrated in primary products, mainly oil. By 2008 (before the short-lived collapse in oil prices in 2009), mineral fuel and related materials accounted for about 45 percent of all sub- Saharan African exports to China, and for more than 84 percent of exports if we exclude South African exports. **Varied intensity** We use panel data to analyze the way in which China's domestic investment has affected sub-Saharan Africa's export growth during the past 15 years. We find that a 1 percentage point change in China's real domestic fixed asset investment growth would alter sub-Saharan Africa's export growth rate on average by 0.6 percentage point, but the intensity varies by country group. [ Look at the chart. On top of average export growth for each country between 1995 and 2011 (the red bars) we have added the additional export growth (the blue bars) triggered by a defined boost in Chinese investment. And we have split the countries into groups according to their natural resources: on top, those that have few resources; in the middle, those that have resources other than oil; and on the bottom those that export oil. The differences are uniform and plain to see. Changes in Chinese investment do a little for the resource-thin top group, appreciably more for the non-oil resource middle group, and a lot more for the oil exporters. These results directly correlate with the primary product'intensity of China's trade with Africa. **China effect** The China effect is larger for resource-rich countries in sub-Saharan Africa, especially oil exporters, because they account for a large share of the region's exports to China. Part of the effect is indirect, working through the impact of Chinese investment on global growth and commodity prices. But direct trading links are also important. For the top five resource-rich sub-Saharan African countries ranked by exports to China as a share of GDP'Angola, South Africa, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo'a 1 percentage point change in China's domestic investment growth would be accompanied by a 0.8 percentage point change in their export growth rate. Thus the chart also shows which African countries will have the biggest spillover effects from any change in China's economic performance'and where in Africa the need for a stiff course of antibiotics will be greatest if Asia's biggest economy catches a chill.

These are difficult times for ministers of finance. Fiscal constraints are tight and raising economic growth a priority. At the same time, income inequality is on the rise, and so is public pressure for governments to do something about it through their tax and spending policies. What's a minister to do? How can he or she meet these seemingly incompatible demands? A new IMF [paper provides some guidance. Governments, of course, will have their own equity objectives. What the paper aims to do is look at precisely how countries can achieve their distributional goals'whatever they are'at the least possible cost to (and maybe even increasing) economic efficiency. This can help achieve sustainable growth and, in many cases, lead to fiscal savings. An earlier [study by IMF researchers found that on average, fiscal redistribution has been associated with higher growth, because it helps reduce inequality. A key message from the latest paper is that design matters. At the same time, there has been a diversity of experience: if poorly designed, or pushed too far, redistributive policies have proven to be distortive. But experience also shows that some redistributive fiscal policies can in fact help improve efficiency and support growth, such as those that enhance the human capital of low-income households. This suggests that the devil is in the details.** ** **Impact of taxes and spending on redistribution** Fiscal policy plays a significant role in reducing income inequality in advanced economies, mostly through transfers'such as pensions and other social benefits. Income taxes also play a role. For instance, transfers and income taxes have been found to decrease inequality'as measured by the Gini coefficient'in advanced economies by an average of around one-third (Figure). [ In developing economies, low levels of taxes and spending limit the extent of fiscal redistribution, as does the incomplete access of the poor to public education and health. [ [ Reflecting lower revenues, developing economies also have much lower social spending, with a relatively smaller share allocated to social benefits (social insurance and social assistance). The redistributive impact of social benefits is diminished further by incomplete coverage of lower-income groups and the large share of transfers leaking to higher-income groups. Unlike in advanced economies, the distribution of in-kind spending (education and health) reinforces, rather than reduces inequality, reflecting the fact that the poor'who often live in rural areas'often have less access to public schools or health facilities.** ** **Smart design'at the top and at the bottom of the income ladder** To be efficient and avoid distortions, redistribution requires careful design of taxes and spending, with a special focus on those at both the top and the bottom of the income distribution. All income groups should pay their fair share of taxes, including those at the top. But tax rates should not be so high that this leads to a big reduction in work effort and investment, since this could depress economic growth, to the detriment of all. Taxes should also be designed so they are not easy to evade. To help those at the bottom in an efficient manner, priority should be given to spending programs that improve their health and education. Because these programs increase labor productivity, they can both improve equality and raise economic growth. Another important guideline for spending programs is to target them to lower-income groups, rather than provide them to rich and poor alike. It is important to not withdraw these benefits as income rises so rapidly as to significantly discourage work effort. But, done well, this targeting can help countries achieve their distributive goals at a lower fiscal cost. What exactly does this imply for a minister looking to enhance equality? First, it means looking at the tax and spending side together, rather than each separately. On the tax side, advanced and developing countries can consider the following possibilities: * **A greater role for recurrent property taxes**. Property taxes are underutilized in many countries, particularly in developing economies where they have significant potential. * **More progressive personal income taxes**. There is room for a number of countries to move away from flat tax rates to more progressive rate structures. The progressivity of these taxes is also often impaired by deductions that disproportionally benefit those with higher incomes.** ** * **A revival of inheritance and gift taxes**. While these have never been, and probably will not be, big revenue raisers, a modest revival in such a way that it prevents ample evasion and avoidance'the mistake of many systems in the past' could have a marked effect. On the spending side, the minister may consider: * **Expanding the access of low-income families to education and health**. One way to do this for education is by expanding scholarships for low-income families. In developing countries, access to health care should focus on providing essential services; advanced economies should focus on maintaining access for the poor, even during periods of spending restraint. * **Targeting social benefits and strengthening incentives to work**. Untargeted benefits, such as energy subsidies, should be replaced with more targeted programs (strategies for doing so are discussed in a recent IMF [book). In advanced economies, linking social benefits to labor force participation (including through childcare subsidies and child tax credits) can strengthen incentives to enter the labor market and decrease welfare dependency. * **Safeguarding pensions and raising retirement ages**. In the advanced economies, this means ensuring that benefit levels for poor pensioners are not reduced. In developing economies where only a small share of the elderly poor receives pensions, the focus should be on expanding coverage through noncontributory, means-tested social pensions. A new IMF [book looks into these issues in detail. **Concluding thoughts** Efficient policy design requires an eye for detail. But governments should not lose sight of the bigger picture. The impact of tax and spending should, for instance, be considered jointly and not separately for each single instrument; and redistribution must always be consistent with other macroeconomic objectives. Design should also properly account for constraints in administrative capacity. But these are not insurmountable hurdles'the good news is that quite a lot is now known about how governments can best set about squaring their equity and efficiency concerns.

Indeed, there are many clear lessons on the causes of past crises, the severity of their consequences, and how future crises can be prevented or better managed when they occur. This applies to the 2007-09 global financial crisis that brought colossal disruptions in asset and credit markets, massive erosions of wealth, and unprecedented numbers of bankruptcies. Six years after the crisis began, its lingering effects are still visible in advanced and emerging markets alike. It is, therefore, a good time to take stock. A new book, [_'Financial Crises: Causes, Consequences, and Policy Responses_'\u009d (which I co-edited with M. Ayhan Kose, Luc Laeven, and Fabian Valencia), does exactly that: it provides a comprehensive overview of research on financial crises and surveys policy lessons in the context of a wide range of crises, including banking, balance of payments, and sovereign debt crises. We present four key insights. * **_It is hard, but possible, to reduce the incidence of financial crises. _**Crises can have domestic or external origins and can stem from problems in the balance sheets of private or public sectors. Analyses collected in the book shows that proximate causes of crises include weak supervision and regulation, poorly timed and designed forms of financial liberalization, underpriced deposit insurance, and poorly designed safety nets. Addressing these issues, which is currently being done in many countries through new regulations, improved supervision and other institutional reforms, is therefore of key importance. * **_It is hard, but not impossible, to predict crises._** Because crises are driven by a variety of factors, it remains a puzzle why they occur in the first place, and predicting where and when they may strike is tricky. However, irrespective of their specific origins, financial crises are often preceded by booms in credit and asset markets, notably housing markets. Given these associations, many have recognized the need to be wary about such booms. Designing and using macroprudential policies to help mitigate these booms has therefore become a welcome priority for policymakers. **__** * **_Financial crises often exact large economic costs._** A crisis is commonly an amalgam of sharp drops in credit and asset prices, a severe reduction in the supply of external financing, and large-scale balance sheet problems. Analyses in the book show that these disruptions in financial markets often have severe macroeconomic consequences. Notably, recessions with large output losses are common across the various types of crises. The real effects of crises are also quite persistent. While growth eventually returns to its pre-crisis rate, output tends to stay depressed for an extended period of time, especially following banking crises, with no catch-up, on average, to the pre-crisis trend in the medium term. * **_Policies can make a big difference. _**The timing, mix, and depth of policy measures can greatly determine the real costs of crises. On the one hand, expansionary macroeconomic policies can help avoid an even sharper contraction in activity and can allow banks to recover more quickly and renew lending. On the other hand, such policies may discourage more active restructuring ' of financial institutions, corporations, and households ' and structural reforms, with the risk of prolonging the crisis and depressing growth further into the future. The use of guarantees on bank liabilities can contain liquidity pressures on banks upfront, but come with substantial fiscal contingencies. In contrast, direct capital injections impact the public purse upfront, but some resources can be recovered when public shareholdings are returned to private hands. Striking the right balance, or not, among these various policies, restructurings, and reforms can determine the overall fiscal and economic costs of a crisis. **Prevention is better than a cure** The book presents a wealth of valuable lessons on how to better monitor and reform economies and financial systems to avoid crises and provides an overview of critical policy areas. But it covers more than these insights ' it also introduces a comprehensive database covering various types of crises and has lessons from sovereign debt restructuring episodes. And, given that much remains to be explored, the book also provides a guide for future research.

The more you know your investors, the better you understand the potential risks and how to deal with them. **Some of the facts** We compiled comparable and standardized estimates of the investor base of emerging markets' government debt using the same approach [we designed last year to track who owns advanced economy government debt. We use [data from 24 emerging market countries and we've made it available for anyone interested in further research (Figure 1). The data covers the period from 2004 through June 2013. By our estimates, half a trillion dollars in foreign investment poured into emerging market government bonds from 2010 until 2012 alone, most of it from foreign financial institutions that aren't banks (large institutional investors, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds). These investors held about $800 billion of the debt'80 percent of the total'at end-2012. **We also calculate that foreign central banks held about $40 to $80 billion of the debt, and their holdings appear to be concentrated in seven countries: Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, Malaysia, Mexico and South Africa.** Why this money poured in to emerging market economies over the last decade is partly related to improvements in public debt management. In particular, emerging markets have extended the maturity of their debt profile, cut down issuance of floating rate debt, and reduced foreign currency debt. This made their public balance sheet more resilient to exchange rate and interest rate shocks, and reduced risks on the supply-side of government debt. Partly as a result, foreign interest in emerging market government debt rose sharply in recent years. **Rising foreign participation in emerging market government debt markets creates opportunities and new risks, notably on the demand side. ** Rising foreign participation in government debt markets can help reduce borrowing costs and spread risks more broadly among investors, but it can also raise external funding risks for countries. Moreover, having a view of investors across countries is essential for understanding the dynamics of global demand for government debt. Changes in global investor's allocations among countries are important because they can affect many countries all at once. **Before, during and after the global financial crisis**** ** We found that foreign investors distinguished among emerging market economies in three distinct periods'before, during and after the global financial crisis. Before the crisis, they showed moderate differentiation among countries: some received inflows while others faced outflows. As it usually happens, this differentiation became much sharper during the crisis. However, during the third period (2010'12), we found that foreign flows became almost always positive and much less differentiated (Figure 2). Part of these inflows can be explained by improving economic fundamentals in a number of emerging markets in this period. Five emerging markets reached or regained investment grade status during 2010'12: Colombia, Indonesia, Latvia, Romania, and Uruguay. Most emerging markets weathered the crisis well, with a relatively quick return to high growth. This may have raised expectations of currency appreciation in emerging markets, attracting further demand from foreign investors. At the same time, even countries whose credit ratings deteriorated or did not improve during this period continued to receive inflows against the background of near-zero interest rates in advanced economies. **Emerging markets can prepare** Last year we developed a framework to examine how potential sudden stops in foreign money may impact government debt markets. **In our new analysis, we've run illustrative scenarios to see what might happen under different circumstances.** We designed these to assess the impact of a shock, not to predict the _likelihood _of one.**~~ ~~** The scenarios show that, for a given level of foreign participation in government bond markets, countries with the following characteristics would be less sensitive to external funding risks: * **lower debt-to-GDP ratio** * **lower gross financing needs** * **more developed domestic financial systems** * **larger liquidity buffers to protect against external shocks.** So the scenarios illustrate the importance of extending the maturity of government debt, developing a local investor base, and maintaining liquidity buffers to mitigate the potential harm from a sudden outflow of foreign funding. Countries that had these mitigating measures, such as Mexico and Poland, faced less pressure on bonds yields during the summer of 2013, despite having higher foreign ownership of government debt.** ** For all these reasons, emerging markets need to carefully track who owns their debt and for how long. They need to beef up their communications with their investor base to understand their needs. Understanding the benefits and risks of foreign ownership in emerging market debt is key. Is there some perfect mix of domestic and foreign investors? Stay tuned for the upcoming analysis in the next issue of the _Global Financial Stability Report_ for more on that.

On one side are those who worry about the associated prospect of prolonged recession. On the other are those who see the risk as overblown. This blog and [the video below sift through both sides of the debate to argue the following: * Although inflation'headline and core'has fallen and stayed well below the ECB's 2% price stability mandate, so far there is no sign of classic deflation, i.e., of widespread, self-feeding, price declines. * But even ultra low inflation'let us call it 'lowflation'\u009d'can be problematic for the euro area as a whole and for financially stressed countries, where it implies higher real debt stocks and real interest rates, less relative price adjustment, and greater unemployment. * Along with Japan's experience, which saw deflation worm itself into the system, this argues for a more pre-emptive approach by the ECB. ## ## I. Is there deflation? Mario Draghi has described deflation in the euro area as a situation where price level declines occur (1) across a significant number of countries; (2) across a significant number of goods; and (3) in a self-fulfilling way. By this definition, the term \"deflation\" is arguably overstatement. First, on geographical scope, recent price changes have been positive in all but 3 countries (versus 12 countries as recently as 2009). [ Second, regarding incidence across goods and services, outright price declines account for only a fifth of the HICP basket ' not a high share and, again, no more than in 2009, when the event passed without deflationary consequence. [ Third, is there is a \"self-fulfilling\" dynamic in the sense that _expected future_ inflation is dragging down _current_ inflation? Here the answer is less obvious. If by expected future inflation we mean longer term rates, then the answer is no: expected inflation 5-10 years out is flat and so could not possibly be the _cause_ of falling current inflation. But if we consider 2-4 year ahead expected inflation, the horizon relevant for many spending decisions and wage negotiations, these are falling and could be affecting current inflation. That said, actual inflation stabilized in February at 0.8%. [ ## II. But if it's not 'deflation'\u009d, what's the problem? In the current European context, even very low inflation can scupper the nascent recovery and pressure the most fragile countries. ### Problem #1 Both deflation and less-than-previously-expected inflation increase the real burden of existing debt and the real interest rate that borrowers pay. As it happens, the countries with deflation/low inflation, marked red in the chart below, also happen to be the ones with already higher debt burdens (private + public) and real rates, and include all the countries that have been under market pressure during the crisis. [ ### Problem #2 While deflation/lower inflation in high debt countries is painful to them, at least it improves relative prices, and hence exports and current account sustainability. Unfortunately, when inflation turns low _everywhere_ in the euro area, each unit of deflation/low inflation endured by indebted countries delivers less price adjustment relative to the surplus countries. Or put another way, each point of relative price adjustment must be bought at the cost of greater debt deflation. ### Problem #3 When demand drops and nominal wages are sticky, the hit to unemployment is cushioned by any on-going inflation, which effectively lowers the _real_ wages that firms pay. That cushion is now badly needed. In Spain, we see in the next chart that, after the crisis, the wage distribution slammed against the zero- barrier, with 30% of the distribution concentrated there. Given sticky nominal wages, near zero inflation in Spain is not helping to resolve the severe unemployment problem there. [ ## III. What are the lessons from Japan's experience? There are at least two. ### Lesson #1 One should not take too much comfort in the fact that _long-term_ inflation expectations are positive (over 2% in the euro area). Long-term inflation expectations on the eve of three deflationary episodes in Japan were _also_ reassuringly positive. But nearer-term expectations turned more pessimistic, feeding into spending and wage decisions and delivering actual deflation. Long-term expectations adjusted too little and too slowly to be a useful guide to monetary policy. The takeaway: _not_-_so_-_long-term_ inflation expectations, which we saw are falling in the euro area, also need to be given due consideration. [ [ ### Lesson #2 One needs to act forcefully _before_ deflation sets in. As shown below, the Bank of Japan was relatively slow in lowering policy rates and ratcheting up base money. In the event, it had to resort to ever-increasing stimulus once deflation set in (shaded grey areas in the second chart). Two decades on, that effort is still ongoing. [ [ ## IV. Conclusion You can have too much of a good thing, including low inflation. Very low inflation may benefit important segments of the population, notably net savers. But in the current context of widespread indebtedness problems, it is working to the detriment of recovery in the euro area, especially in the more fragile countries, where it is thwarting efforts to reduce debt, regain competitiveness and tackle unemployment. The ECB must be sure that policies are equal to the tasks of reversing the downward drift in inflation and forestalling the risk of a slide into deflation. It should thus consider further cuts in the policy rate and, more importantly, look for ways to substantially increase its balance sheet, be it through targeted LTROs or quantitative easing (public and private asset purchases).

At the same time, there are formidable headwinds to overcome. Debt owed by households and businesses remains high, making a rapid pick-up in consumption and investment unlikely. Contracting bank lending, as well as relatively tougher credit conditions in the countries most in need of support, are also holding back recovery.

Ostry and [Andrew Berg ( Rising income inequality looms high on the global policy agenda, reflecting not only fears of its pernicious social and political effects, (including questions about the consistency of extreme inequality with democratic governance), but also the economic implications. While positive incentives are surely needed to reward work and innovation, excessive inequality is likely to undercut growth, for example by undermining access to health and education, causing investment-reducing political and economic instability, and thwarting the social consensus required to adjust in the face of major shocks. Understandably, economists have been trying to understand better the links between rising inequality and the fragility of economic growth. Recent narratives include how inequality intensified the leverage and financial cycle, sowing the seeds of crisis; or how political-economy factors, especially the influence of the rich, allowed financial excess to balloon ahead of the crisis. But what is the role of policy, and in particular fiscal redistribution to bring about greater equality? Conventional wisdom would seem to suggest that redistribution would in itself be bad for growth but, conceivably, by engendering greater equality, might help growth. Looking at past experience, we find scant evidence that typical efforts to redistribute have on average had an adverse effect on growth. And faster and more durable growth seems to have followed the associated reduction in inequality. **Disentangling the effects of inequality and redistribution on growth** In [earlier work, we documented a robust medium-run relationship between equality and the sustainability of growth. We did not, however, have much to say on whether this relationship justifies efforts to redistribute. Indeed, many argue that redistribution undermines growth, and even that efforts to redistribute to address high inequality are the source of the correlation between inequality and low growth. If this is right, then taxes and transfers may be precisely the wrong remedy: a cure that may be worse than the disease itself. The literature on this score remains controversial. A number of papers point out that some policies that are redistributive'e.g., public investments in infrastructure, spending on health and education, and social insurance provision'may be both pro-growth and pro-equality. Others are more supportive of a fundamental tradeoff between redistribution and growth, as argued by Okun (1975) when he referred to the efficiency 'leaks'\u009d that come with efforts to reduce inequality. In a [new paper, we ask what the historical data say about the relationship between inequality, redistribution, and growth. In particular, what is the evidence about the macroeconomic effects of redistributive policies, both directly on growth, and indirectly as they reduce inequality, which in turn affects growth? To disentangle the channels, we make use of a new cross-country data set that carefully distinguishes net (post-tax and transfers) inequality from market (pre-tax and transfers) inequality and allows us to calculate redistributive transfers for a large number of countries over time'covering both advanced and developing countries. We analyze the behavior of average growth during five- year periods as well as the sustainability and duration of growth. Our key questions are empirical. How big is the 'big tradeoff'\u009d? How does the direct (in Okun's view negative) effect of redistribution compare to its indirect and apparently positive effect through reduced inequality? **Some striking results on the links between redistribution, inequality and growth** _First_, we continue to find that inequality is a robust and powerful determinant both of the pace of medium-term growth and of the duration of growth spells, even controlling for the size of redistributive transfers. Thus, it would still be a mistake to focus on growth and let inequality take care of itself, if only because the resulting growth may be low and unsustainable. Inequality and unsustainable growth may be two sides of the same coin. And _second_, there is remarkably little evidence in the historical data used in our paper of adverse effects of fiscal redistribution on growth. The average redistribution, and the associated reduction in inequality, seem to be robustly associated with higher and more durable growth. We find some mixed signs that very large redistributions may have direct negative effects on growth duration, such that the overall effect'including the positive effect on growth through lower inequality'is roughly growth-neutral. **Caveats** These findings may suggest that countries that have carried out redistributive policies have actually designed those policies in a reasonably efficient way. However, it does not mean of course that countries wishing to enhance the redistributive role of fiscal policy should not pay attention to efficiency considerations. This is especially important for countries with weak governance and administrative capacity, where developing tax and spending instruments that can allow governments to undertake redistribution efficiently are of the essence. A forthcoming paper by the IMF will delve into these fiscal issues. We should also be cautious about drawing definitive policy implications from cross-country regression analysis alone, of course. We know from history and first principles that after some point redistribution will be destructive to growth, and that beyond some point extreme equality also cannot be conducive to growth. And causality is difficult to establish with full confidence. And we also know that different sorts of policies are likely to have different effects in different countries at different times. **Bottom line** The conclusion that emerges from the historical macroeconomic data used in this paper is that, on average across countries and over time, the things that governments have typically done to redistribute do not seem to have led to bad growth outcomes. And quite apart from ethical, political, or broader social considerations, the resulting equality seems to have helped support faster and more durable growth. To put it simply, we find little evidence of a 'big tradeoff'\u009d between redistribution and growth. Inaction in the face of high inequality thus seems unlikely to be warranted in many cases.

What is the latest assessment? **A strong start** There is no doubt that Portugal has made remarkable progress over the past three years. When the sovereign lost access to international bond markets in 2011, the outlook was grim. The economy was facing large domestic and external imbalances and dismal growth prospects. Unprecedented official financing from Portugal's European partners and the IMF provided a window of opportunity to address the weaknesses at the root of the crisis and regain market confidence. While constrained by formal and informal strictures, the authorities rose to the occasion. The authorities have made substantial progress in fiscal adjustment, while needing to frontload it in view of the high debt burden and to establish fiscal policy credibility. However, it is important to recognize that fiscal targets were relaxed when it was possible to do so, to avoid more severe consequences on growth. All told, about two-thirds of the structural fiscal effort necessary to comply with the European Fiscal Compact's medium-term objectives has now been completed. Equally important, wide-ranging structural reforms were enacted in spite of difficult socio-economic circumstances and legal hurdles. The government took steps to improve the functioning of the labor and product markets and make the business environment more conducive to growth. External adjustment has exceeded expectations implying a lower need to borrow from overseas; and financial stability has been preserved. The economy now shows early signs that it may have turned the corner. In light of the progress on all of these fronts, foreign bond market investors seem reassured, and sovereign yields recently dipped to their lowest level since April-2010. **Risks persist; unemployment remains high ** These significant achievements in a relatively short period of time, however, do not mean the job is complete. Unemployment remains high, and even more so for the youth and long-term job seekers. Both public and non-financial private sector debt'respectively close to 129 and 255 percent of GDP'remain uncomfortably high by any standard. Faced with such high debt, clearly, further fiscal consolidation and private sector deleveraging will be necessary. But perhaps more importantly, working these heavy burdens down will require sustained high growth. One thing is certain: durable high growth cannot be achieved by going back to the old pre-crisis model. There is no room to borrow more for consumption or unproductive investment. Moreover, since Portugal's negative investment position vis-\u00c3 -vis the rest of the world is so large'currently above 110 percent of GDP'and tilted toward debt, borrowing externally is not an option for the foreseeable future. The economy needs to generate external surpluses to reduce this negative investment position; investment needs to be geared toward tradable sectors'sectors that generate their earnings by selling their goods and services abroad; growth and employment have to be driven by exports. This means that sustaining efforts to raise the economy's competitiveness is the only path forward. **Adjustment burden should not fall excessively on labor** Given the constraints imposed by the monetary union framework, and in the absence of exchange rate flexibility, boosting the economy's competitive position requires lowering unit labor and other input costs, raising productivity, and enhancing firms' ability to adjust to shocks. We have seen some progress in lowering unit labor costs in the private sector, facilitated in part by the reforms implemented thus far to soften employment protection and encouraging more flexible work arrangements, allowing enterprises to better adjust to the demand shock they were facing. Reforms to collective bargaining have helped to better align wages and productivity. While more could be done to improve labor market functioning and employment opportunities, reducing other production costs is perhaps even more important. For one, labor costs make up only about 30 percent of operational costs. In addition, it is important to ensure that the burden of adjustment does not fall excessively on labor and is balanced by adjustment elsewhere. Therefore, ambitious product market reforms aimed at increasing competition and reducing rents in the nontradable sector need to be a centerpiece of the growth agenda going forward. Progress has been made on this front. Nonetheless, a lot more can be done to take the process forward. One priority is to identify remaining impediments to price flexibility and steps to boost productivity. Another one is to ensure that the new laws and regulations translate into effective change and lower input prices for exporters. **Maintain the momentum** Policymakers need to persist with ambitious reforms'to bring ongoing fiscal adjustment to term, to facilitate private sector deleveraging, and to boost competitiveness. Portugal cannot go back to the pre-crisis economic model which proved unsustainable. What has been achieved thus far, and under difficult circumstances, deserves to be recognized and needs to be taken forward over coming years. This will take time, and continued efforts will be needed irrespective of who is in power. It will require as broad a consensus as possible.

Unemployment rates in these economies shot up at the onset of the Great Recession and, five years later, remain very high. Some argue that this is to be expected given that the economy remains well below trend and press for greater easing of macroeconomic policies (e.g. [Krugman, 2011, [Kocherlakota (2014)). Others suggest that the job losses, particularly in countries like Spain and Ireland, have been too large to be explained by developments in output, and may largely reflect structural problems in their labor markets. Even in the United States, where unemployment rates have fallen over the past year, there is [concern that increasing numbers of people are dropping out of the labor force, thus decoupling jobs and growth. [ **Strong link between employment and growth** What does the evidence show? In [new research, Laurence Ball, Daniel Leigh and I find that the link between output growth and employment growth holds strongly in most advanced economies. We find no evidence that this link'which goes by the wonkish name of Okun's Law'broke down during 2008 to 2013, including in high unemployment countries like Ireland and Spain. On average across the 20 advanced economies we study, a 1 percentage point increase in output growth leads to a \u00c2? percentage point increase in employment growth (Figure 1). This link between jobs and growth, called the Okun coefficient, varies across countries, ranging from high values of 1.5 for Spain and 0.7 for Ireland to low values of 0.3 for Italy and 0.2 for Austria. The high value of Spain's Okun coefficient reflects the greater use of temporary contracts there compared to other countries: this means that when times are good many new jobs are created but there is also a lot of job loss during recessions. We find that Okun's Law survived the stress test of the Great Recession: there is little evidence that the link between growth and jobs changed appreciably over the course of the Great Recession. This is evident from Figure 2, where the Okun's coefficients for the full period 1980 to 2013 are essentially the same as what they were before the Great Recession. [ Figure 3 shows tracks the relationship between employment and output growth for two countries in our sample, the United States and Spain. The trajectory of output and employment since 2007 is highlighted in red in the figures. For the United States, Okun's Law fits very well, that is, the relationship between output and employment growth is strong (Figure 3a). During the Great Recession, there was a year in which U.S. employment fell quite a bit more than expected, but the historical relationship was restored by 2013. (It is worth noting that a similar relationship for unemployment would indicate that U.S. unemployment today is about a percentage point lower than its historical relationship with output growth, consistent with the view of [Erceg and Levin that people dropping out of the labor force could be accounting for some of the sharp drop in U.S. unemployment.) [ [ In the case of Spain the jobs-growth link is very tight with little evidence that it broke down over the Great Recession; the trajectory shown in red remains close to the historical relationship (Figure 3b). **Course of policy action** Our evidence matters for the interpretation of employment movements and for policy. The alleged breakdown of the jobs-growth link is often used as support for the view that the problems in the labor market are structural in nature and would not be solved by policy responses aimed at bringing about a cyclical recovery. [McKinsey (2011), for example, argues that Okun's Law has broken down and that a return to full employment will thus require not just 'healthy GDP growth [but also] major efforts in education, regulation, and even diplomacy.'\u009d In contrast, our results suggest that, as [IMF Managing Director Lagarde noted recently, '_the most effective way of boosting jobs is to get growth going again '\u00a6 an additional percentage point of growth in the world's advanced economies would lower unemployment there by about half of a percentage point, pulling over 4 million people back into jobs. So, in order to create jobs, we must lift economic growth. How can this be done? In the near term, there is no doubt that it will take smart monetary and fiscal policy to protect the recovery.'\u009d _ Of course, the finding that Okun's Law holds does not in itself completely determine the course of policy action; that requires, as Nobel-laureate [Peter Diamond stated at the IMF's annual research conference, also looking carefully at relationships such as the Beveridge Curve'the relationship between jobs and vacancies'and other indicators of mismatch in the labor market. But the alleged breakdown of Okun's Law is often a jumping-off point for arguing that structural reforms are needed to make a major dent in unemployment. Our results suggest that while there may be good reasons to recommend structural reforms to boost employment, proposing them in the belief that Okun's Law has broken down should not be one of them.

Not sure about the U.S. part, I'll leave that to others. But, as for China, this seems quite a stretch. Could be the pundits are erring in blaming the market slide on China, or perhaps the markets are misreading news coming out of China. The purported China trigger was a survey of manufacturers. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell somewhat, crossing the magic threshold from expansion to contraction. PMIs are useful, but let's not get carried away. China's PMI is not the best indicator for growth, the decline was rather small, and January and February data (because of the Lunar 'Chinese'\u009d New Year) are hard to interpret. In early January, we actually _raised _our forecast for China's growth in 2014. Specifically, from 7\u00c2? percent projection made in October to 7\u00c2? percent. The subsequently published 2013 data'7.7 percent annual growth'matched our expectation and we reaffirm our forecast for 7\u00c2? percent growth in 2014. So, yes, we see a moderate slowing in China's economy. This is expected, indeed welcome, as China moves to a more inclusive, green, and sustainable growth path (see '[China: Why Less is More'\u009d). Our projection is for growth to slow 0.2 percentage points. This is peanuts for an economy growing at 7\u00c2? percent. And, given the momentum in domestic demand and improved outlook in advanced economies, growth this year could very well be higher. Specifically, we expect domestic demand to moderate as the government implements its recently announced economic blueprint. While containing the risks from rapidly expanding credit and rising local government debt will put the economy on sounder footing, it will also be a modest drag on domestic activity. This is a good tradeoff for securing long-term growth. Thus, buried in our forecasts is a slowing of domestic demand'over \u00c2? percentage point'partly offset by rising net exports fueled by the global recovery. Global markets are understandably interested in developments in China. It is the world's second largest economy and a critical source of global demand, especially for commodity producers. Continued healthy growth is thus important for both China and the world. Healthy growth, moreover, likely means a gradually slowing economy. Slowing to the fastest sustainable growth rate possible, which we estimate would be around 6 percent on average between now and 2030. In this case, China would continue to boost living standards at home while providing welcome support to the world economy for many years to come.

This question is especially on people's minds today, given the risks of deflation in advanced economies and of sustained turbulence in emerging markets. Despite these risks, we expect that the region will grow a little faster than last year'increasing from 2.6 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 2014. Stronger global demand is one part of the story, but not the whole story; volatility is likely to be a significant feature of the landscape ahead. And regional growth rates will still be in low gear compared to historical trends, and downside risks to growth remain. So, let's start with the global scene. As we described in our recent [_World Economic Outlook Update_, we expect global economic growth to rise from 3 percent in 2013 to 3\u00c2\u00be percent this year, led by the advanced economies. U.S. growth would rise to 2.8 percent in 2014, as headwinds from overly tight fiscal policy and damaged household balance sheets fade, with a continued push from still-loose monetary policy and cyclical forces. Meanwhile, we see the euro area shifting from recession to recovery'following last year's contraction, activity would expand by 1 percent. That said, the euro area recovery will be uneven, with economies under stress from high debt likely to see only a modest pickup. We see emerging markets and developing countries as a group a bit stronger, with overall growth around 5 percent this year. China's outlook is particularly key for Latin America's commodity exporters. We see it growing at about the same as last year, 7.5 percent, as policies to slow credit growth and raise the cost of capital take the steam out of surging investment. Meanwhile, commodity prices are expected to drop somewhat, especially for nonfuel items, where we see prices declining by about 6 percent over the year. Conditions in global financial markets will stay tighter than they were before the U.S. central bank's '[taper talk'\u009d in the first half of 2013, translating into higher international borrowing costs, particularly with the recent volatility in emerging markets. **Uneven recovery** [So, what does this revised forecast imply for our region? The picture varies across subregions, depending on the ways each is linked to the global economy and financial markets. For example, thanks to the U.S. recovery, **Mexico**'s growth rate would rise to 3 percent in 2014. Mexico will experience both a bounce in manufacturing exports and the ongoing recovery in domestic demand, as the temporary factors that depressed demand last year continue to wane. In **Central America**, stronger global demand will boost tourism and exports, and U.S. construction activity will give a lift to remittances (already growing 6.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2013). For Central America as a whole, we see growth rising from 2.9 percent to 3.2 percent this year. That said, high public debt and budget deficits are a constraint and risk to the outlook for some Central American countries. In the **Caribbean**, we expect the tourism-dependent countries to recover on the back of rising U.S. activity; U.S. tourist traffic to the Caribbean was up some 7 percent year-on-year in November. That said, growth would remain low in 2014'just 1\u00c2? percent. Caribbean commodity exporters would enjoy stronger growth at 3.7 percent. But for some Caribbean countries, as in Central America, elevated public debt poses risks. In **South America**, the picture is more mixed. For the large, financially- open commodity exporters (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay), average growth would remain just under 4 percent, remaining in low gear by historical standards. The uplift from global demand will be counterbalanced by weaker commodity prices and somewhat tighter financial conditions. Among these countries, domestic conditions will matter a lot for the outlook. For example, Brazil is running up against supply bottlenecks that are constraining output and pushing up inflation, so we see its growth no higher than last year, 2.3 percent. For other commodity exporters in the region, the picture is less favorable. In Argentina and Venezuela, pressures on inflation, the balance of payments, and foreign exchange markets developed in 2013. These pressures are weighing on confidence and aggregate supply. **New (and old) risks** And for all the countries in our region, the global economy still holds risks. Very low inflation in advanced economies could cause inflation expectations to drift downward, generating rising real interest rates (with short term rates near zero) or deflation in those economies. In addition, weaker emerging markets growth could hit commodity markets. Financial stability risks include rising corporate leverage, as well as pressure on asset valuations if interest rates rise more than expected. Also, sustained turbulence in emerging markets could tighten global financial conditions further. Indeed, and a little paradoxically, we have fairly high confidence that the outlook features a lot of uncertainty. We see several major shifts going on in the global economy, such as the growth handoff from emerging markets to advanced countries, the unwinding of stimulus in advanced countries (and the Fed's move towards the 'exit'\u009d from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy), and the rebalancing in China. Each of these shifts could present speed-bumps that could trigger volatility. So policymakers will need frameworks that are flexible, nimble, and resilient to ride out any shocks that might emerge. In sum, while growth is picking up, we should expect more turbulence for our region. Hence, policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean should not rest easy just yet. Rebuilding fiscal buffers, and using monetary policy and flexible exchange rates to absorb shocks where possible, remains the order of the day. Steps to strengthen medium-term economic policy frameworks would be helpful in some countries as well. Keeping a close eye on financial systems for signs of strain will be essential too. And finally, structural reforms to education, infrastructure, labor, and product markets will need to be pursued'throughout the region, including in the United States'to move growth to a higher and more sustainable pace over time.

First the good news. Growth is finally picking up in the euro area as it is slowly emerging from the deep recession. The bad news? Still nearly 20 million people are unemployed. Until the effects on employment have been reversed, we cannot say that the crisis is over. Two trends are particularly troubling, now and for the future. First, the high level of long-term unemployment gives me great cause for concern: almost half of those without a job have been unemployed for more than a year. Second, I still worry about the large number of young people without jobs: nearly one quarter of Europeans under the age of 25 who are looking for a job cannot find one. In Italy and Portugal, more than one third of under-25s are unemployed, and in Spain and Greece more than one half are. **Jobs and growth'a two way street** [ IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde discussing the new book at an event at the European Policy Centre. A [new book called \"Jobs and Growth: Supporting the European Recovery,\" authored by IMF staff, analyzes today's challenges head-on and proposes a roadmap for the continent's recovery.The book and its roadmap should contribute to the ongoing debate around these pressing issues. The book's analysis is informed by the relationship between jobs and growth, which is the proverbial two-way street. When unemployment is high, growth is slow because people consume less, and firms invest and hire less. This means that the most effective way of boosting jobs is to get growth going again. By some estimates, an additional percentage point of growth in the world's advanced economies would lower unemployment there by about half of a percentage point, pulling over 4 million people back into jobs. So, in order to create jobs, we must lift economic growth. How can this be done? In the near term, there is no doubt that it will take smart monetary and fiscal policy to protect the recovery. **Roadmap for recovery'three priorities** But what next? The new book's roadmap for recovery highlights three medium- and long-term priorities.** ** **For the euro area, I believe that enhancing the institutional framework of the monetary union is urgent.** Putting in place all of the elements of a banking union would be an excellent place to start. This would ensure the continued stability of the financial sector and address spillover effects from potential instability. The capacity to undertake a timely, effective, and least cost resolution of ailing banks with a common backstop will help break the adverse link between banks and sovereigns, where government support for a weak banking sector calls into question the sustainability of public debt, which feeds back into concerns about the strength of the banking sector, which typically has large holdings of government debt. It will also go a long way toward reducing the uncertainty of investors. **As a second priority, households, corporates, and ultimately also the public sector need to reduce high debt levels**. A lasting pick-up in growth will remain out of reach until the balance sheet legacies of the crisis are addressed. Given the slow pace of global demand growth, there is'unfortunately'little hope that these sectors will simply grow out of their debt problems. This means they face increased pressure to deleverage, to actively reduce their debt through higher savings, which threatens the recovery. IMF analysis indicates that high levels of private sector debt may be particularly problematic and should therefore be addressed first. Private sector deleveraging today can support self-sustained growth later on. Depending on country circumstances, policymakers might be able to do this by putting in place or reinforcing appropriate microstructures, such as effective insolvency frameworks'featuring, for example, fast and flexible personal and corporate bankruptcy proceedings'to help avoid lengthy periods of deleveraging and to protect growth. Government debt also has to come down. In a lower-growth environment, the trick is to move gradually as long as markets allow, with policies anchored by a durable commitment to sustain fiscal consolidation at a steady but reasonable pace over the medium-term. In addition, consolidation should be seen as an opportunity to make budgets more growth friendly, for example, by shifting from direct to indirect taxation. Turning to the third priority, **product and labor market reforms can make a significant contribution to realizing a country's full growth potential**. Being nimble and competitive opens up new opportunities in a world where production processes increasingly span more than one country. The Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia'which established themselves as important intermediate producers for the German automobile industry'are good examples of how integrating into a supply chain can, over time, enhance domestic value added and growth. Importantly, structural reforms tend to have the greatest impact when they are undertaken in a way that is comprehensive instead of piecemeal. I am well aware, of course, that reform priorities and design will vary widely across countries. For example, reducing structural rigidities in the German services sector'including via a review and harmonization of entry requirements in professional services'can help boost productivity there and spur domestic demand. Meanwhile, in Spain, recent labor market reforms show signs of success. The road ahead is certainly challenging, and different views exist on what policymakers should do'kick-starting and sustaining growth is a complex challenge that requires action on many fronts. It is a debate that engages us all because it affects us all'every citizen, in Europe and beyond.

At the next summit of the Group of Twenty advanced and emerging economies, to be held in Brisbane in November, political leaders will take the pulse of the global financial regulatory reform agenda, launched five years ago. The explicit goal of the Australian G-20 presidency is to finally complete these essential reforms. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott said today in Davos, 'Financial regulation is always a work-in-progress, but these reforms now need to be finalized in ways that promote confidence without eliminating risk.'\u009d I strongly support this extra push to create a safer financial system that can better support the needs of the real economy, and better protect taxpayers. For far too long, critics have been able to portray the G-20 reform agenda as a regulatory supertanker stuck in the shallow waters of technical complexity, financial industry pushback, and diverging national views. This image is increasingly off the mark. I believe the reform process has gradually moved the global financial system to a better place. It is now safer than before the crisis'but not yet safe enough. This is why I believe policymakers should particularly focus on one of the key unfinished reforms'the too-important-to-fail problem. **Too-important-to-fail taking too long to fix** The prime example of progress in reforming the global financial system are the Basel III regulations that make banks more resilient by requiring them to maintain higher and better capital and liquidity. The design of these rules is largely complete, and the focus is now shifting to the nitty-gritty of their implementation by countries. Other key planks of the G-20 agenda may be less advanced, but are also moving in the right direction. They include reforms to resolve the too-important-to- fail problem, address risks in shadow banking, and make derivatives markets safer. The notable laggard is accounting standards reform, which has been stuck in low gear for too long. I believe the success of this ambitious reform package will depend in large part on its ability to address too-important-to-fail. By removing this Damoclean sword hanging over the modern financial system, policymakers could score an epic financial stability victory. As [Ben Bernanke, the outgoing chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, put it: 'Too-big-to-fail was a major part of the source of the crisis. And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don't address that problem successfully.'\u009d At the heart of this issue lies the expectation that governments will stand behind systemically important financial institutions in times of trouble. These institutions can reap the benefits of this implicit public subsidy through artificially lower funding costs, excessive risk taking, and taxpayer- funded bailouts. Policymakers have sought to shrink this implicit public subsidy by reducing the likelihood and cost of bank distress or failure. For example: * Global systemically important banks are now subject to intensified supervision and additional capital requirements, on top of Basel III levels. * In key economies, including the United States, the European Union, and Japan, rules require systemically important institutions to prepare 'living wills'\u009d to facilitate their resolution if they fail, and minimize taxpayer involvement in this process. * Several advanced economies want to [reduce the size and complexity of banks through measures that directly impose limits on the scope of banks' businesses, including the Volcker rule in the United States, the Vickers reform in the United Kingdom, and the forthcoming European Union regulation based on the Liikanen proposals. Despite these efforts, implicit subsidies to these systemically important financial institutions remain too large. We are working on new analysis of the implicit subsidies provided to these institutions that we will publish in April, so stay tuned. **Focus on bank resolution** I believe policymakers should focus on one of the key unfinished elements of the too-important-to-fail reforms'bank resolution, especially across borders. It is astonishing that officials in countries are still largely ill-equipped to deal with a Lehman Brothers-style bankruptcy, where assets and liabilities are scattered across multiple jurisdictions and entities. Over the past year or so, we have seen some progress in this area, including agreements on the European Union's bank recovery and resolution directive, and the planned European single resolution mechanism. We have also seen the continuing implementation of the United States' Dodd-Frank legislation and the agreement in principle by officials in the United States and the United Kingdom to address cross-border resolution. The latter initiative is particularly relevant for the biggest U.S. banks, which hold almost 70 percent of their on and off-balance sheet foreign assets in the United Kingdom. The 'London whale'\u009d incident was a reminder that the U.K.-based derivatives activities of U.S. banks remain significant. But policymakers have yet to do much of the heavy lifting. For example, they need to remove legal obstacles to cross-border resolution in areas such as derivatives and national insolvency regimes. They also need to reach agreement on the amount, nature, and location of 'bail-in-able'\u009d bank debt that should be available to absorb losses. More broadly, cross-border resolution requires an unprecedented level of trust among officials in different countries. Building this mutual trust'through strong cooperation and uncompromising implementation of agreed reforms'would go a long way toward ending too-important-to-fail. It would also help avoid the risk of a gradual balkanization of global finance, because officials would be less likely to ring-fence the operations of global systemically important banks within national borders. **Supertanker still in refit** In the coming months, policymakers should heed the call to action by the Australian G-20 presidency. By completing the reform agenda, they will make a major contribution to the global public good of financial stability, which underpins economic growth. But this regulatory supertanker is not yet ready to hit the high seas. The G-20 leaders should continue to fully support efforts by the Financial Stability Board to complete the reform agenda, and they should have the political will to implement it. The International Monetary Fund, in turn, will continue to contribute its resources and expertise to help address the remaining challenges, in collaboration with the Financial Stability Board and international standard setters. The IMF will also help its members implement the new rules in the coming years through surveillance and technical assistance. In the short term, however, all eyes will be on the G-20 summit. What was developed and nurtured in the meeting rooms of Basel should come to fruition in Brisbane.

We lowered our 2013 growth forecast for emerging markets and developing economies by a whopping 0.5 percentage points compared to our earlier forecast. Some argued that we were too pessimistic. Others said that we should have stuck with the lower-growth scenario we had devised at the onset of the global financial crisis. Fast forward to today. Indeed, most recent figures indicate that the engines of global growth'emerging markets and developing economies'have slowed significantly. Their growth rate dropped about 3 percentage points in 2013 from 2010 levels, with more than two thirds of countries seeing a decline' Brazil, China, and India lead the pack. This is important for the global economy, since these economies generate half of today's global economic activity. In my more recent travels around the world'five regions on three continents'I received the same questions everywhere: what is happening with the emerging markets? Is the slowdown permanent? Can emerging markets boost their growth? What are the downside risks? **No major pickup in emerging markets and developing economies' growth.** Emerging markets and developing economies are now stabilizing, but don't expect their growth rate to bounce back anytime soon to the high levels we observed in the past decade. In fact, we forecast a moderate pickup in emerging and developing economy growth to 5.1 percent this year, and to 5.4 percent in 2015. [ One key reason is that several tailwinds that supported growth in the past are fading: * We estimate China's decades-long double-digit growth rate, which supported its trading partners' growth, to have slowed to an average of 7.7 percent in the last two years. * Commodity price surges, which have helped resource-rich countries, have ended. * Historically easy financing conditions of the past have begun to give way to higher global interest rates. * The share of international trade in total output has shrunk in the past two years, with no sign of a significant reversal to catch up with the upward trend observed in the past decade. **Structural changes in the global economy are fundamentally affecting the emerging markets and developing economies.** China's rebalancing away from investment will have a significant long-term impact on many countries. We welcome a moderate slowdown in China because current investment levels are unsustainably high. Government policies are rightly geared toward reducing the share of investment in GDP by several percentage points over the next three to five years. [Our analysis suggests that a one percentage point cut in China's investment growth would subtract between one-half and nine-tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth in the regional supply chain. This would create a significant impact across a range of economic, trade, and financial variables among China's major trading partners and commodity exporters. Financial markets will likely be volatile for the foreseeable future. The main reason is that an orderly transition to a world without [unconventional central bank policies will likely face multiple challenges: * smooth adjustment of short-term interest rate expectations * gradual return to normal of the difference in yields on long-term and short-term bonds * smooth portfolio adjustments * gradual unwinding of excessive leveraging * continuously liquid markets, and * [economic growth gaining strength. The turmoil in financial markets in May 2013 after the U.S. Federal Reserve began to discuss its plans to slow the pace of buying government bonds is a case in point. At that time, interest rates increased even in Europe, even though there was no change in the health of their economies. **To keep up with this changing global environment, emerging market and developing economies have to continuously adjust their economic structures and economic policies. ** A stark example of how elusive persistent strong growth can be is the lack of convergence of Latin American economies toward advanced economies. This chart shows that this group's GDP made a full reverse circle between 1962 and 2011. Their per capita income has remained stagnant compared to the United States. In contrast, emerging market economies in Asia saw their relative per capita income improve continuously, with the notable exception of the period of the Asian crisis in the late 1990s. [ [ [ Current domestic policies are not sufficient for financial stability in many economies that depend on capital flows. Corporate balance sheets are overstretched in a number of others. Uncertainty about the shape and direction of policies and supply-side constraints, including inadequate infrastructure and regulations, inhibit much-needed investment. Demographic pressures including aging populations, and tense industrial relations do not help either. **How they can do it.** Building a strong economy rather than simply injecting more monetary or fiscal stimulus remains crucial. For example, Brazil should commit to the long- standing primary surplus target. India needs to restart the process of reducing government debt and deficits and supply-side reform to bring down inflation and achieve strong growth. Indonesia should reassert monetary policy's key role to provide a nominal anchor. Turkey should increase its saving rate. Better demand management is necessary but not sufficient for strong and sustainable growth. Governments also need to ensure strong productivity growth, including by promoting an environment for innovation. While there is no one recipe for enhancing productivity, our [work suggests countries should calibrate their reforms to their stage of development. For example, in upper-middle income countries, this would require further enhancing skills in the labor force and investing in research and development. Priorities in lower-middle income countries would include alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks and lowering barriers to foreign direct investment. In low-income countries the focus could be on strengthening economic institutions needed for market-based economic activity, getting more from agriculture, and improving basic education and infrastructure. Policymakers need to understand how policies in one part of the world affect everyone else since this will impact their decisions and actions, no matter which country they live in. To facilitate this, we have been highlighting key spillovers in our [reports. This also means [policy coordination in today's hyper-connected world is critical. The global fiscal stimulus at the onset of the global financial crisis is an important example. The need for coordination in the area of cross-border resolution of failing or troubled banks is another example. We encourage this kind of coordination every chance we get. The moderate pickup in global growth should not lead to complacency. We may not go back to the good old days. In all fairness, several emerging market and developing economies have implemented good policies in the aftermath of last May's turmoil. However, given the long and difficult list of policies required to achieve strong and sustained growth, any hesitancy in implementing them will complicate life for emerging economies in the future.

We are mourning a colleague, a friend to many of us, above all a dedicated civil servant who represented the best the Fund has to offer, and gave his life in the line of duty, helping the Afghan people. Our hearts go out to his family and to the many victims of this brutal attack. Let me now turn to our update of the World Economic Outlook and distill its three main messages: First, the recovery is strengthening. We forecast world growth to increase from 3% in 2013 to 3.7% in 2014. We forecast growth in advanced economies to increase from 1.3% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2014. And we forecast growth in emerging market and developing economies to increase from 4.7% in 2013 to 5.1% in 2014. Second, this recovery was largely anticipated. We have revised our forecast for world growth in 2014 by just 0.1% relative to our October forecast. The basic reason behind the stronger recovery is that the brakes to the recovery are progressively being loosened. The drag from fiscal consolidation is diminishing. The financial system is slowly healing. Uncertainty is decreasing. Third, it is still a weak and uneven recovery. Among advanced economies, it is stronger in the US than in Europe, stronger in the Euro core than in Southern Europe. In most advanced economies, unemployment remains much too high. And downside risks remain. **Tour d'horizon** With these remarks in mind, let me take you on the quick tour of the world. **United States**: US growth appears increasingly solid. Private demand is strong. As a result of the December budget agreement, fiscal consolidation, which weighted on growth in 2013, will be more limited in 2014. These factors lead us to forecast 2.8% growth for 2014, compared to 1.9% in 2013. While monetary policy remains very accommodative, the focus is increasingly turning to monetary policy exit, and we expect the policy rate to rise in 2015. **Japan**: Japan grew at 1.7% in 2013, and we forecast the same growth rate for 2014. This is good news. But this growth has come largely from fiscal stimulus and from exports. For growth to be sustained, consumption and investment have to take the relay. And the Japanese government will continue to face the challenge of achieving enough fiscal consolidation to reassure debt holders while not slowing down the recovery, a difficult challenge **Europe**: Conditions are increasingly favorable in the UK and the Euro core. Public debts are on sustainable paths, and fiscal consolidation is, rightly, slowing down. Credit conditions are favorable. ", "index": 376}, {"pub": "1/16/2014", "title": "U.S. Monetary Policy and Its Effects on Latin America", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6769", "content": " [By [Alejandro Werner (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol and [Portugu\u00c3\u00aas) Some basic realities seem to be getting lost in the debate over the Fed's 'exit'\u009d from unconventional monetary policy and its impact on Latin America. First, the still-loose stance makes sense. U.S. inflation is too low, the output gap too large, and the labor market too weak. And even during tapering, the Fed's stance will remain highly loose. The 10-year Treasury rate, adjusted for core inflation, is about 230 basis points below its 30-year average and the inflation-adjusted Fed funds rate is 320 basis points below. These rates are likely to remain below their 30-year average for at least the next two to three years. Second, these loose monetary conditions have tangible benefits for Latin America. A stance that supports growth and financial stability in the world's largest economy is good for the region, given its links to the United States. In turn, continued U.S. growth is positive for commodities demand, both directly from the U.S. and via other countries that benefit from U.S. growth. And finally, international financing conditions remain very favorable for Latin America'the average yield on sovereign debt is still about 250 basis points below its 16-year average. These conditions have allowed governments and business to refinance their liabilities and finance infrastructure and other investment at historically low rates. Moreover, several countries have been able to issue for the first time in international markets. That does not mean that countries in Latin America should rest easy. The volatility since May 2013 tells us that the process of normalization of U.S. monetary policy will be complicated and volatile. So it is smart to prepare for bumps. **How to prepare?****** First, continue to take advantage of loose financial conditions by refinancing debt at low rates and increasing maturities, while avoiding a significant expansion of domestic spending fueled by cheap credit. Second, start adjusting for the exit. The exit might entail rising long-term dollar interest rates, weakening regional currencies, lower flows of capital to the region (and in some cases, maybe outflows), with pressure in local financial markets. This will increase debt service and tighten financing costs, thus affecting investment and growth. And this might not unfold smoothly'we might see big swings in markets. So to prepare, countries should make sure that banks, governments, businesses and households have solid balance sheets. These strengths were stress tested in May/June and they withstood the shock. However, during that period, some signs of illiquidity in local currency bond markets appeared and asset price volatility was high. Thus, countries should also strengthen liquidity conditions in local markets. Another lesson from past bouts of volatility is that countries with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals tend to see more abrupt changes in capital flows and asset prices. Some concerns arise because since 2009 the region has seen a relaxation in fiscal policy, widening current account deficits and slowing growth. In addition, the slowdown underway might add to the differentiation markets will make as financial conditions get tighter, stressing the importance of structural reforms and sound fundamentals. Now is a good time to shore up fundamentals too, especially where fiscal buffers might be too thin. Finally, as the exit process will take time, it is important to use buffers wisely and keep one's powder dry. While there are certainly some concerns that the exit may be a bumpy ride, Latin America is better prepared than 10 or 20 years ago. Policies are better, banks are stronger, buffers are larger, the region is not excessively dependent on portfolio inflows, and the generalized adoption of flexible exchange rates makes a huge difference. More than two-thirds of the inflows have been accumulated as international reserves by central banks or as external assets by the private sector. During 2009-12, central banks in the region increased their reserve holdings by $304 billion and the private sector accumulated $266 billion in foreign assets (FDI and portfolio assets). The job now is making sure that this resilience is sufficient to handle a lot of volatility, and sufficient across a range of countries. A lot of talk implies that the Fed's edging toward the exit is a bad thing. The reality is that we should welcome the recent tapering announcement and, in the future, the beginning of the normalization of interest rates'it will come when the U.S. economic outlook is improving in earnest, which will be good news for Latin America. More importantly, it will be a step down the road toward putting the global financial crisis behind us once and for all.

Yet along with this success story has come a steady widening of the current account deficit, projected to come out at 7.4 percent of GDP in 2013. The counterpart of this deficit is a reliance on external financing, much of which is of a short-term nature, highlighting the Turkish economy's main problem at the moment. **_The external deficit presents a speed limit to economic growth_** In our recent [annual review of Turkey's economy, [regression analysis suggests that, barring a significant change in policies or the economic environment, the level of growth consistent with a stable current account is in the 2\u00c2\u00be - 3\u00c2? percent range. In other words, growth above this speed limit would lead to a wider current account deficit. This is why we argue that policies should aim at reducing the external deficit, as otherwise growth of 4 to 5 percent per year is unlikely to be sustainable. **_This speed limit can change_** Raising domestic savings ' both public and private ' would lower Turkey's dependence on external financing and hence its current account deficit. Policies should aim to improve competitiveness further through structural change. At the same time, monetary policy should tackle persistently above- target inflation that chips away at Turkey's competitiveness through real exchange rate appreciation. These are reforms that will take considerable time to bear fruit. Meanwhile, it will be important for the government to maintain flexibility in the budget. This will help cushion the volatile economy by enabling officials to adjust spending and taxation to the economic cycle. **_Policy recommendations to enable faster growth_** * _**Domestic savings: **_Recent reforms of the private pension system have increased participation and pension savings. They are a good step, on which officials could follow-up by providing more incentives for pension savings. More ambitious public savings targets in the over the next few years, akin to achievements before the global financial crisis, could also contribute. * **_Competitiveness: _**Turkey's structural policies should aim to improve the competitiveness of domestic goods relative to imports and move exports up the value chain. The strong growth in Turkey's export volume over the past decade has not made up for its high import needs. Moreover, growth in export value has started to lag behind the growth in export volume. The government should therefore focus policies on encouraging investments in higher-value-added export sectors, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and equipment. Such a move towards higher-technology activities will help maintain competitiveness, even as wage levels in Turkey continue to rise. Thus far, bottlenecks in the development of skills and education of the workforce and in innovation and research and development have acted as impediments to moving down this road. [ * _**Flexible Budget:** _The government should keep the budget flexible. This will lock in past fiscal gains by creating room for the government to adapt spending and taxation as economic circumstances change, and secure a higher and more stable public contribution to national savings. Turkey's fiscal effort in the last ten years has brought about an impressive reduction in debt and interest costs. The fiscal space created has allowed the government to boost social spending, leading to a strong improvement in social indicators. Yet, in recent years the share of non-discretionary primary spending'such as compensation to employees and transfers to social security'has grown rapidly. With revenues strongly dependent on output growth, the loss of flexibility in primary expenditure has become a source of concern. It reduces the capacity of fiscal policy to react nimbly to economic shocks and ultimately to achieve a higher level of public savings. Likewise, growing primary expenditure rigidities could undermine hard-won fiscal discipline. In fact, while Turkey has over-performed in terms of overall fiscal targets in the past, officials have systematically exceeded spending ceilings set in the medium-term fiscal plan, exposing weaknesses in public financial management practices. **_Policies for a flexible budget_** To preserve a flexible budget, Turkey should restrain spending growth and improve existing budgetary procedures. To do so, there are five main policy options the Turkish authorities have at their disposal: contain the public employment growth rate; introduce more flexible public wage indexation mechanisms; renew efforts to reform the pension system; save over-performance in revenues; and undertake a gradual move to a more binding spending ceiling framework, including a mechanism to adjust for past deviations. A combination of these policies would help the government maintain budget flexibility and hence preserve the fiscal gains achieved over the past decade.

This is another reminder of how susceptible these economies remain to economic conditions outside their borders. Much of the market movements to date have been short term in nature. But emerging markets know the end-game ' interest rates in advanced economies will eventually go up, reducing the cheap external financing they have benefited from until now. And this is not the only external factor weighing on the growth prospects of emerging markets. **A less supportive global environment** We do not expect growth in advanced economies to return to the levels of the pre-2008 credit-fueled boom. There is also little evidence that another commodity boom will boost the fortunes of commodity exporters. In short, the supportive external environment that propelled emerging markets during the pre-crisis years has either already died down or, in the case of easy external financing, will do so soon. In a previous [blog we showed that external factors account for a considerable part of the slowdown in emerging market economies during 2011 and 2012. But how will these external forces materially affect growth over the next three to five years? Which countries are most affected, and can policies play a role? Using a large database that covers over three decades, we explored how changes in external conditions affect growth. We found that the combination of higher interest rates, lower commodity prices, and lower growth in advanced economies are likely to shave off around 1 percent of growth for an emerging market economy in the middle of the range in terms of trade and financial openness (stay tuned for more details in an upcoming paper). However, the impact will differ depending on a country's circumstances and policies. **Growth and external conditions ** Emerging market economies that derive a higher share of GDP from exports are more susceptible to changes in growth in other economies. A decline in external demand triggers a dual blow to exports and to investment into export- oriented sectors. We found that for a representative emerging market economy, growth would decline by around \u00c2\u00be percent for each percent of lower growth in its trading partners. By the same token, countries that are more financially integrated are more susceptible to changes in world interest rates. Foreign-financed expenditure dries up, dragging down the rest of the economy. The effect is sizeable'a one percentage point increase in U.S. real interest rates shaves off around 0.1 percent of growth in emerging markets. Sudden changes or shocks in the price of imports relative to the price of its exports'known as the terms of trade' have an important medium-term effect on exporters of mineral commodities. Interestingly, countries that do rely on the export of these commodities are not affected to the same degree, which we trace to two differences. First, mineral commodity exporters exhibit higher concentration in economic activity, and capital specific to mineral extraction cannot be quickly reallocated to other sectors in the wake of changes in commodity prices. More diversified economies, on the other hand, can cushion the blow to one sector by reallocating less specialized resources to other sectors. Second, in the wake of a commodity price boom, few recognize that what goes up must eventually come down. The economy launches into a spending spree, often borrowing against future commodity revenues. And when export prices reverse, the country is forced to retrench dramatically, exacerbating the swings in terms of trade. **The role of policies** So the fortunes of emerging market economies shift with external conditions. But policies have a role to play in buffering the impact of these forces. Countries' room to maneuver will depend on how they managed their economic policy during the boom years. Countries with a floating exchange rate regime are less susceptible to changes in world interest rates. A country with an exchange rate pegged to another country's currency and an open capital account effectively imports that other country's monetary policy. A monetary tightening in advanced economies will necessarily translate into higher domestic rates. So the floating exchange rate is the first line of defense against external shocks. It matters how countries manage capital flows during periods of low interest rates and easy money. We find evidence that episodes of growth financed through the deterioration of the current account are followed by periods of lower growth. The way to avoid high current account deficits and associated credit booms is by offsetting non-resident capital inflows with simultaneous resident capital outflows, which could then be drawn upon in the event of a reversal of capital inflows. The IMF's [_World Economic Outlook_ shows that counter-cyclical fiscal policies, inflation targeting regimes, flexible exchange rates, and better overall institutions are most conducive to good management of these flows. For commodity-dependent emerging markets, prospects will depend on how much of their windfall countries saved during the boom years. We find that once we account for the effect of public expenditure, the reaction of medium-term growth to changes in terms of trade is greatly reduced. As [documented in this blog by Adler and Sosa, a more measured response of public expenditure to commodity price increases both ensures fiscal sustainability and tames the exuberance of the private sector, which prevents a hard landing when the country's luck runs out. The next few years present formidable challenges to emerging market economies, and one should not expect a return of the very high growth rates of the last decade. Many emerging market economies have the tools to navigate the harsher environment and make the best of it. Our upcoming paper on growth in emerging markets, which follows the [emerging markets seminar at the 2013 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings, will delve into the details.

Having gone through massive turmoil in 2012, Mali is emerging successfully, thanks to the perseverance and fortitude of its people. Parliamentary and presidential elections have been held, and the newly elected government has put forth a new economic program aimed at increasing growth and reducing poverty. [ International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde visits a primary school January 10, 2014 in Bamako, Mali. Lagarde is on a two country visit to Africa.

Social indicators, while admittedly still low, had also posted real progress. Primary school enrollment had reached 70 percent of all children; male and female literacy rates had doubled; child mortality had been almost halved; and the poverty rate was down. These were impressive achievements. The challenge now is to ensure that Mali returns to this positive trajectory. I came away confident that it will be able to do it. Mali's government leaders told me that with the political situation settled and national reconciliation underway, the focus is now on getting the economy back on track.

Unleashing that potential will require concerted action along three key areas'what I called the 'Three Ps'\u009d. * **First, Public investment.** Mali has huge investment needs and the fiscal space for the necessary spending needs to be created. This will require action to increase revenues, address inefficient energy subsidies, and tackle governance and public financial management issues. This requires stepping up efforts to fight corruption in a resolute and sustained manner. * **Second, Private investment**. Supporting entrepreneurship is a key component of Mali's development. The necessary pre-conditions need to be in place. In a country where only 10 percent of the population has a bank account, greater financial sector development and a stronger business environment will be powerful factors to promote initiatives. * **Third, Participation for all**. To my mind, it is crucial to increase investment in the country's greatest potential'its people. Growth in Mali must be more equitable and more inclusive. This means that all sectors in Mali's economy, as well as all actors'men and women'should have access to opportunity, including in the education sector and participate in the benefits of growth. Women, in particular, can and should play a key role in unlocking Mali's potential.

As part of the new constitution, Kenya is transitioning to a new form of devolved government. This process carries significant risks, and careful implementation is crucial to enable all parts of Kenya to gain access to fiscal resources and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread more equitably. * The second 'C'\u009d: _closing_ infrastructure gaps. Kenya still has large infrastructure needs. Investment in roads, railways, power generation, and all of the other sinews of a modern economy is all the more important for the country to take-off. The country's new-found natural resources wealth'properly and transparently used' offers an opportunity to invest for growth and job creation. * The third 'C'\u009d: _continuing_ regional integration.

The public sector is already overburdened in most countries. But what is not clear is how to support the private sector for it to play this important role. To shed some light on how to facilitate strong job creation and growth by the private sector in the Middle East and North Africa, we held a conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in December 2013, jointly with the Council of Saudi Chambers and the International Finance Corporation. As the date of the conference approached, registrations kept increasing, and by the time we opened the conference, the registration numbers had skyrocketed to more than 800! I can think of no better sign of the importance of this topic for the people in this region. The discussions were very informative and intense. So much so that we ran out of time for questions and answers after every panel, and the discussion spilled over to coffee breaks and gatherings on the sidelines. Let me highlight the main issues that I took away and featured highly during the conference. **Weak business environment** Private sector investment in the region is weak, averaging about 15 percent of GDP over the past three decades compared to nearly 20 percent in South Asia and 30 percent in East Asia. Why is that the case? Well, complex and burdensome regulations in the region seem to hold back investment and, hence, job creation and growth. Despite government steps to address some issues, there is, quite simply, still too much red tape. Let me give you some examples. According to the World Bank, it takes 74 days to start a business in Iraq, 75 days to register a property in Morocco, 159 days to get electricity in Algeria, and 218 days to get a construction permit in Egypt. For Korea, the same procedures take 7, 11, 28, and 29 days, respectively. Another factor is that bank credit to the private sector is quite low'a privileged group of borrowers, mainly large companies, receives the bulk of the funds. According to the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, only 10 percent of firms in the region finance their investment through banks, while 36 percent of firms identify access to finance as a major constraint. We've also examined a decade's worth of data that show economic volatility has been high in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa. A stable economic environment and a robust financial system are necessary for private sector growth. Low inflation and limited year-to-year variability in economic growth create certainty for businesses, and encourage them to invest and create jobs. A weak business environment results in a large informal economy characterized by low-pay, low-productivity jobs in firms that have limited access to finance, and limited growth prospects. This inevitably results in the benefits of economic growth being less inclusive. **Enabling business environment** Governments need to reform policies to make it easier to start and to manage a business. This will go a long way toward allowing entrepreneurial spirit to flourish, including for small and medium'sized enterprises. The agenda to improve the business environment includes: 1. simple, transparent, and evenhanded treatment of companies 2. public institutions that are more transparent and accountable 3. equal access for all to government services, adequate skill-building and incentives for employment 4. better access to finance to help spur entrepreneurship and private investment; and 5. better infrastructure. Equally important to the business climate is clarity and security about rules and their enforcement. In addition, business people need to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This means overcoming vested interests which often stand in the way of fully harnessing the ingenuity of the private sector and creating open opportunity for all. No doubt, improved macroeconomic policies are essential to create an enabling environment where the private businesses can thrive and operate with confidence. Low inflation and less volatile economic growth create a more conducive environment for businesses, and encourage them to invest and create jobs. Sound monetary policy and prudent fiscal policy can ensure that. The Middle East needs a more dynamic private sector to meet the aspirations of its people. The reforms to achieve this are often complex, politically difficult, and take time to pay off. Nevertheless, beginning the process is vital for restoring confidence, propelling private sector activity forward, and creating much-needed jobs.

Following my most recent visit to Pakistan I noticed there seem to be many different and contradictory views about the government's reform agenda supported by the IMF program. This piece addresses some of the key concerns on people's minds. 1\\. The IMF dictated the content of the program. **The government mostly produced the policies supported in this program, which respond to key challenges facing Pakistan today. ** The economic section of the PML-N [party manifesto shows that most of the policies agreed with the IMF were actually those proposed by Prime Minister Sharif and his team before the elections, such as: fiscal consolidation, tax reform, measures to tackle the energy crisis, restructuring and privatizations of public sector enterprises, trade policy reforms, and steps to boost the investment climate. 2\\. The program doesn't address some important problems. **The [program can't do everything, but it tackles Pakistan's biggest economic issues as quickly as possible.** Many have questioned particular parts of the program. Some feel the program should do more to improve tax collections, or to cut corruption, or to reform the civil service, or to boost provincial tax revenues. These are certainly important issues but given time and capacity constraints we can't focus on everything immediately. The government and the IMF agreed the most important issues were: (1) the very large fiscal deficit, which could no longer be financed; (2) the critically low level of international reserves; and (3) the need for structural reforms'particularly in the energy sector'to get the economy out of the low- growth trap it has been mired in for years. The program aggressively tackles all three'the deficit will come down from 8 percent of GDP to around 3\u00c2? percent of GDP over 3 years, international reserves will be rebuilt to sustainable levels, and structural bottlenecks will be significantly eased. Once the government addresses these core issues they can tackle other important challenges, but without stabilization first, the economy will be too unstable to support the other efforts. 3\\. The program may address the right issues, but in the wrong order. **With the economy in serious trouble, Pakistan didn't have the luxury of postponing key stabilization measures. ** Some have argued the program errs in focusing first on economic stabilization and then on growth. Others wanted to focus on improved tax collections before increases in tax rates. Likewise, some feel that energy supply should have been increased first, with tariff increases later. Let's take these in turn. If Pakistan wanted to postpone its stabilization efforts to focus on growth stimulus, how would the government pay for the postponement? And how would it finance the stimulus? Unlike the United States, which can sustain very large deficits because the world is willing to buy U.S. government bonds, Pakistan doesn't have this luxury. Moreover, even if you could finance it, how effective will temporary stimulus be if investors know the government has not yet addressed underlying imbalances? On improving tax collections and energy supply improvements, these reforms take years to bear fruit. Tax administration reforms will take 2-3 years to generate significant improvements in revenues. Energy supply enhancements can take even longer. So while it was essential to start those at the beginning of the program, the government made the wise decision to include quick wins early on to address the vulnerabilities while the reforms with longer gestation periods are ramping up. 4\\. IMF policies will hurt the poor, who will pay the brunt of the adjustment. **The program will broaden the tax base, and cut subsidies for the rich, while maintaining low energy prices for the lowest consumers and increasing public spending on the poorest.** In this program, deficit reduction will come not from cutting education and health programs, but mostly from raising revenues. This involves bringing people into the tax net by eliminating loopholes and special privileges, and by improving tax administration and enforcement. In Pakistan, a country of 180 million people, only 1.2 million individuals and firms file income tax returns, of which about half are corporate filers. That must change so that more of the burden falls on those who can most afford to pay. Energy subsidies mostly benefit a small proportion of the population. The wealthiest are those who consume the most energy, so an across-the-board subsidy helps them most. The rest of the population has to endure 8-10 hours a day of load shedding during the summer months without being able to afford the private generators of the rich. Under the program, the lowest consumption levels will continue to be subsidized, while prices will go up to fully cover costs for the wealthiest. Energy supply will be better and load-shedding will fall. The program also includes higher social spending. The 2013/14 budget includes a significant rise in education spending. The program also entails a large increase in targeted transfers to the poorest, through the expansion of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), a national cash-transfer scheme. The government will expand the program with the help of donors, which currently reaches 4.9 million households, to reach 6.6 million families. The stipend has increased by about 20 percent, and it will be adjusted for inflation in the future. 5\\. The program will generate recession; hurt the economy and the business sector. **Growth will initially fall, but will be much higher over time.** In the short-run it is true that fiscal adjustment will reduce growth. But continued instability would hurt growth much more by pushing the economy into crisis. The government has geared its structural reforms to enhance growth in the medium- and long-term. These reforms include measures to ease the energy bottlenecks that strangle economic activity, and steps to promote trade, improve the business climate and the competitiveness of Pakistani industry. More efficiency and competition will help generate more investment and millions of new domestic jobs. 6\\. This program is doomed to fail as did previous programs. **While success is by no mean guaranteed, this is an historic chance to fix long-standing economic problems and put the country on a higher growth path. ** The government's program aims to overhaul some of the structural deficiencies that have plagued the country's economic prospects, while pursuing, at the same time sound macroeconomic policies and protecting the most vulnerable from the effects of fiscal consolidation, through the expansion of social safety nets. Program design has been adjusted to take into consideration the lessons of past failures and the IMF is willing to be flexible to adapt to unexpected developments. Support from other institutions is being mobilized to help. Prospects for success are enhanced by a democratically elected government firmly committed to doing what it needs to do to fix these long-standing problems and achieve its objective of making life better for 180 million Pakistanis.

The slowdown reflects not just inadequate global demand, but also structural factors that are rendering previous growth engines less effective, and the fact that economic 'good times'\u009d reduced the incentives to implement further reforms to enhance productivity. With the end of the period of favorable global financing and trade conditions, the time is nigh for governments to make strong efforts to [increase productivity'the essential foundation of sustainable growth and rising living standards. **Wanted: A Second Generation of Reforms** Governments should focus on the next wave of structural policy reforms to increase competition and improve how markets function. In most emerging market economies, improvements in productivity growth will be linked to their ability to 'climb the technology ladder,'\u009d that is to move away from reliance on cheap, low-margin goods to more value-added manufactured goods potentially offering higher profits. This will mean implementing reforms that encourage resources to relocate from lower productivity activities, for example, agriculture, toward higher value- added manufacturing activities as well as more modern services activities such as transportation, distribution, and information and communication technology. Here are some examples of reforms that are likely to have the highest payoffs for emerging market economies: **Real sector reform** * _Improve the business environment._ Reforms should focus on reducing administrative burdens, simplifying regulations, strengthening competition, and cutting red-tape. Heavy regulation often discourages international participation in the domestic economy, which limits a country from benefiting from knowledge transfers from abroad. * _Remove labor market distortions and rigidities._ Rigid hiring and firing and employment protection regulations tend to encourage the proliferation of small, informal and generally less productive firms. They also give rise to distortions including labor markets with protected 'insiders'\u009d and vulnerable 'outsiders.'\u009d Reforms should encourage firms to move away from the informal sector to the formal sector and from low productivity to high productivity sectors and new activities, while providing a safety net to protect workers during the process of adjustment. * _Liberalize foreign direct investment._ Regulations limiting foreign direct investment can hinder the adoption of technologies by reducing competition, preventing technology transfers between countries, and hampering the entry of new firms. Dismantling these barriers can create productivity gains for the economy as a whole. **Financial sector reform** * _Ease financial restrictions_. Removing interest rate ceilings and controls on credit, and introducing stronger regulatory and supervisory frameworks to curb unsound financial market practices will allow capital to flow to where it will get the highest return while minimizing systemic risks. * _Develop local capital markets._ Improvements such as developing local capital markets, in particular local currency bond markets, can increase the availability of financing for long-term and innovative investments. Governments should also invest in people's skills. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's scores that measure performance in reading, mathematics, and science show large gaps between emerging and advanced economies, suggesting a significant payoff from investing in higher education. Infrastructure should not be neglected. Despite impressive progress in some areas such as telecommunications, many emerging market economies have deficient transportation and communications networks and little capacity to generate their own energy. Reforming the regulatory environment for infrastructure, and promoting public-private partnerships would help attract private investment to help fix some of these problems. Better infrastructure, for example roads, railways, ports and airports, can improve firms'ability to connect to domestic and foreign markets, and increase competitiveness and efficiency which would have a significant impact on productivity and growth. **Reform will not be easy** While most emerging market economies know what reforms they need to enact, implementing them will not be easy. Policymakers will have to contend with resistance from vested interests that have grown rich and powerful from the status quo. Moreover, adopting reforms while the economy is experiencing lower growth and the government has less money to spend on reforms will be more difficult. A weak fiscal position makes it harder to find the resources needed to provide adequate compensation for those who stand to lose from structural reforms. Governments with limited political capital may opt to 'spend'\u009d it to reduce government debt and deficits rather than to reform the way the economy works. Ultimately though, how different emerging market economies reconcile competing interests to implement necessary reforms will determine their prospects.

Ostry, and [Atish R. Ghosh International policy coordination is like the Loch Ness monster: much discussed but rarely seen. Going back over the decades, and even further in history to the period between the Great Wars, coordination efforts have been episodic. Coordination seems to occur spontaneously in turbulent periods, when the world faces the prospect of some calamitous outcome and the key players are seeking to avoid cascading negative spillovers. In quieter times, coordination is rarer'though not unheard of; the Louvre and Plaza accords are examples. Today, policy coordination has resurfaced as a hot topic: while the worst of the global financial crisis is behind us, no one would claim that a return to 'Great Moderation'\u009d is in the cards, and policymakers around the globe appear worried about policy transmissions across many dimensions. Views on the size of cross-border policy spillovers have evolved over time, but today no one doubts that we live in an interconnected world. In the 1980s, the literature often concluded that these cross-border effects were small, but more recent evidence suggests that spillovers are sizable, reflecting the increase in trade and financial integration. And spillovers are generally larger in turbulent times. The externalities associated with cross-border spillovers also reflect a paucity of policy instruments relative to targets'which means that it is difficult, not to say impossible, for a country to inoculate itself against the cross-border policy transmission. If the number of instruments equals the number of targets, cooperative and non-cooperative outcomes will be the same, and there will be no gains from international coordination. The legacy of the global financial crisis'high public debt, near zero interest rates, and at times what looks like domestic political dysfunction'suggests that nowadays policymakers have fewer policy tools to achieve their manifold objectives. In such circumstances, gains from policy coordination across countries are likely to be larger than during the Great Moderation. Coordination is seen, occasionally. The global fiscal stimulus enacted in the early days of the financial crisis is a case in point. The fiscal expansion, exerting a positive cross-border spillover (and thus an insufficient stimulus in the non-cooperative equilibrium), is generally seen to have raised global welfare. There may have been other factors at work at the time as well: the stigma of rising public debt may be less when everyone is engaging in expansion than when only some countries are doing so. Other examples of coordinated policies during the crisis include the pursuit of tax havens and the commitment to eschew protectionism and competitive depreciation to support aggregate demand. But there may be cases where countries don't pursue the potential gains from coordination. A case in point is unconventional monetary policies. The major currency areas (the U.S. Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan) did not coordinate their monetary expansions, which reflected domestic objectives. Yet spillovers from such policies are likely to have been large, through both trade and financial flows. What might account for the international community's failure to pursue the potential gains from coordination? In related work, [Ostry and Ghosh emphasize the role of uncertainty and disagreement on the size and even the sign (that is, positive or negative) of cross-border policy effects. Take the simplest case of a monetary expansion, which raises demand for exports in the rest of the world (positive spillover) but appreciates the currencies of other countries (negative spillover). Source and recipient countries may have quite different views on the size, or even the sign, of the net spillover (output plus exchange rate effect), as the debates surrounding 'currency wars'\u009d showed. These debates are nothing new, but uncertainties may be larger now: the policy instruments are unconventional and their effects less certain. Uncertainty makes it harder to negotiate and sustain a coordinated outcome. Country A may claim its policies help the rest of the world, while country B may claim harm. As a negotiating tactic this may be sensible, but it is hardly a recipe for arriving to the cooperative outcome. The paper by Ostry and Ghosh also discusses other impediments to realizing the gains from coordination, including a lack of focus on domestic policy tradeoffs (such tradeoffs are indeed a necessary condition for successful coordination) and inherent asymmetries in the global economy. What can we learn both from the successful coordination cases and the less successful ones? First, there have to be large and clear gaps between cooperating and not cooperating to overcome the tendency of countries to solve their problems unilaterally. And it must also be clear how each player can contribute to the global outcome. When coordination implies that all players have to do the same thing (say, expand fiscal policy, or refrain from competitive depreciations), coordination is likely to be easier to explain and to achieve. When the quid pro quo is more complex, coordination is likely to be more difficult and may just not happen'even if on paper the gains are large. Can something better be done? There would seem to be a role for a 'neutral assessor' to clarify the nature of spillover effects and thus make it easier to establish and sustain cooperative outcomes. The IMF already plays a role as an assessor through its country surveillance and, by recognizing the increased interconnectedness across countries, it is playing a greater role in identifying spillovers. Here it can help identify policies that would be in both the national and global interest. Is there more that could be done? There may be times when the scope for mutually advantageous policies simply is not there: for example, when a large country's policies exert adverse spillovers across a swath of smaller countries but the actions of the smaller players do not materially affect economic outcomes in the large country. Would some guideposts or rules of the road (analogous to the rules that originally underpinned Bretton Woods'e.g., against competitive depreciation) help to limit the scope for adverse spillovers be desirable in such cases? The logic of such rules seems compelling. The guideposts could take the form of warnings, or stronger measures, when current accounts deviate too much from current account norms, or when some aspects of a country's capital account become too unbalanced, contributing to credit or asset price boom-bust cycles abroad. Our sense is that, like the Loch Ness monster, international macro policy coordination may continue to be heard about more often than it is seen. There are important obstacles to reaping the gains from coordination. To help overcome those, the circumstances when gains are likely to be large need to be identified and a push made for specific coordinated outcomes in such cases. And when the gains from coordination are not there, this needs to be acknowledged. But even in such cases, if large players in the global economy are responsible for significant adverse spillovers across a swath of smaller countries, this needs to be acknowledged as well, and feasible remedies considered.

Since 2009, countries have generally increased public deficits, drawing down on their fiscal coffers. These expansionary policies continue and are yet to be reversed. With further pressures likely to build over the period ahead'as economic growth has slowed, commodity prices have softened, and external funding costs are bound to rise'now is the right time to rethink fiscal policies across the region. **Significant progress** [Latin America's public finances have strengthened in many ways over the past ten years. * Government debt ratios declined by 16\u00c2? percentage points on average between 2002 and 2012, reflecting rapid GDP growth, falling interest costs, and solid primary surpluses in the first half of the period. * The average maturity of debt outstanding has increased, reducing rollover and interest rate risks. * Countries have further overcome the so-called 'original sin', which described a strong historical dependence on external funding in foreign currency. In all of the financially integrated economies, debt issuance has shifted decisively toward local-currency bonds, lowering exchange rate risk. Better fiscal outcomes have been supported by stronger institutions, as several countries'including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru'have introduced or strengthened their fiscal responsibility frameworks since 2000. **But more challenging times ahead** [Yet, governments have also been helped by exceptionally favorable external conditions. Commodity exporters benefited from a sustained surge in global commodity prices, which boosted export earnings, domestic growth, and government revenues. From 2002 to 2008, fiscal revenue in the region grew from below 26 percent to above 30 percent of GDP. In addition, the marked fall in global interest rates reduced average government interest bills by almost 2 percentage points of GDP over the course of the decade. The increase in revenue and decline in interest expenses improved fiscal balances, even as primary government spending soared. The greater fiscal space also allowed policymakers to mount a strong countercylical response to the global financial crisis, for the first time in the history of Latin America. [However, these expansionary policies have proven hard to reverse, with public expenditure significantly outpacing revenue since 2008. Looking at the entire period from 2002'12, primary expenditure has climbed from 24\u00c2? percent to 30 percent of GDP on average across Latin America. Increases were particularly large in Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela, where the ratio of primary spending to GDP surged by 12-23 percentage points. As a result, fiscal balances are now significantly weaker than prior to the global financial crisis in most countries. **No case for fresh stimulus today ** With economic activity slowing and external tailwinds turning into headwinds, how should fiscal policy respond? From a cyclical perspective, even though growth is moderating, output levels are still close to potential. Tight labor markets, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the continued widening of current account deficits all point to limited spare capacity. Therefore, it is hard to argue that more fiscal easing is needed. Indeed, as the previous stimulus has never been properly reversed, launching a new stimulus now would undermine its credibility as a countercyclical tool. And even if activity were to ease a bit further, monetary policy is better suited to respond to a normal cyclical slowdown. Crucially, some of the ongoing growth slowdown may be structural in nature. Research done at the IMF suggests that potential growth rates in the region are coming down (see Chapter 3 of the [May 2013 REO). Growth of physical capital is expected to moderate, reflecting the expected normalization of external financing conditions and the stabilization of commodity prices. Employment growth is also likely to be limited going forward'labor participation rates are already elevated, and unemployment has fallen to record lows. Thus, unless total factor productivity growth picks up, output growth is likely to stay below the rates observed over the past decade. In this environment, attempts to maintain unrealistically high growth targets through fiscal stimulus would merely weaken public finances. Conversely, maintaining strong fiscal balances will put governments in a better position to buffer the impact of future headwinds, such as rising real interest rates and a possible decline in global commodity prices. It will also help address current imbalances, including widening external current account deficits and persistently high inflation in some countries. Taking a longer perspective, prudent fiscal policy today will provide a strong foundation to meet the future challenge of population aging. After a long period of continous increases in public spending, now may also be a good time to launch a thorough expenditure review that looks for ways to increase efficiency and reduce wasteful or untargeted expenditure. Overall, prudent policy choices today are critical to preserve the gains in fiscal stability that have been achieved over the past decade, and to lay the basis for continued prosperity.

Still, better late than never! I was delighted to be back in Seoul, capital of one of the world's most dynamic and innovative economies. Just remember: in a remarkably short period of time, Korea has risen from close to the bottom to close to the top'becoming the thirteenth most prosperous economy with an income per capita that is higher than the European Union average. With such a track record, Korea plays an increasingly important role on the global stage. It held the annual presidency of the Group of Twenty advanced and emerging economies at the height of the global financial crisis in 2010. It is host to the Green Climate Fund, whose aim is to help developing countries respond to climate change'surely one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. And it is playing ever increasing leadership roles in other international institutions, including the IMF. Korea's enhanced role in global affairs is paralleled by the reach of its 'soft power'\u009d: the famous 'hallyu'\u009d (Korean wave) has swept Asia and beyond with the melodies of its K-pop stars, its addictive Korean dramas and the technological wizardry of its products.

I learned a lot from my discussions'with the authorities, with women leaders, and with students at the extremely prestigious Seoul National University, where I had been invited for [a lecture and dialogue with students.If I could distil the main takeaway from my interactions, it would be this: for Korea to stay at the cutting edge of the global economy, it needs to sustain the inclusive growth that has been the hallmark of its development, and give everybody the chance to develop their multiple talents and fulfill their rich potential. In part, this means providing more opportunities for young people and women'who tend to be less included in the labor market than is the case in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. I was really struck by the worries of young people about growing inequality and discontent in society'especially related to their fears about finding meaningful work, job security, and a living wage in an ever more competitive world.

First among these, of course, is President Park Geun-hye, the first woman elected to the highest office in Korea, whose life has been dedicated to the service of her country. With women of this caliber, it is hard not to be optimistic about Korea's future'but they must all be given a chance to access and demonstrate their many talents. Letting everybody contribute also means strengthening the social safety net, and Korea can afford it. And it means making the services sector embrace more fully the dynamism that is the true hallmark of Korea, including by tackling vested interests where needed. I take great encouragement from the government's commitment to push ahead in all of these areas. For my part, I emphasized the importance of an enduring partnership between Korea and the IMF. Korea has and will always have an important place at the IMF'exemplified most recently through our newly-appointed Korean director of the Asia and Pacific Department! I further saw Korea's contribution in action with its generous commitment to provide $15 million over five years toward the IMF's capacity building programs'a strong display of global solidarity that will give other countries the chance to follow in Korea's footsteps. In turn, the IMF wants to be of service to Korea, through our critical role in international economic cooperation and our multilateral perspective. We bring together the viewpoints of our global membership. And we have a unique cross- country perspective on how the different parts of the global economy fit together, affect each other, and ultimately can cooperate together for the global economic good. In short, I left Korea feeling energized and optimistic. I also left looking forward to further partnership with Korea as it continues its dynamic quest to forge the best possible future for its people.

In addition to capacity building, an example that quite a few people raised with me involves rice field irrigation! Not exactly something usually associated with the IMF. But Cambodia used the resources freed up by IMF debt relief to invest in an irrigation scheme that completely transformed the country's rice production, turning it from a net importer to a net exporter of rice. For me, this was a perfect example of partnership in action, of the multi-layered benefits that can result when we work with a member country like Cambodia that has full ownership of its economic program.

It's the season for shopping. We have Cyber Monday in the United States and Singles Day in China (November 11 or 11/11). So, while we are pondering shopping, try to guess which consumer market is growing the fastest. The answer is'\u00a6China! China had the largest consumption increase in the world. This was true in 2011, true in 2012, and likely to be true again this year (see chart). Consumption in China is also generally thought to be weak. Indeed, the government and the IMF are calling for more consumer-based growth. How could consumption, in effect, be both weak and strong at the same time? **Consumption is not weak'\u00a6** [The chart shows the US$ increase of consumption in China and other large economies. China has been tops for the past few years (see the bars). It has also had the fastest real growth in consumption (see the dots). The US$ increase (bars) is a combination of the pace of consumption growth, size of the economy, and exchange rate. For China, exchange rate appreciation also contributes to the large measured increase in US$, as well as the negative bar for Japan this year. So whether measured in US$ terms or real growth, among major economies, China's consumer market is the fastest growing in the world. It is also true that consumption as a share of GDP has been declining. It has fallen by some 10 percent of GDP over the past 10 years or so. However, a big reason for the decline is that GDP has been growing fast, even faster than consumption. This is just arithmetic. In real terms, however, consumption has grown about 9 percent a year for the past decade'a fantastic outcome! This just happens to be less than the 10 percent average growth in GDP. Two factors are behind the declining share of consumption. First, household saving has been rising. The reasons are complex, and perhaps not fully understood, but pre-cautionary motives are a popular explanation. Households are uncertain about how much health, education, and pension the government will provide, so self-insure by increasing saving. Second, household income has been growing slower than GDP. Same story as above: Household income has been growing fast, but just not as fast as GDP. These factors are each discussed further in '[Sino- Spending'\u009d. **Moving to consumer-based growth** Rebalancing toward more consumer-based growth means, in short, boosting the consumption to GDP ratio. Consumer-based growth, however, is a foreign concept to macroeconomists. We tend to look at growth from the supply-side of the economy: Capital (factories) and labor (workers) are combined with technology (total factor productivity) to produce output (GDP). The consumer-based growth story, however, can also be told from the supply-side of the economy. Expanding the service sector is a critical step for achieving more consumer- based growth. The service sector, while growing, is smaller in China in terms of output and employment than comparator economies. As the service sector takes a larger and larger share of the economy, household income (and thus consumption) will naturally rise as a share of GDP. Moreover, advances in the service sector could also lower the price for many consumer services and thereby increase sales (e.g., consumption) see [IMF Working Paper. Other reforms will also help. Strengthening the financial sector will help finance the expansion of the service sector, a part of the economy that currently has difficulty accessing credit. It will also boost household income directly, as new financial products boost investment income. Social security reform, meanwhile, could help reduce pre-cautionary saving. Moreover, payroll taxes are very high and regressive (employee plus employer social contributions often exceed 40 percent of wages). Reducing the contribution rates will help boost labor income directly through lower taxes and indirectly by boosting employment. These are just some examples. In fact, many other reforms announced at the recent Third Plenum will also help lift the consumption ratio. Higher resource taxation, labor market reforms, and land reform could all help boost household income and lower household saving'either directly or indirectly by shifting the economy more toward services. As reforms take hold, the end result should be a rise in the consumption to GDP ratio. It happens as a welcome by-product of moving to a more balanced and sustainable growth path, which also leads to a larger service sector, lower household saving rates, and a higher labor share of income. It also means a more inclusive (improved labor market) and environment-friendly (services are less polluting than industry) growth path. And, since consumption will be growing faster than GDP, it will also be more consumer-based growth.

A key pillar of its hard-won economic success has been sound economic policies and the adoption of far-reaching social programs, which resulted in a substantial decline in poverty. In the last couple of years Brazil's growth slowed down. Although other emerging market economies experienced a similar slowdown, the growth outturns in Brazil were particularly disappointing. And the measures taken to stimulate the economy did not produce a sustained recovery. This is because unleashing sustained growth in Brazil requires measures geared not at stimulating domestic demand but at changing the composition of demand towards investment and at increasing productivity. **Home-grown woes** [Inadequate infrastructure and imbalances in demand are hampering Brazil's growth process. During 2011-13 private consumption in Brazil has been strongly supported by very low unemployment, broad gains in real wages (partly owing to large increases in minimum wages), and buoyant credit expansion. But investment has been disappointingly weak. Global uncertainties played a role, especially in 2011, but the main factors behind the sluggish investment have been home-grown, including the steady loss of competitiveness. **Restarting growth** To address this situation, the recent [report on Brazil's economy prepared by IMF staff recommends solidifying Brazil's macroeconomic policy framework and adopting measures and reforms geared at increasing the economy's productive potential and improving competitiveness. The tightening of monetary conditions initiated by Brazil's central bank in April is a step in the right direction that has helped lower inflation expectations and contain inertia. Sustained fiscal consolidation, through adherence to a fiscal primary surplus of about 3 percent of GDP, would also be important as it would keep domestic demand in check, lower public indebtedness, and bolster a recovery in confidence and investment. The government's renewed focus on policies to alleviate constraints on the economy's productive capacity, in particular infrastructure concessions to the private sector, is also welcome. **The near-term outlook** Staff projects that Brazil will grow by about 2\u00c2? percent this year and next. Although higher than the growth rate of 2012, this performance will keep Brazil below its potential growth. **** Moreover, the outlook is subject to many risks. The recovery could prove more unbalanced'that is, excessively dependent on consumption'and sluggish than envisaged. The factors underlying weak investment and supply constraints may be more severe than anticipated. Or investor confidence may not be restored. If those risks materialize, the response should not be further demand stimulus. This response would exacerbate domestic demand imbalances, widen the external current account deficit, reignite inflationary pressures and weaken confidence. There are also external risks to the outlook stemming from Brazil's reliance on foreign savings, and its highly integrated financial markets. However, the flexible exchange rate, strong monetary policy framework and large holdings of international reserves would provide protection against those risks. **Reaching full potential** Brazil can do better. To get the Brazilian economy close to [potential growth'currently estimated at about 3\u00c2? percent'the government should focus on enhancing productivity and stepping up investment, including in infrastructure. As noted, the government's renewed focus on policies to alleviate constraints on the economy's productive capacity is welcome. These efforts should be complemented with an overhaul of the minimum wage indexation mechanism and reforms to keep labor costs in check and prevent further erosion in competitiveness. Lowering and simplifying taxes and improving business conditions to lower what has become known as the _custo Brasil_ should also be part of the agenda.

Here is my take. I shall focus on what I see as the lessons for monetary policy, but before I do this, let me mention two other important conclusions. One, having your macro house in order pays off when there is an (external) crisis. In contrast to previous episodes, wise fiscal policy before this crisis gave [emerging market countries the room to pursue [countercyclical fiscal policies during the crisis, and this made a substantial difference. Second, after a financial crisis, it is essential to rapidly clean up and recapitalize the banks. This did not happen in [Japan in the 1990s, and was costly. But it did happen in the US in this crisis, and it helped the recovery. Now let me now turn to monetary policy, and touch on three issues: the implications of the liquidity trap, the provision of liquidity, and the management of capital flows. On the liquidity trap: we have discovered, unfortunately at great cost, that the zero lower bound can indeed be binding, and be binding for a long time'five years at this point. We have also discovered that, even then, there is still some room for monetary policy. The bulk of the [evidence is that unconventional policy can systematically affect the term premia, and thus bend the yield curve through portfolio effects. But it remains a fact that compared to conventional policy, the effects of unconventional monetary policy are very limited and uncertain. There is therefore much to be said for avoiding the trap in the first place in the future, and this raises again the question of the [inflation rate. There is wide agreement that in most advanced countries, it would be good if inflation was higher today. Presumably, if it had been higher pre-crisis, it would be higher today. To be more concrete, if inflation had been 2 percentage points higher before the crisis, the best guess is that it would be 2 percentage points higher today, the real rate would be 2 percentage points lower, and we would probably be close in the United States to an exit from zero nominal rates today. We should not dismiss the possibility, raised by [Larry Summers that we may need negative real rates for a long time. Countries could in principle achieve negative real rates through low nominal rates and moderate inflation. Instead, we are still facing today the danger of an adverse feedback loop, in which depressed demand leads to lower inflation, lower inflation leads to higher real rates, and higher real rates lead in turn to even more depressed demand. Turning to liquidity provision: in advanced countries (but, again, the lesson is more general), we have learned that runs are relevant not only for banks, but also for other financial institutions, and for governments. In an environment of high public debt, rollover risks cannot be excluded. An implication, and one of the themes emphasized by [Paul Krugman, is that it is essential to have a lender of last resort, ready to lend not only to financial institutions but also to governments. The evidence on periphery sovereign bonds in the Euro area, pre and post the European Central Bank's announcement of outright monetary transactions, is quite convincing on this point. Finally, turning to capital flows. In emerging markets (and, more generally, in small advanced economies, although these were not explicitly covered at the conference), the evidence suggests the best way to deal with volatile capital flows is by letting the exchange rate absorb most'but not necessarily all'of the adjustment. The standard argument in favor of letting the exchange rate adjust was stated by Paul Krugman at the conference. If investors want to take their funds out, let them: the exchange rate will depreciate, and this will lead, if anything, to an increase in exports and an increase in output. Three arguments have traditionally been given, however, against relying on exchange rate adjustment. The first is that, to the extent that domestic borrowers have borrowed in foreign currency, the depreciation has adverse effects on balance sheets, and leads to a decrease in domestic demand that may more than offset the increase in exports. The second is that much of the nominal depreciation may simply translate into higher inflation. The third is that large movements in the exchange rate may lead to disruptions, both in the real economy and in financial markets. The evidence, however, is that the first two are much less relevant than they were in previous crises. Thanks to macroprudential measures, to the development of local currency bond markets, and to exchange rate flexibility and thus a better perception by borrowers of exchange rate risk, foreign exchange exposure in emerging market countries is much more limited than it was in previous crises. And thanks to increased credibility of monetary policy and inflation targets, inflation expectations appear much better anchored, leading to limited effects of exchange rate movements on inflation. However the third argument remains relevant. And this is why central banks in emerging market countries have not moved to full float, but to '[managed float,'\u009d that is the joint use of the policy rate, foreign exchange intervention, macroprudential measures, and capital controls. This has allowed them to reduce the old dilemma that arises when the only instrument used is the policy rate: an increase in the policy rate may avoid the overheating associated with capital inflows, but at the same time, it may make it even more attractive for foreign investors to come in. Foreign exchange intervention, capital controls, and macro prudential tools can, at least in principle, limit movements in [exchange rates, and disruptions in the financial system without recourse to the policy rate. Countries have used all of these tools in this crisis. Some have relied more on capital controls, some more on foreign exchange intervention. And the [evidence, both from the conference, but also from work at the IMF, suggests that these tools have worked, if not perfectly. Looking forward, the clear (and quite formidable) challenge is to understand how best to combine them. In short, monetary policy will never be the same after the crisis. The conference helped us understand how it had moved, and where we have to focus our research and policy efforts in the future.

It was a whirlwind visit, with many places to see and people to meet, in a thriving corner of the global economy. Kuwait has extended to me its emblematic tradition of hospitality' a testament to its ancient and noble culture. I was awed by the magnificent artifacts of the al-Sabah collection, which I saw in the beautifully restored Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah cultural center. Back to economics. The member countries of the council'Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates'have some of world's highest living standards. The region has also become a major destination for foreign workers and a source of remittances for their families back home. And it is a financial center and a hub for international trade and business services. Nevertheless, there are challenges: the GCC countries need to find new sources of productivity and prosperity for the 21st century. As I can attest from my meetings with policymakers, students and women, this is a live issue in Kuwait. They all agreed that the region need to build on its gains, and it needs to start now. What does this mean? It means saving for future generations, diversifying the economies and creating jobs in the private sector for citizens. It means investing in skills and education, so that all, boys and girls, men and women'can fulfill their potential and live rewarding lives. **Saving for future generations** Most GCC countries could do more to save their oil revenues for future generations. Some have started to cut back on public spending this year. Going forward, policies should focus on further containing _current_ spending'while minimizing the impact on growth and enhancing social equity. This means that governments will need to find ways to rein in hard-to-reverse expenditures (wages and subsidies) and target spending on high-quality capital investments and social programs. **Investing in education** As a daughter of two professors, I am a firm believer in the amazing power of education. The Arab world was an early pioneer in the field of scientific enquiry, going all the way back to people like Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Haytham and Jabir Ibn Hayyan. This is the region's legacy and it could also be its destiny. Certainly, there have been great strides in the region. The number of years students spend in school has risen considerably over the past decade. But there is still some distance to travel if citizens are to compete for jobs with the best and the brightest in the global economy. Math and science scores are relatively poor, and the skills acquired do not match the requirements in the private sector.** ** **Taking the plunge** Why bother? Well, productivity'the key driver of long-term growth'has declined or stagnated. A key reason is the tendency for graduates to seek safety in the harbor of the public sector, instead of sailing into the open waters of private employment. Over the first decade of this century, Gulf countries created about 5\u00c2? million private sector jobs. Nearly nine in ten of these jobs went to expatriates. This does not bode well for the future. If current trends continue, only a third to a half of citizens joining the labor force by 2018 would find private sector jobs. But we all know that the dynamic economy of tomorrow will not be driven by a bloated public sector. Governments can make private employment more attractive both by resisting the urge to open the floodgates of public employment in times of stress, and by taking measures to boost private sector pay'including by facilitating on-the- job training and offering dual-education systems, which combine apprenticeships with formal vocational schooling. Well-targeted wage subsidies may also help, at least temporarily. As I told students at Kuwait University, graduates need to do their part, too. They should be prepared to take the plunge and seek employment in the private sector. I know it is not easy'I did it as a young lawyer myself'but it will pay off, personally and for the country. **Women and economic growth** Women play a key role in the region's future. Here, Kuwait is a role model: womens' labor force participation is the highest in the Gulf region. Kuwait is home to some of the brightest, most educated, most creative women in the world. I had the pleasure of meeting some of them during my visit. With talent of this caliber, I know the future of the region is in good hands. Letting women participate more fully in economic life can yield enormous economic benefits'as shown in a recent [IMF study. This is one area where the region as a whole lags behind. For the entire Middle East and North Africa region, the gap between men and women's participation in the labor force over the past decade was almost _triple _the average gap in the emerging market and developing economies. If this gap had simply been _double _instead of triple, the gains for the entire region, the Gulf countries included, would have been enormous'almost $1 trillion in output, amounting to annual gains of about 6 percent of GDP. Given the stakes, it is not only time, but worth it to break down the obstacles that hold women back. This can be done by making sure that all girls have access to quality education, removing restrictions on the economic role of women'their mobility, their participation in certain sectors, their property rights\u00c2\u00ad'and enshrining the principle of equal pay for equal work. Giving mothers and fathers real choices through appropriate parental leave programs and quality child care would also help.** ** The Gulf region and the Arab world at large have enormous potential, building from a great legacy. To build bridges to the future, the region needs to save more, diversify its economies more, and invest more in its young, dynamic, and highly-motivated population. The IMF is ready to stand with the region while building those bridges.

When you woke up this morning, you found only $30'and a note from the government saying, 'Thank you very much, we took $10 as a tax payment.'\u009d This is, of course, extremely irritating. To an economist, however, it's close to an ideal form of taxation, since there is nothing you can now do to reduce, avoid, or evade it'the holy grail of what economists call a non-distorting tax. (This doesn't mean that you won't react in some way. Being worse off, you may now work a bit more, or save a bit less. But any other tax raising $1 would make you even worse off, because it would change relative prices (a tax on your earnings would make working less attractive, for instance), and so take your choices even further from those you would make in the absence of taxation.) What was just described is the essential idea of a 'capital levy,'\u009d the passing discussion of which in [Box 6 of the recent[ _Fiscal Monitor__ _attracted much attention. (To be clear, there is no such proposal from the IMF; the box simply contains an analytical description of the issue and experiences, which had already been the subject of some public discussion). Such a levy would entail a one-off charge on capital assets, the precise base being a matter for choice, but generally larger than cash left on kitchen tables. Added to the efficiency advantage of such a tax, many see an equity appeal in that such a charge would naturally fall most heavily on those with the most assets. So it is not surprising that the idea of a capital levy has at times risen high in public debate, especially after wars in which extraordinary means are sought to reduce high levels of debt'whether of the winners (Britain after the Napoleonic and First World Wars, for instance) or losers (Germany after the First World War, Japan after the Second World War). But, as the [review by Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen makes clear, governments have rarely implemented capital levies, and they have almost never succeeded. And there are very good reasons for that. **Or poisoned chalice?** The homey analogy also points to a pretty fundamental flaw in this basic case for a capital levy. Tonight, fearing that the government will do the same again, you may choose not to leave your cash on the table, or perhaps you will spend it. Looking closer at the note that the government left on the table, you find 'P.S. We promise not to do this again.'\u009d But do you believe it? What if the government finds itself in trouble again? Now you are likely to search for ways to reduce, avoid or evade possible future levies'and the tax may become highly distortionary. The point is that to be non-distorting the tax must be both unanticipated and believed certain not to be repeated. These are both very hard things to achieve. Introducing and implementing any new tax takes time, and governments can rarely do it in entire secrecy (even leaving aside transparency issues). And that gives time for assets to be moved abroad, run down, or concealed. The risk of future levies can be even more damaging; they discourage the saving and investment that generate future capital assets. More generally still, the credibility of all government tax policy can be jeopardized by unanticipated taxes of this sort. If the government can do this, what's to stop them from, say, suddenly deciding that the depreciation of past investments and interest incurred on old loans will no longer be deductible against tax? Effective taxation requires a degree of confidence in future tax policies that goes beyond any legal restrictions governments may face on their ability to tax. So the point is not simply that in practice, any capital levy will be distorting: it is that it is likely to be very distorting. The experience of capital levies bears out these warnings. Where they have been tried, they have rarely raised much revenue, being preceded by lengthy public debate and capital flight (associated with an inflation that eroded the underlying debt problem). Eichengreen finds only one successful example: Japan after the Second World War, where the tax was imposed by an occupying power and so was largely unconstrained by democratic norms and did not taint for future governments. This was the exception'emphatically not the rule. **A wealth of wealth taxes**** ** A capital levy is one form of wealth tax. It should not be confused, as it sometimes has been, with the many other possible types of tax on wealth and its transfer: taxes on estates left at death, on inheritance and gifts, on real estate, on transactions in capital assets, to name but a few. The economics of these are quite different and, in some cases, much more attractive. We also discussed this in the [_Fiscal Monitor_, and it deserves a blog of its own. ** ** ", "index": 395}, {"pub": "11/1/2013", "title": "The IMF Annual Research Conference:  Economics of Crises\u00e2\u20ac\u0095Past Experiences and Present Travails", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6609", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard Several years out from the global financial crisis, the world economy is still confronting its painful legacies. Many countries are suffering from lackluster recoveries coupled with high and persistent unemployment. Policymakers are tackling the costs stemming from the crisis, managing the transition from crisis-era policies, and trying to adapt to the associated cross-border spillovers. Against this background, the IMF's 14th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, entitled [_'Crises: Yesterday and Today,'\u009d_ to take place on November 7-8, will take stock of our understanding of past and present crises. This year's conference will be a special one as we shall honor [Stanley Fischer's many contributions to economic research and policy. Stan has extensively studied economic and financial crises, first as a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then as a policymaker with many hats over the years'the Chief Economist of the World Bank, the First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, and the Governor of the Bank of Israel. Stan is not just a crisis expert, but also an old friend to many of us. The conference will bring together an outstanding array of economists and policymakers, many of whom studied, or worked in collaboration with him. His insights and influence are strongly felt throughout the conference program. **_Can a Confidence Crisis Happen Here? _** Paul Krugman, recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics and a student of Stan, will deliver the keynote Mundell-Fleming lecture, titled [_'Currency Regimes, Capital Flows, and Crises.'\u009d__ _ Paul plans to tackle the challenging issue of whether crises of confidence such as those that afflicted the Euro area periphery can similarly erupt in other countries, including the United States. Using a combination of theory and case study analysis, he reaches a thought-provoking conclusion: it is _not_ possible to have such crises of confidence in countries that retain their own currencies, borrow in those currencies, and let their exchange rates float. **__****_Many Faces of Crises: Differences, Similarities, and Policies_** Thirteen other papers at the conference will run the gamut of the lessons that we can draw from past crises, and issues to consider arising from the unique policies implemented since 2008. A flavor of the questions we will be discussing include: * [How can Japan's experience during its 'lost decade'\u009d inform us about the prospects and appropriate policies for Europe and the United States today? * Why were [Latin America and [East Asia more resilient to the most recent crisis than to past episodes of global turbulence? * [What can we say about the empirical effects of policies, such as depreciations, changes in interest rates, reserve sales, and capital controls during crises? * [How has fiscal policy behaved differently between the latest crisis and past episodes? [And what are the implications of these differences for economic growth? * [Does it matter who sets goals of central banks for inflation outcomes? * [If large demand shocks have persistent effects on aggregate supply, how should monetary policy respond to them? * [What are the costs and benefits of having a higher inflation target or a nominal income target? * [What are the implications of different exchange rate arrangements for macroeconomic and financial stability? **_Deriving Policy Lessons While Honoring Fischer _** In addition to the _Mundell-Fleming_ lecture, the conference will feature four other special events. David Lipton, First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, will deliver the opening speech of the conference. The first day of the conference will also feature a luncheon speech by Mohamed El-Erian who will speculate on what Stan Fischer, his one-time boss at the IMF some 20 years ago, would place on the institutional research agenda today. As one would expect from Mohamed, he will also link his discussion to the prospects for the global economy and markets. On the second day, Ratna Sahay and Karnit Flug, who worked closely with Stan at different institutions, will provide luncheon remarks to honor his contributions to policymaking at the IMF and the Bank of Israel. Finally, we will conclude the conference with an [Economic Forum on 'Policy Responses to Crises.'\u009d I shall chair a panel that will include Stan Fischer himself as well as Ben Bernanke, Ken Rogoff, and Larry Summers. They will talk about the main policy lessons we have learned from past crises, and will discuss whether we are ready to handle the next potential crisis. The IMF's Annual Research Conference convenes top academics and policymakers to help stimulate an informed debate and help develop new approaches to economic policy. As usual, many of the conference papers will be featured in the[ _IMF Economic Review__ _, which has quickly become one of the leading peer-reviewed journals in open-economy macroeconomics.

Sayeh When meeting with people outside Africa, I'm often asked whether Africa's growth takeoff since the mid-1990s has been simply a 'commodity story'\u009d'a ride fueled by windfall gains from high commodity prices. But finance ministers and other policymakers in the region, and I was one of them, know that the story is richer than that. In this spirit, in our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa_ a team of economists from the IMF's African Department show that Africa's continued success is more than a commodity story. In fact, quite a few economies in the region have become high performers without basing their success on natural resources'thanks in no small part to sound policymaking. In reaching their conclusions, my colleagues looked closely at six countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) over the 1995'2010 period. All of these countries laid the foundation for sustained growth by turning around their macroeconomic situation, often after a period of destructive conflict. In particular, I was impressed that all these countries had encompassing visions and strategic frameworks that made their turnaround possible. * **_Burkina Faso_** worked hard on its institutions and focused early on medium-term macroeconomic planning. It also skillfully managed the cotton sector, which is important for the country and provides a living for a large number of poor people. * **_Ethiopia_**, by far the most populous country in the sample, accelerated growth by actively supporting agriculture and certain export products and services (cut flowers, tourism, and air travel). * **_Mozambique_** attracted significant foreign investment and other external capital flows in the late 1990s, which funded capital-intensive megaprojects to produce and transmit electricity and gas, with the former used to produce aluminum. * **_Rwanda_** experienced a rebound effect after achieving political stability, underpinned by a national recovery strategy that successfully focused on specific sectors, such as tourism and coffee. * **_Tanzania_** achieved sustained high growth by three well sequenced waves of macroeconomic and structural reforms, which reached across all sectors. * **_Uganda_** started to carry out significant macroeconomic and structural reforms just before 1990, stimulated private investment, and launched a policy to diversify its export base to include nontraditional products. The main takeaway from the country cases is what my colleagues called a _virtuous circle_'all six countries carried out sensible and medium term'oriented policymaking and important structural reforms, which in turn attracted higher aid flows and made it possible for these countries to receive debt relief, releasing their own resources. These gains translated into 'fiscal space'\u009d to expand social spending and capital investment, in particular infrastructure, which in turn contributed to higher growth. **Importance of agriculture** When we look at the structure of these six economies, we immediately see that agriculture is still of enormous importance in most countries, employing about 80 percent of the active labor force in Mozambique and Burkina Faso, 71 percent in Uganda, and 65 percent in Tanzania. We also know that the poor are concentrated in rural areas, and most of the extremely poor rely on subsistence farming for their livelihoods. All countries still have significant potential to increase their agricultural output going forward, which will be important to achieve more inclusive growth'growth that is shared more equally across all segments of the populations, including the poorest. Ethiopia and Rwanda have already shown that government programs to provide more access to seeds and fertilizers can improve agricultural yields dramatically. Services were also an important driver of growth in our six sample countries, reflecting to some extent the expansion of the telecommunications sector. Mobile phones have now become an important tool for communication across African populations'and they also provide important information such as market prices for crops. Of course, they can also be used for mobile banking in some countries, including in remote areas where land lines are not available. I am excited about this financial inclusion through mobile phones of very poor people'people that remain outside the formal financial system. **Room in the budget** I would also like to point out that our six countries have created and used their fiscal space wisely. Fiscal space is room in the budget for productive investment and other priority expenditure. The six countries benefited early from debt relief, and also received relatively large external flows, both in the form of budgetary aid and foreign direct investment'again a testimony to their advanced policymaking and strategic vision. And I can say that these resources fell into a productive environment. Investment rates for the sample countries were higher than for their peers, and they invested in infrastructure and in the health and education sectors. Mozambique even experimented with public-private partnerships to develop its infrastructure, in particular for railway lines, ports, and toll roads. Looking ahead, tough challenges remain, but I am also reassured by big opportunities. Despite massive investment, infrastructure in the sample countries still has a long way to go to meet the population's basic needs. Businesses are also hard to run if there are continuous power cuts and electricity shortages. Farmers cannot market their products properly, as there are no roads to connect them with urban centers. Therefore, sustained and high investment in infrastructure, particular in the energy and transportation sector, remains crucial Overall, though, the six countries my colleagues have have studied'Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda'have transformed themselves into high performers, even without being natural resource producers, and I believe that, with the right policies, they are on the trajectory to becoming emerging markets.

Less growth in China today will mean higher income in the future. So rather than worry, we should welcome the slowdown in China's economy. Why? Because by favoring structural reforms over short-term stimulus, China's leadership is illustrating their commitment to move to a more balanced and sustainable growth model. **Current model is not sustainable** Borrow and spend, or in China's case, borrow and invest works great to prop up growth. At least for a while. But eventually, debt rises, investment becomes less productive, and the risks rise. Fortunately, China's economy still has considerable buffers. The risks to the outlook in the near-term, therefore, is extremely low. But the economy is becoming more vulnerable on several fronts: surging credit, strains on local government finances, and weakening balance sheets in parts of the corporate sector. Credit provides the clearest example. A broad measure of credit (total social financing) had held steady at about 130 percent of GDP for much of the 2000s. However, since 2008, it has shot up to around 200 percent of GDP;an increase of 70 percent of GDP in 4\u00c2? years. Not surprising, therefore, that investment is also booming. Investment accounts for nearly half of the economy's output, which is among the highest in the world. Indeed, it is also high relative to the historical experience of other fast growing economies. As more output goes into investment, less goes into consumption. Indeed, in the past decade consumption's share of output has declined significantly. Reversing this trend requires rebalancing growth away from investment and towards consumption. **More balanced and sustainable growth** Achieving more balanced and sustainable growth will hinge on implementation of a package of reforms. Let's focus on two areas of the package: further strengthening of the financial sector and opening the service sector to more competition. Done together, these reforms could provide another one-two punch analogous to state enterprise reform in the late 1990s and joining the World Trade Organization, which propelled growth in the 2000s. A more market-based financial system will better channel household savings to productive uses. This means more credit to dynamic start-ups in the service sector'the type of firms currently squeezed out of the credit market. For this to work, the market for services needs to be more competitive, so these dynamic start-ups can actually start-up. Think healthcare, education, financial services, logistics, utilities, and telecom to name a handful. These new firms will, in turn, create jobs. And, the service sector tends to be more labor intensive than industry. More labor intensive growth means more household income, and higher household income means more consumption. Financial sector reform would also boost household income from investments directly. Bank deposits, where savings are often parked, have offered zero or often negative returns when adjusted for inflation. In a more market-based system, households would do much better than zero. **Slower but better** There's a catch: in this new model growth would be slower. In the coming years, taming rising risks in the economy'by reigning in credit growth and rationalizing investment'will likely slow the economy. Put simply, less stimulus means less growth. Reform itself could also entail adjustment costs in the transition, with some short run impact on growth. We estimate that with reforms China's growth could average around 6 percent a year from now to 2030. By all measures'except perhaps China's 10 percent average annual growth over the past 30 years'this would be a fantastic outcome. Especially when compared to a status-quo scenario, in which China could very well get stuck in the middle-income trap and income per person would peak at around 25 percent of that in the United States in 2030. In contrast, with successful reforms, income per person in China could reach 40 percent of the U.S. level by 2030. The new model would also deliver higher quality growth. Higher quality because it would improve living standards by boosting employment, income, and consumption; use less natural resources and be more environmentally friendly; and, most importantly, be sustainable. **Good for China and Good for the World ** Somewhat slower growth in the near-term is a tradeoff worth making for higher future income. This is clearly good not only for China, but also the world economy. By 2030 China'especially with successful reforms'will almost certainly be the world's largest economy. So China's success'which will substantially increase income in China'will also mean much higher global demand and will thus be hugely important for a robust and healthy global economy. Less growth in China today in exchange for more, much more, income in the future. So, less is indeed more.

Pundits' views on China's economy bounce around'often rapidly'between these descriptions. Just two short months ago, the dominant concern was about a sharp slowdown, below this year's official growth target of 7\u00c2? percent. Now, these fears have retreated, pushed aside by talk of renewed momentum. Our sense, here at the International Monetary Fund, has always been that economic growth will slightly surpass this year's official target. But [we have also cautioned that China's economic challenges are growing, and that accelerating reform is critical for containing risks and achieving a smooth transition to sustainable growth. The upcoming Third Plenum provides an opportunity for the new leadership to provide guidance on how they plan to meet these challenges. **The challenges ahead** After three decades of unprecedented expansion, during which nearly 500 million people have been raised out of poverty, China's growth model is under stress. Pressure points are beginning to develop in the financial sector and in local government finances. This, against a backdrop of an aging population. These strains arise from a development strategy heavily reliant on capital accumulation and the relocation of surplus labor from the countryside to urban factories. China's stock of credit is among the highest in the world and growing fast, particularly in the non-bank segment. In the past four years alone, the stock of credit as a share of GDP has risen at breathtaking speed from around 140 percent to 200 percent. Elsewhere, rapid credit growth of this kind has often been accompanied by widespread mispricing of risk and a buildup of asset quality problems. And while the emergence of non-bank intermediaries marks a shift toward more market-based intermediation, these institutions also pose risks by mobilizing short-term deposits to lend for longer maturities without the same capital buffers, provisioning, or regulatory rules that banks adhere to. On the other side of this rapid credit expansion is the large buildup in debt, including at the level of local governments. Infrastructure spending by local governments has often been used as a counter-cyclical tool to stabilize activity in the face of shocks''even more so since the global financial crisis. Since local governments are generally constrained in how they raised revenue, and are not permitted to borrow directly from the markets, they have tended to channel infrastructure funding through off-budget financing vehicles. Augmenting the reported public debt numbers to include this additional infrastructure-related borrowing, our sense is that the general government debt is around 45 percent of GDP (twice the official number). This is still manageable, but it does suggest less fiscal space to deal with unanticipated events than the reported headline number indicates. The inter-related risks in the financial sector and local government finances reflect deeper vulnerabilities along the current growth path, which remains heavily dependent on capital accumulation. Capacity continues to be built well ahead of final consumer demand and returns to capital are diminishing. And demographic trends suggest surplus labor will be exhausted by around 2020, so it will become more difficult to offset diminishing returns by relocating surplus labor from the countryside to factories. Put together, the growth model which has delivered spectacular results for China in recent decades looks increasingly unsustainable. **What's to be done?** Shifting to a sustainable growth path''one that uses resources more efficiently, is more inclusive, and more consumer-based''requires actions on several fronts: financial sector and fiscal reforms, as well as structural measures. Further financial reforms are essential to contain the buildup of risks, enhance the efficiency of investment, and boost household capital income. The main dimensions of reform are deposit rate liberalization; the elimination of perceived widespread implicit guarantees on financial products and intermediaries through the introduction of deposit insurance, and a formal resolution framework for failing institutions; and gradually moving away from administrative guidance on credit allocation to adopting a policy rate as the main operating target for monetary policy. Fiscal reforms, including giving local governments authority over their own revenue sources more in line with their expenditure mandates; shifting the tax burden toward progressive and efficient forms of taxation; and channeling dividend payments from state-owned enterprises to the budget; all these measures will complement financial sector reforms in addressing the vulnerabilities in local government finances, reducing excess investment, and boosting household consumption. The third broad area''structural measures''will reinforce the impact of financial and fiscal reforms and enable a shift toward a growth model less reliant on capital accumulation and more dependent on the efficient use of resources ('total factor productivity' growth). The measures include leveling the playing field within and across sectors through deregulation and easing barriers to entry (particularly in services); raising resource prices to rationalize investment and protect the environment; and reforming the hukou (household registration) system to improve labor market mobility and achieve a more efficient matching of workers to vacancies. **Eyes on the Third Plenum** Implementing these significant measures is a tall order and involves tough choices, including possibly accepting slower growth as the economy adjusts to the new path. But starting now will allow China to sustain its convergence to the level of higher income economies and deliver the benefits of growth to an ever-wider cross section of its population in a way that's environmentally sustainable and sound. But delay reforms and the challenges grow larger, raising the probability of stalled convergence. China's leadership recognizes the challenges and has already indicated their reform objectives. The priority now is to lay out and then, critically, implement concrete reform plans to manage the transition to a new growth path. It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, [Deng Xiaoping famously said, so long as it catches mice. Expectations are high for a similar sense of far- sighted pragmatism at the Third Plenum to shape the course of China's economy over the next decade and beyond.

The idea of a coordinated policy effort to revive Japan's economy and end deflation seemed a bold idea, but also a long-shot. Back in February, several young investment bankers told me that ending deflation within the next few years stood at most, a 20 percent chance. They noted that they had never experienced rising prices in their lifetimes. By June they had upped the chances of success to 40 percent. With Abenomics approaching the one-year mark,[ is the new strategy working? **Lot of policy action** The year started with a flurry of new policy initiatives: in January, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) adopted a 2 percent inflation target, followed by new fiscal stimulus, and a decision to join negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposal for a free trade agreement spanning countries from Australia, Brunei, to Chile, Canada, and the U.S. Shortly after, Haruhiko Kuroda took the helm at the Bank of Japan and introduced Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing'an aggressive plan to reach 2 percent inflation in about 2 years mainly through large-scale bond purchases. Just, a few days ago, the government agreed to go ahead with the consumption tax increase in 2014 and announced further fiscal stimulus to soften the growth impact. Discussions on growth reforms are next on the agenda, with a special Diet session starting this month. Plenty of action, but has this whirlwind of activity paid off? **Signs of a turnaround** The strength of the recovery in the first half of this year has surprised many. The rebound in equity markets, yen depreciation, and new public spending all contributed to a remarkable turnaround, with growth reaching almost 4 percent in the first six month of the year. That said, the transition to a private demand-led recovery is still at an early stage. Private investment has not taken off and labor markets, while tighter, have not generated much wage growth. A good start, yes, but not a homerun. What about prices? Inflation turned positive in June helped by higher energy import costs, and long-term inflation expectations have risen. But most core prices are still falling and monetary easing is slow to transmit to the economy: most of the liquidity pumped into the economy is flowing right back to the BoJ in the form of growing bank reserves. Some banks have begun to rethink their investment strategies and bank lending has begun to rise, but in aggregate the new easing has not lead to substantial portfolio rebalancing or capital outflows, contributing to a relatively stable exchange rate since July. Probably the most noticeable achievement has been continued low and stable long-term interest rates, despite the rise in inflation expectations and a steepening of yield curves, overseas, especially in the US. This has helped bring real interest rates down. **But Abenomics has still a way to go** The truth is that there is no clear benchmark against which Abenomics can be assessed. Japan's history of mild deflation and subdued growth makes it very hard to predict a path to recovery. But if Abenomics is to succeed, progress along several dimensions should be expected. Key milestones are: self-sustaining growth propelled by investment, employment, and earnings growth; a re-anchoring of inflation expectations at 2 percent and a steady rise in headline inflation driven by price increases of non-food and non-energy items; finally, successful Abenomics should lead to falling real interest rates as monetary easing keeps nominal interest rates low. Against these metrics, Abenomics has done well, but it also has some ways to go. **Growth reforms are needed** For Abenomics to work, Japan's long-term economic problems need to be tackled in a convincing manner. In other words, strategies for raising trend growth and reducing public debt need be put in place. The consumption tax increase has sent a clear signal that the government is serious about fiscal reform. A similar resolve is needed on growth reforms'the third arrow of Abenomics. Discussions have been underway for some time on a new growth strategy, including labor market reform, deregulation, and efforts to revamp the agricultural sector. While these are all important areas, there is now a premium on concrete action. Japan needs a signature initiative similar to the consumption tax increase on the fiscal side. The upcoming special session in Japan's legislative arm, the Diet, this October provides an opportunity to take action and keep the reform momentum going. Just one year ago, Japan was entering its third recession in 5 years, and the outlook seemed bleak. To avoid getting stuck again, the rapid pace of reforms needs to continue and, especially, extend to structural reforms. While there is no guarantee that it all will work, Abenomics has generated'for the first time in a long time'a real chance to bring Japan back on the road of sustained growth. And Japan's economic prospects will be among the issues discussed at an IMF sponsored seminar 'Abenomics approaching its one-year mark\" taking place in Tokyo on October 29.

As the global growth momentum shifts from the emerging to the advanced economies, the strength of domestic economic policies will be crucial for how countries can cope with the combination of lower commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions. Lower commodity prices have already started to affect the region's commodity exporters. Even though prices remain high by historical standards, countries can no longer count on the tailwind from ever-improving terms of trade, which had propelled economic activity over the past decade. Meanwhile, longer-term U.S. interest rates have started to rise, with knock-on effects for emerging markets. Across all of the financially integrated economies of Latin America, bond yields have increased, equity prices have fallen, and currencies have depreciated since May, when the U.S. Fed first mentioned the possibility of tapering its bond purchases later this year. Financial conditions remain fairly benign for now, but the strong tailwind from ultra-low external financing costs may also be gone for good. Against this backdrop, economic activity across the region has continued to moderate. As detailed in our latest [_Regional Economic Update_, presented in Washington, D.C. today, we project growth this year at 2\u00c2\u00be percent, the lowest rate in ten years, with the exception of 2009. For 2014, we are projecting a pick-up to about 3 percent, but even this rate remains well below the average annual growth of 4 percent observed between 2003 and 2012. The outlook holds particular risks and uncertainties for those economies in the region that depend heavily on commodity exports and are less well placed to benefit from higher U.S. growth. **Strong domestic policies are key** With less supportive external conditions in the offing, the strength of domestic economic policies will be crucial for how individual countries can cope. Fortunately, many of the larger economies in the region are in a good position to weather more challenging times, as policy frameworks and economic fundamentals have been strengthened over the past decade. Banking systems are generally healthy and well-funded; external debt is moderate; official foreign exchange reserves are sizable; and flexible exchange rates are acting as a useful buffer for shocks, while allowing countries to adjust monetary policy within their inflation targeting frameworks.[ Still, there are reasons for caution. Fiscal balances are generally weaker than they were on the eve of the global financial crisis, reflecting expansionary policies since then (see Figure 1). External current account deficits have widened, creating a potential vulnerability at a time of tightening external funding conditions (see Figure 2). The long period of very loose credit conditions has also encouraged greater risk-taking and some build-up in leverage that may have created pockets of financial fragility. Finally, economic activity in several countries is bumping against supply constraints that reflect insufficient investment in infrastructure and other policy shortcomings. [ **Avoid fiscal stimulus ** How should policymakers deal with these challenges? The first priority is to calibrate macroeconomic policies appropriately. Even though near-term growth is projected to be well below recent cyclical highs, output is generally close to potential. In fact, tight labor markets, infrastructure bottlenecks, and sizable current account deficits all point to very limited spare capacity in most of the larger economies. Under those circumstances, now is not the time to respond to a slowdown with fresh stimulus. Fiscal policymakers, in particular, should be wary of extending themselves further, especially since the expansion launched in response to the global financial crisis is yet to be reversed. This is not to say that policymakers should sit on their hands. The period ahead is likely to bring fresh shocks and bouts of volatility that need to be handled carefully. For the most part, monetary policy and flexible exchange rates provide the right tools to cope with such shocks. In case of sudden large pressures for capital outflows, central banks should also stand ready to use foreign exchange interventions to preserve orderly market conditions. However, it is important not to try and defend exchange rates at fundamentally unsustainable levels, or to use interventions as a substitute for a necessary tightening of macro policies. More broadly, there is no better insurance against market pressures than maintaining credible policy frameworks and strong buffers. **Focus on structural reforms to boost medium-term growth** Looking beyond short-term stabilization policy, it is clear that the region will require extra efforts to ensure sustainable, robust growth over the medium term. Structural reforms should aim squarely at boosting productivity and addressing the chronic shortage of domestic saving to finance investment. Redirecting budgetary resources toward critical capital spending, enhancing the quality of education, and improving the business climate are but a few examples of what is needed across much of the region. In sum, an exceptionally bright decade has come to an end, and policy frameworks in the region will have to stand the test of less favorable weather conditions over the period ahead. With the right emphasis on macroeconomic prudence and targeted structural reforms, Latin America and the Caribbean should be able to shine even under cloudier skies.

Certainly taxation has been much to the fore of public debate in the last few years. The latest[ _Fiscal Monitor_ takes a close look at where tax systems now stand, and where they might, and should be headed. Can we tax better, could we'if we wanted to'raise more revenue, and how does fairness come into it? **A better way to tax** The IMF's broad advice on the revenue side of consolidation is straightforward. * Before raising rates, broaden bases by scaling back exemptions and special treatments, and thereby getting more people and entities to pay taxes; * Rely more on taxing consumption rather than labor; * Strengthen property taxes; and * Seize opportunities to raise revenue while correcting environmental and other distortions by, not least, carbon pricing (to address climate and other pollution challenges). How have the advanced countries done relative to this advice? Not especially well. Increases in rates of value-added tax, or VAT, for instance, have been more evident than has broadening of the tax base. Many countries have increased social contribution rates (linked to the financing of pensions and the like, but often affecting workers much like a tax). And effective carbon pricing is as remote as ever. There are exceptions. Portugal has managed significant VAT base broadening. And thirteen or so countries have adopted bank levies of the kind that the Fund recommended back in 2010. But, overall, countries have honored the advice largely in the breach. **Taxing times** There is no 'right'\u009d size of government'that varies with countries' circumstances and social preferences**.** As a technical matter, however, one can ask how the revenue that a country raises compares with the revenue raised by other, similarly placed, countries. The _Fiscal_ _Monitor_ provides country-by-country estimates of what we call '\u009dtax effort'\u009d'essentially, how well a country is currently doing on raising tax revenue when compared to other countries that are similar in per capita income and other characteristics. This pattern is quite complex, but the chart conveys a sense that for the advanced economies, effort is already in many cases high'a score of 1.0 on the horizontal axis means that a country is raising pretty much the most one could expect. The vertical axis represents the additional effort needed in terms of garnering enough tax revenue to help them meet half of their consolidation needs (as defined in the Fiscal _Monitor_). The chart also shows that several countries, including notably the United States, whose 'effort'\u009d is relatively low could meet a good part of their consolidation needs by fairly modest increases.** ** [ The estimated effort in emerging markets and low-income countries (not shown in the chart) is, on average, not especially low. But there is nonetheless in many cases scope to raise more. For instance, low-income countries with 'effort'\u009d below their group median could raise 3.5 points of GDP more by rising to that level. The _Fiscal __Monitor_ also looks at how to realize this unexploited revenue potential. How much of the gap is due to poor policy versus how much is from avoidance and evasion? What we find, broadly, is that while flawed design is the predominant problem in most advanced economies, elsewhere improving compliance is the key. **The fairness factor** The current focus on international tax avoidance reminds us that for people to accept a tax system as legitimate, they must also see it as fair. Progressivity has fallen a lot over the last three decades or so, and inequality has increased. So we ask whether the rich _could _pay more. We first calculate the top rate of tax that would maximize revenue in advanced economies, putting it in a range of percentages, and compare that with what the top marginal rates now actually are (Chart 2). In many cases, current top rates are below, or to the lower end of, the estimated range of revenue- maximizing rates. Whether top rates _should_ be raised depends on social judgments that we try to clarify in the _Fiscal_ _Monitor_ but ultimately leave to the reader. [ **Making good tax reform happen** Recent experience confirms that hard economic times are generally not good times for tax reform. While there is no silver bullet, the experiences reviewed in the _Fiscal __Monitor _point to clear lessons. Transparency is critical, but may not be enough. Effective communication is essential'only if people are persuaded that taxes are being raised fairly and will be put to good use, will they support reform.

It can continue to muddle through, and hope that growth in the world economy will eventually pick up enough steam to pull its economy out of the doldrums. Or it can make a decisive push to revitalize its economy and complete the reforms needed to achieve a fully integrated economic and monetary union Five years into the crisis, recovery in the euro area remains fragile. Important actions at both the national and euro-wide levels have tackled the immediate threats to the single currency. These include the European Central Bank's announcement in 2012 that it stands ready to undertake outright monetary transactions in secondary sovereign bond markets, the completion of the European Stability Mechanism, which created a financial firewall around the euro area, and efforts to restore the health of public finances and implement structural reforms. But countries on the euro area periphery are still recovering from recession and there is also weakness in some core countries. Financial markets remain fragmented and unemployment, especially among young people, and in the periphery, is at record highs. In the hardest-hit countries, the social fabric has started to fray, reform fatigue is setting in, and politics have become increasingly polarized. **The risk of stagnation** Against this backdrop, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which the euro area enters a period of prolonged stagnation. Suppose that financial fragmentation persists, and loans remain expensive for companies in the periphery. In the face of high private debt and continued uncertainty, households and firms remain reluctant to spend and invest. As unemployed workers lose skills and new workers find it difficult to join the labor force, the productive capacity of the economy is permanently damaged'and so is the social fabric. Clearly, this would not be a desirable outcome. But if reform efforts stall, it is the most likely one. Economic activity in the euro area today is still below what it was in 2008, before the global financial crisis. In 2012, GDP in the euro area contracted by 0.6 percent of GDP. And despite recent signs of a gradual recovery in the second half of 2013, inflation is expected to remain subdued and unemployment remains elevated. **The path to growth** There is an alternative future'one that is premised on higher growth and a brighter outlook for all of Europe. But reviving growth and creating jobs will not be easy. It will require action on multiple fronts, and at the same time. There are four key areas that require immediate attention. * **Complete the banking union**. This would entail expediting reforms already under way, including a final agreement on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive by the European Parliament and progress on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. European partners should agree on a strong single resolution mechanism based on a centralized authority, supported by a common backstop, with powers to trigger resolution and make decisions on burden-sharing to ensure timely and least-cost resolution. * **Restore the health of bank portfolios**. To raise confidence, a credible assessment of the quality of banks' assets is needed. Such an assessment would quantify capital needs and should be accompanied by a clear plan on how to meet these needs. Where private capital is insufficient, credible backstops'in some cases, the ESM'will be essential to preserve banks' ability to continue lending. * **Take further steps to support demand in the near term**. The IMF has supported the ECB's commitment to keep the monetary policy stance accommodative for as long as necessary. Further monetary easing is needed to support demand, while unconventional measures could help reduce fragmentation. In addition, fiscal adjustment in euro area countries should be focused on structural targets and carefully designed to avoid an excessive drag on growth. In the medium term, the euro area also needs to move toward fiscal union. * **Push ahead with structural reforms.** Tackling structural rigidities'at both the euro area and the national levels'would raise potential growth and promote rebalancing within the euro area. Implementation of the Services Directive could encourage cross-border competition and raise productivity, while national efforts to address labor market weaknesses would boost competitiveness and employment. A new round of free trade agreements'preferably of the multilateral kind'could also help boost productivity. **Choosing the right moment** The path to higher growth will not be easy. Reforms such as the ones listed above are extremely difficult for policymakers to address. Structural reforms often take years to yield results, requiring policymakers to convince their electorates to go along with painful measures in the short term for gains in the medium and long term. The challenge becomes even greater at the European level, when the 17 countries that are members of the euro area'or the 28 countries that make up the European Union'have to agree to reforms that reach deep into areas that used to fall exclusively under the prerogative of national sovereignty. This is where politics come in. Understanding the importance of electoral cycles and being ready to seize the moment when a window of political opportunity opens up is vital for effective economic reform. Sometimes, the best strategy is to move on many fronts at once. The policy actions I have listed above would all be mutually reinforcing. For instance, measures to improve the flow of credit in the periphery would boost investment and job creation, which in turn would help restore competitiveness and raise growth. While it may appear daunting, the political challenge of achieving greater integration now is probably easier than having to deal over the long term with the political consequences of protracted stagnation. And the payoff could be substantial. The IMF's analysis suggests that the benefits of a comprehensive reform effort'tackling financial fragmentation and structural weaknesses at the same time'could raise the level of euro area and global output by about 3 percent and 1 percent respectively within five years. Think of the difference that could make to the lives of millions of people in Europe and beyond.

On the positive side, deficit-cutting efforts and the first signs of recovery reduced the fiscal stress felt in many advanced economies; but debt ratios often remain at historical peaks. At the same time, slowing growth and rising borrowing costs, combined with unabated demands for improved public services, puts pressure on government budgets in emerging market economies. So we created an index of 'fiscal difficulty' that shows the biggest challenge ahead for advanced economies is to maintain budget surpluses until debt ratios return to lower levels. We expect this will take several years. **Advanced economies: not yet at the goal line** With the average deficit now lower by more than 4 percentage points of GDP compared to the height of the crisis, most advanced economies are well on their way to meeting their medium-term fiscal objectives of bringing their public debt ratio down to more comfortable levels. The IMF's [_Fiscal Monitor_ estimates that those that need to make the most progress on deficit reduction are almost two- thirds of the way there'with the exception of Japan. This does not mean that the last mile will be the easiest. To understand how difficult the remaining effort could be, we drew from past experiences with fiscal consolidation and constructed an index that measures 'fiscal difficulty.'\u009d The index can be used to gauge the relative difficulty for countries under various fiscal adjustment scenarios. We looked at two things: * the difficulty in reaching a given primary surplus over a given period of time (this is illustrated on the vertical axis of the chart below), and * the difficulty in maintaining that surplus for another given period of time (the horizontal axis of the chart). [ It's clear from the chart that'at least for most countries'maintaining budget surpluses for the extended period of time required to bring debt ratios down is the most challenging, as 'adjustment fatigue'\u009d creeps in. This is particularly relevant in Europe, where economic growth remains weak, and only adds further pressure to an already constrained budget. **Emerging market economies: mounting budget pressures** Fiscal vulnerabilities have been increasing in emerging market economies during the last couple of years. This is mostly due to two factors. First, the interest rate and growth environment has deteriorated. Growth forecasts have been revised down by as much as 1\u00c2\u00be percentage points on average, and borrowing costs have increased, especially in Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa. Second, deficits have widened and debt ratios increased in many countries as they'in most cases, appropriately'let automatic stabilizers operate and used fiscal stimulus to contain the impact of the global crisis. In some countries, quasi-fiscal activities such as subsidized lending by state-owned banks or off-budget activities by local governments and other public institutions have added to vulnerabilities. That being said, the severity of the fiscal challenge varies across the emerging world: some countries have high debt and deficits, and thus pressing consolidation needs; in others, rising risks put more emphasis on initiating the consolidation process; still others remain in a relatively comfortable fiscal position. But overall, the scope for short-term discretionary fiscal action has but evaporated. And continued demands for more and better public services in the developing world raise significant medium-term challenges. [ If fiscal adjustment is the order the day across most of the globe, countries must more than ever make sure they tax as efficiently, fairly, and effectively as they can.

These transitions will be challenging because they are accompanied by substantial risks. **So what are these transitions?** * The first one is the transition in the United States from a prolonged period of monetary accommodation towards a normalization of monetary conditions. Will this transition be smooth or bumpy? * Second, emerging markets face a transition to more volatile external conditions and higher risk premiums. What needs to be done to keep emerging markets resilient? * Third, the euro area is moving to a stronger union and stronger financial systems. This report focuses on the close links between the corporate and banking sectors. What are the implications of the corporate debt overhang for bank health? * Fourth, Japan is moving towards the new policy regime of Abenomics. The stakes are high. Will Japan's policies be comprehensive enough to ensure stability? * And finally, there is the global transition to a safer financial system, where much remains to be done. **_U.S monetary transition and global impact_** **So will the transition to monetary normalization in the United States be smooth or bumpy? **This process will be unprecedented and complex. Long-term interest rates could overshoot. Containing longer-term interest rates and market volatility has already proven to be a substantial challenge, as shown by the sharp rise in bond yields and volatility since May. Lower market liquidity and over-extended allocations to bonds could amplify these risks.**** **Higher interest rates may also reveal weak links in the shadow banking system**, exacerbating market and liquidity strains**.** One example is mortgage real estate investment trusts. Like the structured investment vehicles and the conduits before the crisis, mortgage real estate investment trusts are highly leveraged and susceptible to funding runs. They could be forced to sell their asset holdings quickly, causing disruption in the mortgage-backed securities market, which could spread to broader asset markets. **Engineering a smooth transition to monetary normalization** will require a clear and well-timed communication strategy by the U.S. Federal Reserve to minimize interest rate volatility, as well as effective execution in line with economic developments. Increased macro-prudential oversight and transparency in the shadow banking system is essential to preserve financial stability. This will allow the Fed to keep its focus on ensuring a smooth exit. **_Emerging markets_** **What happens as the tide of capital inflows recedes from emerging markets? **Since the Lehman crisis, bond inflows into emerging markets have risen by more than one trillion dollars. This is well above its long-term trend by almost half a trillion dollars, boosting emerging market corporate borrowing to record levels. **** Events since May of this year point to new financial stability concerns. Foreign investors play a bigger role in local debt markets. But market liquidity has deteriorated in recent years, making local interest rates more sensitive to changes in investor sentiment. At the same time, corporate balance sheets have weakened, financial vulnerabilities are rising, and economic growth is slowing. This exposes these countries to more severe market stress. If economies are faced with significant capital outflows, steps will need to be taken to ensure orderly market conditions and to facilitate smooth portfolio adjustments. Keeping emerging markets resilient also requires countries to address domestic vulnerabilities and enhance policy credibility. **_Euro area_** Key challenges remain in Europe. Policy actions at the regional and national levels have reduced funding pressures on weaker sovereigns and banks, but credit is still hampered by financial fragmentation. The [_Global Financial Stability Report_ also shows that a significant share of the corporate debt in stressed economies is now owed by companies with weak debt servicing capacity. This is what we call a debt overhang. We estimate that even if financial fragmentation were reversed, a persistent debt overhang would remain, amounting to almost one- fifth of the combined corporate debt of Italy, Portugal, and Spain. This debt overhang affects the banking system through losses on corporate loans. Some banks will need to increase provisioning against these expected losses. This could absorb a large portion of future bank profits and, in some cases, capital. A number of policy actions are required to address the legacy of weak corporate and bank balance sheets in the euro area. The corporate debt overhang needs to be addressed in a more comprehensive manner. This may involve debt clean-ups, improvements to bankruptcy frameworks, or special asset management companies to restructure loans. As for banks, the planned balance sheet assessment and stress tests by the European authorities are a golden opportunity to conduct a thorough and transparent review of bank asset quality and to identify capital shortfalls. But credible backstops need to be put in place before the exercise is concluded to offset any identified shortfalls, if private funds are insufficient. A bolstering of bank balance sheets needs to go hand-in-hand with adequate progress towards banking union. **_Japan_** **As the U.S. is considering monetary normalization, Japan** **is scaling-up its monetary** **stimulus** under the Abenomics framework. Policymakers in Japan need to ensure that this policy package is implemented completely, because a failure to enact the planned fiscal and structural reforms could reignite deflation and intensify financial stability risks. **_Moving towards a safer financial system_** Finally, while progress is being made, we still need to complete the regulatory reform agenda, consistently implement the new rules across countries, and enhance supervision. We are not there yet. Much work remains to be done to achieve a safer global financial system. If the policy challenges that I have examined are properly managed, the transition towards greater financial stability should be successful and should provide a more robust platform for economic growth. We are on the road. We have the map. And now policymakers need to steer carefully to navigate the bumps in the road ahead'so that we can arrive safely at our destination.

We forecast growth in emerging markets and developing economies to be 4.5% this year, 5.1% next year, a downward revision of 0.5% and 0.4% respectively relative to our July forecasts. **These two evolutions are leading to tensions, with emerging market economies facing both the challenge of slowing growth and changing global financial conditions**. **Advanced economies slowly strengthening** Let me start with the U.S. Private demand continues to be strong, and on the assumption that fiscal accidents are avoided (the assumption that underlies our forecast), the recovery should strengthen. **It is time to make plans for exit from both quantitative easing and zero policy rates'although not time to implement them yet.** While there is no major technical issue involved in doing so, the communication problems facing the Fed are new and delicate. Looking forward, it is reasonable to expect some volatility in long rates. The recovery in **Japan** continues, but whether it can be sustained depends on Abenomics meeting two major challenges. The first, reflected in the debate about the increase in the consumption tax, is the right pace of fiscal consolidation: it has to be neither too slow to compromise credibility, nor too fast to kill growth. The second is a credible set of structural reforms to transform what is a cyclical recovery ginto sustained growth. Core **Europe** is, at last, showing some signs of recovery. This is not due to major policy changes, but partly to a change in mood, which could however be partly self fulfilling. Southern periphery countries are still struggling: definite progress on competitiveness and exports is not yet strong enough to offset depressed internal demand. In both core and periphery, uncertainty about bank balance sheets remains an issue, which the promised so called \"asset quality review\" should reduce. Taking the longer view, and just as for Japan, structural reforms are urgently needed to increase the anemic potential growth rate. **Emerging market growth weakening** The major news comes however from emerging market economies, where growth has declined, often more than we had forecast in July. The obvious question is whether this reflects a cyclical slowdown, or a decrease in potential growth. Based on what we know today, the answer is both. Unusually favorable world conditions, be it strong commodity prices or global financial conditions, led to higher potential growth in the 2000s, with, in a number of countries, a cyclical component on top. As commodity prices are stabilizing, and financial conditions tightening, potential growth is lower, in some cases compounded by a sharp cyclical adjustment. **Confronted with these changes, governments in emerging market economies face two challenges: adjust to lower potential growth, and, where needed, deal with the cyclical adjustment**. On the first, while some decrease in growth relative to the 2000s is inevitable, structural reforms can help and are becoming more urgent. The list is familiar, from rebalancing towards consumption in China, to removing barriers to investment in India or Brazil. On the second challenge, standard advice also applies: countries with large fiscal deficits must consolidate. Countries with inflation running persistently above target must tighten and, often more importantly, put in place a more credible monetary policy framework. The increase in U.S. long-term interest rates makes the advice even more relevant. Normalization of interest rates in advanced countries is likely to lead to a partial reversal of the earlier capital flows. As investors repatriate funds, countries with weaker fiscal positions or higher inflation are particularly exposed. The right response for emerging market countries must be twofold. First, where needed, to put their macro house in order, to clarify the monetary policy framework, and to maintain fiscal sustainability. Second, to let the exchange rate depreciate in response to outflows. Foreign currency exposure, which led to adverse effects of depreciation in the past, is more limited today, and emerging market economies should be able to adjust to the changed environment without major difficulties. I have not focused on low income countries. The good news here is that they continue, in general, to be quite resilient. Nevertheless, looking forward, they will also face a more challenging environment. **In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly**. While the focus at this time is more on emerging market economies, other legacies of the crisis are still very much present and advanced economies are not out of the woods. Public debt, and in some cases, private debt, remain very high, and fiscal sustainability is not a given. The architecture of the financial system is still evolving, and its future shape and solidity are still unclear. Unemployment remains too high. These will remain major challenges for many years to come.

After a decade of high growth and a swift rebound after the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, emerging markets are seeing slowing growth. Their average growth is now 1\u00c2? percentage points lower than in 2010 and 2011. This is a widespread phenomenon: growth has been slowing in roughly three out of four emerging markets. This share is remarkably high; in the past, such synchronized and persistent slowdowns typically have only occurred during acute crises. [Our analysis attributes the slowdown in part to cyclical forces, including softer external demand and in part to structural bottlenecks, for example in infrastructure, labor markets, power sector. And this has happened in spite of supportive domestic macroeconomic policies, (still) favorable terms of trade, and easy financing conditions, which only began to tighten recently. However, a non-trivial portion of the slowdown remains unexplained, suggesting that other factors common to emerging markets are at play. **Is lower growth here to stay?** [The current slowdown raises the question of whether emerging markets can bounce back to the growth rates seen in the last decade, or if their prospects are dimmer than we thought a few years ago. Strong external demand and developing supply chains brought higher growth through trade and specialization in the 2000s. And prudent policies paid off. Countries that managed their economies well in the 'good times'\u009d had more firepower to deal with the global financial crisis. Conversely, economies with large external and financial imbalances, including much of emerging Europe, are going through a painful deleveraging process and have experienced a more protracted recovery since Lehman. Whether this slowdown is long lasting depends on how much of it is considered _structural_' jargon used by economists to reflect fundamental changes in an economy's growth potential. But growth potential is an unobservable metric. Taking into account the fact that cheap financing and rising commodity prices over the past decade raised investment and growth in many economies, and the fact that those favorable tailwinds are fading, we estimate that emerging market's 'potential'\u009d growth needs to be revised down. IMF forecasts for growth five years ahead are down by 0.7 percentage points compared to October 2012. Market analysts have made similar downward revisions. What this means is that policymakers in emerging markets need to recognize that they will grow at lower rates than in the past. Otherwise, they risk over stimulating their economies and generating imbalances that will come back to haunt them. But there are things that they can do to generate higher sustainable growth. **Back to the future'renewed emphasis on old challenges** This discussion takes on added significance when we take into account the imminent tightening of global interest rates. Following the U.S. Fed's tapering announcement, some emerging markets have seen large and disruptive capital outflows. And more vulnerable emerging markets, those with high and growing current account deficits and high inflation, have seen sharper exchange rate depreciation and bond-yield increases. Policies will be critical in the period ahead, as investors will increasingly differentiate between emerging market countries according to their policy frameworks and health of their balance sheets. How can emerging markets get their groove back? At the risk of restating what may seem like 'old hat,'\u009d countries will need to identify reform priorities to remove supply bottlenecks, boost productivity and move their economies up in the value chain of economic activities. This means addressing lingering barriers to long-term growth' pushing ahead with infrastructure investment and improving the business climate, for example. Countercyclical demand management policies will no longer do the trick. The stakes are high and the need for decisive policy action is now. Given the time it takes to implement structural measures and the natural lags with which the economy will respond, emerging market rebound will not be fast or easy. But they will have to start soon if they want to avoid the risk of a lost decade.

Five years into the economic crisis credit is still barely growing, and even declining in many advanced economies. Weak credit growth is a major factor holding back the economic recovery and governments have tried every policy they can come up with to jumpstart credit. Still, banks don't seem to want to lend. Or is it the corporate sector and households that can't afford to borrow? Many feel these policies are not working. What are policymakers to do? [Our analysis in the most recent _Global Financial Stability Report_ tries to shed light on all this darkness to help countries figure out how to make these policies work. It turns out there is no cookie-cutter solution: the problem differs from country to country and changes over time. For example, in a number of euro area countries, a lackluster demand for loans limited credit growth early in the crisis, but then banks became reluctant to supply more loans as the crisis in Europe intensified in 2012. So what tactic should countries use? Policies are most effective if they correctly target the underlying factors that are constraining credit. So, in those euro area countries in my example, for policies to be effective they should have aimed to support the demand for credit early in the crisis (by say alleviating over-indebtedness in firms and households), and then shifted to support credit supply (for instance, by cleaning up bank balance sheets). **A tough job for policymakers** Such nimbleness in policymaking is always easier said than done. In this case, it is especially tough, since finding the factors underlying credit weakness turns out to be very difficult. We cannot observe these factors directly, and they can affect the demand for and supply of credit in various ways. They also interact with each other, and change over time. We propose a step-by-step approach to help countries: first, using data from lending surveys, we can try to disentangle general demand and supply factors, arguing that this distinction offers a first cut to target policies, which can differ substantially depending on whether policies target credit supply or demand. A second, more challenging step then tries to pinpoint the specific factors that have been constraining credit growth. We applied this framework to a few countries for which sufficient data are available and found that no two countries' issues are alike nor are they frozen in time. For example, we found that in the United States, corporate credit was constrained early in the crisis by a substantial tightening of lending standards in banks, but that these constraints have since dissipated. Supply constraints have more recently resurfaced in some euro-area countries, ", "index": 409}, {"pub": "9/30/2013", "title": "Bending with the Winds of International Capital Flows", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6463", "content": " [By:[ John Simon _The__ winds may fell the massive oak, but bamboo, bent even to the ground, will spring upright after the passage of the storm._ - _Japanese Proverb_ Capital flows to emerging market economies are a source of particular and enduring concern to many policymakers. As seen in the 1997-98 Asian crisis, surging inflows can fuel excessive credit growth, expanded current account deficits, appreciated exchange rates and a loss of competitiveness'followed by painful adjustment when the inflows reverse. Countries often fight these buffeting winds with tight controls on exchange rates, capital flow management and aggressive interest rate movements. While these sometimes work, and [are sometimes the best response to a crisis, all too often countries can find themselves felled by the wind like the massive oak. In the most recent[ World Economic Outlook we discuss an approach to dealing with volatile international capital flows that emphasizes the soft and flexible response to capital flows rather than the hard and oak-like. Instead of trying to resist foreign inflows, countries can bend. We find that the countries that proved to be more resilient to the turbulent gusts of international capital flows were not necessarily those that controlled the inflows, but those where foreign inflows were balanced by offsetting resident outflows. **What is soft is strong** But what does this look like in practice? What distinguishes countries where volatile capital inflows are balanced by offsetting resident outflows from those where they fuel destabilizing current account booms and busts? We find that these countries typically have: * strong institutions, such as independent inflation targeting central banks as well as fiscal policy rules that result in lower inflation and more countercyclical fiscal policy outcomes * stronger financial supervision and regulation * more flexible exchange rate regimes and limited restrictions on capital flows We also find that these resilient emerging markets are not merely lucky: they face foreign inflows that are just as volatile as in less resilient economies, they are no more wealthy than less resilient economies and their shares of resources and manufacturing are similar. Significantly, we observe that many of these economies were once just as vulnerable to international capital flows as some of today's economies. But, through a series of policy choices, they have been able to encourage much greater resilience in their economies. **Learning to bend with the wind** By looking closely at the process of transition in Chile, the Czech Republic, and Malaysia, we suggest steps that countries can take to develop their own resilience. Notably, we find that the transition can take place surprisingly quickly. Indeed, in some cases (such as the Czech Republic), countries were forced to adopt new policy regimes almost overnight as previous approaches proved unsustainable.**__** Each of the countries we study improved their prudential regulation to limit excessive risk taking by domestic financial institutions. The countries also took steps to encourage the development of their domestic financial systems. For example, in Chile, allowing pension funds to invest more of their assets overseas provided the catalyst for the development of foreign exchange derivatives markets that allowed both the pension funds and domestic firms to better manage their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. While in Malaysia there was a very deliberate and staged process whereby domestic financial strength was built before gradual re-opening of the financial account. Importantly, floating exchange rate regimes appear to be a key element in encouraging domestic residents to buffer foreign capital inflows. In countries with managed exchange rates, domestic residents commonly react in similar ways to foreign investors ' moving capital overseas when foreigners are withdrawing and keeping capital at home when foreigners are piling in. Conversely, in countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes, exchange rate fluctuations seem to serve to encourage domestic residents to repatriate funds when foreign residents are leaving. While the reasons for this balancing behavior are not yet fully understood, some theories suggest that this happens because domestic residents understand their own countries best. When foreigners are withdrawing, residents see buying opportunities because of their better knowledge of the economy. As Adam Smith put it over 300 years ago, 'every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can'\u00a6 He can know better the character and situation of the persons whom he trusts, and if he should happen to be deceived, he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress.'\u009d In sum, countries should consider cultivating the qualities of bamboo when contending with the winds of international capital flows ' by improving domestic policy institutions and providing the incentive and ability for private resident outflows to buffer volatile foreign inflows ' so that, when they are subject to turbulent capital inflows, they bend rather than break.

[ There is no magic number for how much sovereign debt an economy can shoulder. And, as bringing down debt by cutting government spending or raising taxes comes at the risk of reducing growth and employment in the short term, there are arguments to not proceed too hastily. But eventually debt will have to be put back on a downward path in many countries. This will help rebuild fiscal buffers and cope with the costs of aging. So, what should governments do? Our [new analysis takes a closer look at the historical record and key trade-offs. The bottom line: it is possible to reduce debt when growth is low. Ultimately perseverance should pay off. **The ins and outs of debt reduction** Contrary to common wisdom, there is a silver bullet to bring down government debt without pain'at least in principle. Higher economic growth, if it could be conjured, would do the trick. The faster GDP expands, the more revenues flow into the government budget, the less unemployment benefits are due, and the lower is the ratio of debt to GDP. But the current environment does not promise this kind of growth. On the contrary, worried about their own debt overhang, many households are spending cautiously; and where bank balance sheets are stretched, credit flows sparingly, holding back investment. Inflation is low, and attempts to raise it to lower the real value of debt could get out of hand if inflation expectations are not well anchored. This narrows the available debt-reduction paths down to the long, hard slog of fiscal consolidation'that is, government deficits will have to come down. And there are complications. In many cases, and especially when growth is weak and debt is high, fiscal adjustment can push the debt-to-GDP ratio in the opposite direction at first, as demand falls and growth drops. This recessionary impact lowers not only public revenue, but also the denominator in the debt ratio. While the cost of debt may fall if resolute consolidation signals credibility to investors, this effect rarely compensates for the lower demand in the short-run. Instead, if medium term fiscal plans are clear and strong budget institutions guarantee their implementation, a path of steady adjustment is preferable. Of course, if a country is at the brink of losing financial market access, there may be no option but to front-load fiscal effort. So, will fiscal effort pay off? The historical record argues that it will, eventually, but it also shows that it won't be easy when growth is low. For example, when looking at what drives changes in the debt-to-GDP ratios across advanced economies in the last few decades, fiscal balances play a key role'but so does growth. Indeed, debt reductions tend to be larger when growth rates are high and interest rates are low (see the bottom, left quadrant in the figure below). Debt reversals are fewer and smaller in an environment characterized by both low growth and high interest rates (top, right quadrant). [ Just as importantly, a government making a push to bring down debt is more likely to be successful in actually lowering debt when growth is high: only 26 percent of fiscal consolidation efforts (defined as a large adjustment in fiscal balances ignoring interest rate payments) were successful when growth is below a country's historical average. In contrast, when growth is above average, the success rate increases to 41 percent. **Past experience'reducing debt when growth is low is possible** Another way to learn from past experiences is to concentrate solely on countries that managed to bring down public debt in a significant fashion. Looking at 26 episodes of debt reductions in advanced economies since 1980 confirms that growth and fiscal effort are the main drivers. The more surprising finding is that there are some episodes where large debt reductions were achieved despite very difficult starting conditions of anemic growth and a very high debt burdens. So how was this done? [ A number of factors were at play, but hard work and a bit of luck played their parts. Most countries started to consolidate early, continued through the initial period of weak growth, and did not stop as growth recovered and debt began to fall. In many cases countries also profited from improving conditions in the form of falling short-term interest rates and the lift from a depreciating exchange rate and solid export growth'channels that are largely blocked for many countries in the current environment of near-zero central bank interest rates and slow global trade. [ **Bottom line: make haste, slowly** This leaves us with good and bad news. The good news is that high debt can be tamed even when growth is low. The bad news is that, fiscal consolidation will likely come with an initial price of lowering growth. This means that, where possible, consolidation should happen gradually, supported by credible medium- term plans that help to spread the effort over time. Any measures to increase medium-term growth, such as structural reforms, should also be enacted now. And, in some economies, there might be room to reduce the need for consolidation by privatizing government assets. But, if the past is any guide, for most countries bringing down the public debt-ratio will involve a good fiscal effort for a number of years.

But a strong rebound in durable goods, such as cars and electronics, has helped revive the manufacturing sector and has supported the post-recession recovery. As of early 2013, manufacturing output was only 4 percentage points below its pre-recession peak. Comparing across countries, the United States has performed more strongly than most of its G-7 counterparts, with the exception of Germany. Yet, the recovery in Germany has stagnated since mid-2011, while the U.S. recovery continues to gain steam. Is this strong rebound in U.S. manufacturing here to stay, or just a temporary phenomenon? **A lopsided recovery** Our new study, [The U.S. Manufacturing Recovery: Uptick or Renaissance?, looks at the U.S. manufacturing sector and shows that while the headline recovery numbers for U.S. manufacturing are impressive, they mask significant differences between the sectors producing durable goods and nondurable goods (such as food and clothing). The post-recession recovery has been driven almost entirely by a rebound in _durable goods_ production. On the other hand, nondurable goods have fared poorly'their production is still 10 percent below its pre-recession levels and only 6 percent above its trough. Even within the durable sector, production growth rates have varied substantially. Automobiles, computers and electronics, and machinery have driven the majority of the rebound. However, the rebounds in machinery and automobiles have strong cyclical components (both had declined substantially during the crisis), while growth in the production of computers and electronics has been unrelenting over the last decade. **The energy revolution** What factors can explain the strong rebound in durable goods production in the United States? Lower labor costs in the United States compared with those in emerging markets have been the most important factor in explaining the recent revival in U.S. manufacturing. But other factors, such as a more competitive real exchange rate (a depreciation of the dollar relative to other currencies, corrected for differences in inflation) and lower energy prices, may have also played a significant role. The increasing U.S. production of oil and gas through unconventional extraction techniques'such as natural gas extracted from shale rock formation'could provide a boost to the manufacturing sector. However, our analysis suggests that the 'pull'\u009d from the energy boom to manufacturing has been limited. Based on the scenarios in the[ _2013 Annual Energy Outlook_ by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, additional production of oil and gas would result in a positive contribution to manufacturing growth of around 0.1 ' 0.3 percentage points per year through the end of the decade. Nondurable goods, such as the production of chemicals or primary metals, would benefit much more than sectors that rebounded strongly from the recession, such as computers and electronics and automobiles. **Tapping into emerging markets ** While manufacturing production as a share of total GDP has been declining for decades, manufacturing exports as a percent of total exports have remained relatively stable. This continued strength can, in part, be explained by increased sales of nondurable goods, especially chemical products and plastic materials, to emerging markets over the past decade. While total production of nondurables remains weak post-recession, these sectors stand to gain the most from structural changes in the U.S. market, such as decreasing energy and labor costs. Exports of durable goods have been less impressive, but even here there is a bright spot. Export patterns have changed directions as growth in consumption of durable goods such as machinery have moved away from advanced economies to more dynamic markets, such as emerging Asia. Tapping into these fast-growing regions could therefore increase the contribution of manufacturing exports to U.S. medium-term growth. All in all, some sectors have rebounded strongly from the recession, but the viability of a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing largely hinges on a continued reduction in the wage gap between the U.S. and emerging markets, and lower domestic energy prices.

Anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve's exit from quantitative easing has dominated headlines in recent weeks. Half a world away, less conspicuously, but no less importantly, China, the globe's second largest economy, is designing its own policy adjustments: firstly, unwinding the fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped shield it from the Great Recession and lifted global growth (but which also created some vulnerabilities), and secondly transitioning out of a growth model that has generated spectacular growth over the last three decades, but which is now running out of fuel. Managed well, these twin adjustments would allow China to prolong its economic miracle in a sustainable way, with a significant positive impact for the rest of the world. **Why are these adjustments needed? ** In the years prior to the global crisis, China's economy was propelled by rapid productivity gains from forceful restructuring of the state-owned sector, a bold clean up of the banking system and the country's dramatic entry into the global trading system through accession to the World Trade Organization. These forces paved the way for a decade of growth powered by investment and exports. A similar big-bang is needed now, but this time centered on consumption and services. After the global crisis erupted, China has relied heavily on a mixture of loose monetary and quasi-fiscal policies to help weather the storm. While propping up growth, these policies have also left problems in their wake in the form of rising local government debt and an overstretched financial system. They have also arguably thrown the structure of the economy more out of kilter, by making it increasingly reliant on ever higher levels of (increasingly inefficient) investment and credit. The challenge for China now is to transition away from the credit and investment-led pattern of recent growth, to a more consumer-based and sustainable model. The latest [assessment of the Chinese economy by the International Monetary Fund has some ideas about how to achieve this. The new Chinese leadership is itself keenly aware of these challenges. It has repeatedly emphasized its unwillingness to support unsustainable growth through another dose of stimulus. Expectations are high that a bold new phase of reforms will be announced this fall, which will allow China to decisively shift the pattern of its growth. **So what should we be looking for during the coming months?** China's economy has slowed from the double-digit growth rates of the past but there are good reasons why, including demographic change and natural laws of gravity associated with catching up with the rest of the world. The trick is to stay calm as this happens and avoid shoring up growth excessively, while being ready to respond if the employment situation worsens significantly. So in the near term, China should begin to pull in credit growth (as signaled through the interbank market last month). In particular, consistent with recent official statements, credit flowing through the less well-regulated parts of the financial system'and to sectors that are already struggling with overcapacity and excess leverage'should be curbed, including through tighter regulation and supervision. At the same time, quasi-fiscal support through local governments'which has contributed to government debt rising to nearly 50 percent of GDP'should be unwound steadily to ensure that China's traditionally sound public finances remain strong in the years to come. Calibrating this withdrawal will be tricky, of course, given residual uncertainties about both the global recovery and domestic growth momentum. But if growth slows too sharply, there would be scope to quickly reverse gears on the fiscal side and provide some targeted stimulus. However, it should be very different from that of the last few years by being conducted through the budget (and not the banks and local government platforms) and be directed at supporting household incomes and consumption (and not the corporate sector and investment). This would help facilitate the second of the twin adjustments that China needs to make, as discussed below. **Growth for all** The other major task that the Chinese policymakers recognize is the need to steer the economy onto a different growth path'one that is more sustainable by being more consumer based, inclusive and environmentally friendly. With investment already accounting for nearly half of economic activity and exports unlikely to be as buoyant as in the pre-crisis years, consumption needs to become the main growth driver. Moreover, the capital and resource'intensive model of China's investment-led growth has had unfortunate by'products in the form of damaging pollution and high levels of inequality. To engineer the shift, China will have to rely on market forces and price signals, to help banks and firms discover new growth engines in a changed global and domestic environment. Reforming the financial system and the corporate sector will be paramount in this context, so as to make funding available on more market-based terms to a broader set of borrowers who can use the money to invest in a new range of sectors, including both domestic ones'such as labor-intensive service industries'and higher value-added exporting ones. These reforms will need to be carefully calibrated and sequenced, and will take time to fully bear fruit'but they should not be put off simply because they are complicated. At the same time, they need to be complemented by other steps to boost consumption and worker's incomes. Three strands are needed: firstly, reducing the incentives for investment by putting in place fairer resource prices, interest rates, and distributing dividends from state-owned enterprises, secondly, boosting household incomes through higher wages and lower social security contributions, and thirdly, lowering precautionary savings by continuing to strengthen the social safety net and increase spending on pensions and healthcare. Achieving these will also call for structural changes to the fiscal relationship between the central and local governments, so as to enable social expenditure obligations and priority infrastructure needs to be met without local governments having to fund themselves through indirect borrowing and land sales. Together, these reforms have the potential to create a virtuous circle that generates long'lasting benefits. The transition will certainly not be an easy one, given China's size and increasing complexity. It will also involve accepting somewhat lower growth in the next few years as these measures are put in place. But the end result will be a stronger and more sustainable economic model, which sees the fruits of China's growth more equitably shared and allows it to remain a powerful engine of the global economy over the next decade and beyond.

Even J-Pop groups are recording paeans to the economic policy named after the newly-elected premier. It is clear that \"Abenomics\" has been a remarkable branding success. But will it equally be an economic triumph? [We think it can be, and initial signs are positive. But such success is not assured. It will require difficult decisions as the country moves into largely uncharted territory. And much will depend on changing expectations within the country. **Abenomics: Changing Minds** Following two decades of deflation, low growth and rising public debt, Japan is looking to make a clean break with its recent past. Prime Minister Abe rolled out, in late-2012 and early 2013, a comprehensive approach to reviving the Japanese economy, summarized by three policy arrows: aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms to raise potential growth. The idea is this: An escape from deflation triggered by monetary easing and fiscal stimulus would lower real interest rates and stimulate investment, consumption and'with, at least temporarily, a weaker yen'exports. Structural reforms would contribute to confidence and ensure that higher growth is sustained. Lower funding costs and higher growth would improve debt dynamics. And a credible medium-term fiscal plan would curtail risks of a government bond rate spike and allow for a measured pace of adjustment. If all goes according to plan, a more dynamic Japan would emerge, which would be an important plus for the global economy as well. What is being attempted under Abenomics is nothing less than a leap from a low-growth deflationary equilibrium to a new equilibrium characterized by positive inflation and higher sustained growth. This will require a parallel shift toward more risk-taking, requiring changes in expectations by businesses, consumers and financial institutions, both about Japan's growth prospects as well as the government's ability to carry through with needed reforms. These changes will not be easy to engineer. To put it in perspective, a Japanese college student today has experienced deflation and low growth through her entire life, with nominal GDP at the same level as 1991. **An End to Incrementalism?** In early April, the first of the three arrows was fired, with the Bank of Japan announcing its new quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQME) framework to achieve 2 percent inflation in a stable manner within about two years. The sheer size of the planned asset purchases marks a clear departure from the incremental approach of the past, and forward guidance is aimed squarely at sending the message that QQME will continue for as long as necessary to achieve its goals. We think this new framework has a good chance of success. But monetary policy cannot do the job alone-all three of Abe's arrows are required. The government recently put forward a broad growth agenda, but critical details remain to be fleshed out in the coming months. With the Upper House election now complete, all eyes will be on Tokyo to see whether the structural elements of Abenomics will also represent a decisive break from the past, by directing policies at the key underlying constraints to growth. Concrete steps to raise employment, increase labor market flexibility, deregulate agriculture and the services sector, and enhance the role of the financial sector in supporting growth, would be key. A clear and convincing plan to reverse the long-term trend of rising government debt is also needed urgently. Net public debt has increased from 13 percent in 1990 to 134 percent today, the highest among advanced economies. This rise in debt has so far been financed without problem. But the experience in the European periphery makes it clear that investors' views can change quickly, and that reducing the debt burden will require both medium-term adjustment and higher growth. Moving forward, as planned, with the consumption tax hike next April would be a major step in the right direction. **Is it Working?** We see encouraging signs that the desired changes to the economy are beginning to take place. Growth in the first quarter rose by an impressive 4\u00c2? percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate). Equity markets are up by some 40 percent for the year. Exports appear to be recovering. Credit growth has turned positive. Consumer and business confidence have picked up. And Inflation expectations are beginning to rise. Meanwhile, media reports abound with anecdotal evidence of recovery'it seems, for instance, that purchases of expensive tuna are now outstripping the more humble mackerel in sushi restaurants throughout Tokyo. But the transformation is far from complete. In particular, higher investment and wages'two keys for ultimate success'are not yet observed. This should not be surprising, as businesses will need first to feel secure that the economy is moving to higher growth, while financial institutions are still sorting out the implications of recent changes for their business models. This process is also behind much of the volatility we have witnessed in Japanese financial markets in recent months. Much can still go wrong. The global economy has been volatile and a downturn could create headwinds just as Japan's economy is taking off. But the bigger risk is domestic, that through complacency or political obstacles we get a partial version of Abenomics, missing one or more of its key elements and failing to convince that \"this time is different.\" But, for the first time in a while, there are good reasons for optimism in Japan.

But what a difference a year makes! As our latest [report on the U.S. economy points out, the housing market recovery has been stronger than expected, and is providing a significant boost to private domestic demand and economic growth. What has changed in the last 12 months? House prices have rebounded sharply and are currently about 7-12 percent above their level a year ago. Home sales increased by more than 15 percent over the same time period. Thanks to higher house prices and the positive effects of government housing finance programs, fewer homeowners are 'underwater'\u009d (owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth) or are behind on their mortgage payments, and fewer houses are entering foreclosure. **What is driving the recovery?** First, **highly accommodative monetary policy**, including Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage-backed securities, has set the stage for a revival of the housing market. Lower mortgage rates have increased mortgage refinancing, reducing monthly mortgage payments and therefore supporting private consumption, and encouraged home purchases. Lower returns on financial assets, such as long-term bonds, have also made real estate investment more attractive to investors. Second, **mortgage finance policies** (such as the [Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and the [Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)) have provided a further boost to refinancing and helped reduce the weight of the shadow inventory on home prices. For example, after an expansion of the program, HARP refinancing activity increased last year. Efforts are underway to enhance these programs, in particular to increase the public's awareness of them and to streamline the process of loan modifications. Other recent policy initiatives have aimed at strengthening mortgage underwriting standards, thus contributing to a more sustainable recovery. **Is the recovery sustainable?** The housing recovery is likely to continue. However, the speed of the recovery is difficult to predict and recent data has raised concerns about sustainability. The sharp increase in mortgage rates since May has raised concerns about a bump on the road to recovery, with higher rates potentially reducing demand for housing and dampening house price growth. There is little hard data to evaluate the impact on the housing market thus far'while mortgage refinancing activity has fallen sharply in the past few weeks, other recent housing indicators have remained relatively upbeat. However, mortgage rates remain close to their historical lows, and housing affordability is high, even after the recent increase in rates. Double-digit house price increases over the last few months have also caused concerns that the housing recovery is moving too fast and is headed toward a new bubble. These concerns seem premature. Despite recent increases, house prices nationally remain well below (about 20 percent by some measures) their pre-crisis level. While the price increases have been broad-based nationally, house prices have generally increased the most in regions where their decline had been the strongest, suggesting that prices are still catching up after the collapse. **Room for additional measures** While the housing market has come a long way over the last few years, it is not yet fully recovered and there is still room for policies to support the recovery. Highly accommodative monetary policy, and effective communication and careful timing of normalization of monetary policy can provide the right conditions for the recovery looking forward. As the economy recovers, the impact of higher mortgage interest rates on housing market activity and house prices is likely to be mitigated by the positive effects of a better economic outlook on confidence and credit conditions. Expeditiously completing regulations requiring banks to retain part of mortgage risk on their balance sheet and addressing remaining frictions in the housing market are a priority. While efforts are underway to gradually reduce the footprint of the government-sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac)'which currently account for nearly all issuance of mortgage- backed securities'there is scope for additional measures, including an early adoption of a fully articulated medium-term reform strategy for these enterprises.

The federal government budget deficit has fallen sharply in recent years'from almost 12 percent of GDP in 2009 to less than 7 percent in 2012. And [recent budget reports show that the deficit is shrinking faster than expected only a few months ago, to a projected 4\u00c2? percent of GDP for the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. Plus, health care cost growth has slowed down dramatically since the Great Recession, alleviating the pressure on public health care programs at least temporarily. Does this mean we can stop worrying? Not quite. Recent developments certainly mean that things are better than we thought just a few years ago and the fiscal adjustment needed to restore sustainability is smaller. But if the choice and timing of policy measures is not right, the deficit reduction may turn out to be too much in the short run'stunting the economic recovery'and not enough in the long run. So, in our [recent annual check-up of the U.S. economy, our advice is to slow the pace of fiscal adjustment this year'which would help sustain growth and job creation'but to speed up putting in place a medium-term road map to restore long-run fiscal sustainability. **Slow down'\u00a6 ** Around this time last year, we were worried that U.S. policymakers would allow a number of temporary tax cuts to fully expire and let significant across-the- board spending cuts (known as the 'sequester'\u009d) to kick in on January 1, 2013. The combined effect of these measures, dubbed the 'fiscal cliff,'\u009d could push the economy back into recession. Congress partly averted the fiscal cliff, with legislation passed just hours before the January 1 deadline: tax cuts were permanently extended for taxpayers below a certain income threshold, but the sequester was only delayed temporarily and allowed to take effect on March 1, 2013. Budget cuts under the sequester are coming at a time when the economic recovery is still fragile and they are also indiscriminate, affecting many vital services in education, science, and infrastructure. The sequester was intended to be so undesirable that policymakers would be forced to compromise and agree on more sensible options, but that did not happen. IMF estimates suggest that if the sequester did not happen, real GDP growth in 2013 would have been half a percentage point higher. **'\u00a6Yet hurry up** The silver lining is that the longer-run fiscal outlook today is not as intimidating as it was just a few years ago. [In 2010, the IMF projected an unsustainable trajectory for public debt'the federal government debt ratio could reach levels unseen since the Second World War (close to 100 percent of GDP). Since then, Congress passed several pieces of legislation'one of which led to the events that brought about the sequester. Today, the projections look markedly better (see chart). The federal debt in 2020 is now anticipated to be about 20 percentage points below what it was projected to be back in 2010. Despite the substantial improvement, the long-term outlook remains challenging. This is because of the impact of population aging, rapid growth in health care costs, and the anticipated increase in interest rates. Spending on Social Security and major health care programs, even considering the recent slowdown, is expected to increase by close to 2 percentage points of GDP over the next decade. A similar increase is projected for net interest outlays, as interest rates gradually normalize. Hence, with no further actions to raise revenues and reduce entitlement spending, the public debt ratio would start rising again'and this time, from a relatively high starting point. **What should be done?** The key priority for the United States is to implement a deficit reduction plan to curb the pressure that emerges around mid-decade, when the economic recovery is complete, interest rates return to historical norms, and demographic pressures kick in. This plan should: * **Protect the fragile recovery**'the bulk of deficit reduction should begin when the economy is firmly back on its feet and before the public debt ratio starts rising again. * **Entail lower growth in entitlement spending and higher revenues**'savings from entitlement reform accrue at a very gradual pace, so early legislative action is crucial to be able to reap the benefits later. Early action would also help contain the rise in long-term interest rates, thus promoting growth, and reduce the risk of turmoil in the Treasury market. * **Replace the sequester with better-targeted cuts and new revenues**'these automatic cuts fail to address the real problem (spending on entitlement programs), hurt growth in the short term, and could damage medium-term potential growth if the reductions in education, science, and infrastructure spending are maintained. **Easier said than done?** Considerable disagreements exist across the political spectrum on what a deficit reduction plan should look like'hence, the continuing lack of a comprehensive plan. Negotiations so far, however, have shown that there is common ground that can form the basis for a bipartisan blueprint. So, our message is: explore the options to replace the sequester and fine-tune the pace of fiscal adjustment so that no harm is done to economic growth, and enact laws today that will address the medium-term threats to fiscal sustainability.

But they also have a common denominator: a yearning for more equality in incomes, economic self-determination, and political power. Are these developments in seemingly unrelated emerging economies the beginning of a trend? Simple'some would say simplistic!'empirical evidence suggests that this may indeed be the case: look at the convergence of real per capita GDP in emerging markets to the level observed in Western Europe and the United States in the early sixties (see chart 1). One can conjecture that, once per capita income achieves this level, the rise of the middle class prompts demands for more equity in the distribution of economic and political power. We know the sixties. It was a time when the rise of the middle class led to a wave of social unrest and change that rocked the economy and society'a change that gradually spread throughout the western world (what we now call 'advanced economies'\u009d), with a call for more social justice, more democracy, and a better life for everyone. What followed were deep social and economic transformations. **Spending surge** What is perhaps less known is that, in most western countries, that call for more social justice and equality was matched, and partly satisfied by, a surge in public spending. Driven by the rise of the welfare state (particularly increased spending for pension and health care), the ratio between public spending and GDP increased by about 20 percentage points between the early 1960s and the early 1980s (essentially stabilizing since then, as shown in Chart 2). Importantly, how was this surge in spending that started in the early 1960s financed? Initially, governments could rely on increased revenues as growth continued to be strong. This lasted until the early 1970s, when deficit financing became the dominant mode, leading'to the extent printing money and inflation were not sufficient'to a surge in the public debt-to-GDP ratio that lasted throughout the early 1990s (Chart 3). Increases in tax rates'essentially an increased mobilization of internal resources'contained the eventual rise in deficit and debt. Nevertheless, the trend increase in debt in advanced economies was one of the reasons that limited the possibility of supporting economic activity in the aftermath of the 2008'09 crisis: given the state of public finances, governments had to exit early (some would say prematurely) from the supportive fiscal policy that had initially cushioned the effect of the financial crisis on the economy. **Will history repeat itself? ** In principle there is nothing wrong with a surge in public spending and a larger state. In many respects it reflects (changing) societal preferences. But, at a minimum, emerging markets would have to manage the surge carefully. It will not be an easy process as'and that is pretty sure'there will be strong pressure to finance the increased spending through increased debt accumulation. This, in turn, may raise vulnerabilities to an increase in interest rates and reduce the room for fiscal space should economies be hit by unforeseen shocks. In addition, there is a risk that once taxes reach a certain level they distort economic incentives and harm the underlying growth potential. Let's face it, we do not know what that point is exactly, and it is probably different across countries reflecting various economic and cultural factors. But there is no doubt that many advanced economies now feel the need to scale back public spending and taxation, which are seen as representing a severe constraint on growth. So, there are many things we do not know and we can only speculate about. But there is at least a distinct possibility that the 2010s will be for emerging economies what the 1960s were for advanced ones: a wonderful decade, but also one that involved major challenges from an economic, social, and (yes) fiscal standpoint. [ The average level of per capita income of emerging economies has now reached, in PPP real terms, approximately the level reached by advanced economies in the early sixties. [ The ratio between public spending and GDP increased by about 20 percentage points between the early 1960 and the early 1980s, essentially stabilizing since then [ Deficit financing in the 1970s led to a surge in the public debt-to-GDP ratio that lasted throughout the early 1990s ", "index": 418}, {"pub": "7/17/2013", "title": "Fixing the Financial Sector: A Change the UK Must Bank On", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6358", "content": " By [Krishna Srinivasan The UK economy is a long way from a strong and durable recovery. Growth has been flat for more than two years now, per capita income is about 7 percent below its pre-crisis peak, unemployment is elevated at 7.8 percent, with youth unemployment alarmingly high at 21 percent, and credit to the economy remains severely constrained. Recent data are, however, encouraging, and policies should capitalize on the nascent signs of recovery to secure strong growth and rebalance the economy. Fixing the financial sector, including by addressing banks' asset quality, is a pre-requisite for a durable UK recovery. _See the[ IMF's assessment of the UK economy_. **A multipronged approach** Fiscal consolidation has been a brake on growth, and policy should be aimed at offsetting the drag from planned near-term tightening, notably by bringing forward capital investment. Structural reforms, such as expanding vocational training, adopting new technologies and attracting qualified workers from abroad, should be accelerated to improve the economy's skills base and competitiveness. And monetary policy should remain accommodative. These policies will, however, need to be complemented by financial sector repair, which must proceed with a greater sense of urgency to normalize credit intermediation, improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, and ensure a durable exit from the crisis. To be clear, financial sector repair in the UK has advanced. Banks' funding costs have come down, as has their reliance on wholesale funding. Noncore deleveraging of bank balance sheets has progressed well, regulatory capital ratios have edged up, and profitability has improved recently, albeit modestly. **But this is not enough**. Significant questions remain about the quality of bank assets. The share of non-performing and delinquent loans is still high (estimated to average over 10 percent for Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), and Barclays), and lender forbearance remains a concern, adding to doubts about the health of banks. Net bank lending to households and firms has not picked up since June 2012, notwithstanding a sharp decline in bank funding costs since then. Moreover, credit to businesses has declined continuously since September 2008 (cumulatively by 12 percent). All this points to weak bank balance sheets and the inadequacy of capital buffers. These concerns are reinforced by the slowdown since 2009 in the build-up of provisions against expected losses, and of tangible capital buffers to meet unexpected losses, across major banks. Here, the US experience demonstrates well the benefits for credit markets and the economy of the early and comprehensive treatment of banks' asset quality problems. The US focused on the building of tangible capital (which, as a share of tangible assets, has risen by about twice as much since 2008 for major banks in the U.S. as for those in the UK), and credible stress tests, backed by supervisor-approved capital plans. Moreover, it shows that a vigorous capital-building effort can help break the vicious circle, where banks' health and their willingness to lend depend on the strength of economic recovery, which in turn depends on the extension of credit by banks. Indeed, credit recovery in the U.S. has been quite spectacular, with lending to businesses increasing by 30 percent since the trough in 2010. **Building bank capital** Any bank capital building effort in the UK should be robust, alleviate uncertainty and promote greater lending. Three steps are critical in this regard. _First_, it is important that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) ensure that individual financial institutions take the necessary measures to meet without delay the capital shortfalls identified by the Asset Quality Review (AQR). _Second_, given the AQR was not a stress test, and did not measure banks' resilience to shocks, the system-wide stress tests planned for 2014 need to cover a broad range of risks, employ sufficiently stringent scenarios, and aim for commensurately ambitious capital buffers. Transparency over methodology, results and supervisor-approved bank-by-bank capital plans would significantly enhance the credibility of the stress tests. _Third_, to boost lending, banks' capital building efforts, now and in the future, must be based on a combination of new equity issuance, reduction of dividend payments, restrained remuneration, and balance sheet restructuring that does not reduce net lending. **A strategy for the state-intervened banks** Going beyond this, a **clear strategy** is needed for the two state-intervened banks, RBS and LBG, with a view to returning them to good health and eventually to private ownership. Together, the two banks account for almost two-fifths of the stock of UK net lending to the non-financial private sector. These banks have, no doubt, made progress in repairing their balance sheets and improving profitability, but significant challenges remain, particularly in the case of RBS. Any strategy should seek to return the banks to private hands in a way that maximizes taxpayer value, safeguards financial stability, strengthens confidence and competition in the sector, and minimizes outward spillovers. In this context, a sovereign backstop'if required'should be provided to meet a capital shortfall, as it would result in a boost to growth far offsetting its cost.

Emerging markets are still growing rapidly. The US recovery is steady. And much of Europe continues to struggle. _** There is however a twist to the story. Growth almost everywhere is a bit weaker than we forecast in April, and the downward revision is particularly noticeable in emerging markets. After years of strong growth, the BRICS in particular are beginning to run into speed bumps. This means that the focus of policies will increasingly need to turn to boosting potential output growth or, in the case of China, to achieving more sustainable and balanced growth. **What the Numbers Show** Growth in **emerging market and developing economies** is forecast to be 5.0% in 2013. This is 0.3% less than in our April forecast. It is forecast to increase to 5.4% in 2014, but this is also a 0.3% downward revision relative to what we said in April. Looking specifically at the major emerging market economies: Growth in China is forecast to be 7.8% in 2013, a downward revision of 0.3%; growth in India is forecast to be 5.6%, down 0.2%; growth in Brazil is forecast to be 2.5%, down 0.5%; growth in Russia is forecast to be 2.5%, down 0.9%. In all four cases, we have also revised down our earlier forecasts for 2014, by similar or even larger amounts. **Turning to advanced countries, **growth in the United States is forecast to be 1.7% in 2013, a downward revision of 0.2%. But growth is expected to increase back to 2.7% in 2014. And we continue to predict negative growth in the **Euro** in 2013, at -0.6%, again a downward revision of 0.2%. This reflects not only large negative growth in Spain and Italy, but also low growth in the core countries. Growth in the Euro should turn positive in 2014, but will remain very low. The odd country out continues to be **Japan**. We forecast 2.0% growth for 2013, an upward revision of 0.5%, but only 1.2% for 2014, a downward revision of 0.3%. **The Story Behind these Numbers ** The slowdown in the **major emerging market economies** appears to have both cyclical and, more importantly, structural components: On the demand side, the slowdown in exports coming from low growth in advanced countries is playing a role, but in each case, domestic demand, be it consumption or investment, is also contributing to the slowdown. On the supply side, the slowdown hasn't been accompanied by much of a decrease in inflation. This, and other evidence, suggests that potential output has moved more or less in line with actual output. This has an important implication: Growth in emerging market economies will remain high, but may be substantially lower than it was before the crisis. The slowdown in the **United States** is not particularly worrisome, and hides a robust recovery in private demand. Stronger than expected'as well as stronger than desirable--fiscal consolidation has been only partly offset by a stronger housing market, and this explains our downward revision. If fiscal consolidation had been weaker, growth in the US would be substantially stronger. **Europe, and in particular the Euro zone, is still struggling**. In the southern Euro periphery, improvements in relative costs are leading to increases in export shares, but this is not enough to offset a very weak internal demand. High interest rates and fiscal consolidation are clearly playing a role. And unemployment levels remain unacceptably high. Even in the core countries, forecasts have been revised down. Lower exports, and induced low investment, are playing a major role in Germany.

The global economic crisis has reminded us, however, that we need to do more to ensure fiscal policymaking is based on reliable data on fiscal outcomes, credible forecasts of fiscal prospects, and a comprehensive assessment of fiscal risks. Working with civil society, governments, and others, the IMF has just presented a revised draft of its Fiscal Transparency Code, and we would like to know what you think of it so we can improve it further. You can [comment here. **An improving but incomplete picture of public finances** There is no doubt that the last two decades have witnessed important improvements in fiscal transparency. For example, until the early 1990s, the fiscal data of most countries covered only the central government's budget. Now, over 40 percent of countries report fiscal statistics for the whole of the general government: that is, both central and subnational governments. A decade ago, the vast majority of countries provided information only about the government's cash inflows and outflows. Now, about a third provide some accrual-based information (based on when claims arise, not when money changes hands), and nearly a quarter publish balance sheets of their financial assets and liabilities. Yet, as the recent crisis has demonstrated, the coverage, quality, timeliness, and relevance of published fiscal data remain inadequate. * First, information on fiscal outcomes is often unreliable, at least when first reported. For example, in Greece, but also elsewhere, reported pre-crisis debts and deficits turned out to be poor indicators of the underlying health of the public finances. * Second, budgets and fiscal forecasts often fail to provide credible information about fiscal prospects. Sometimes they are not even presented on the same basis as the fiscal accounts or statistics that will be used to judge the government's performance at the end of the year. * Third, few governments publish good information on the fiscal risks_ _they face, including the risks to public finances created by the financial sector. **A new draft Fiscal Transparency Code and Assessment** Our new draft of the Fiscal Transparency Code aims to address these issues. It sets demanding standards for the coverage, reliability, and timeliness of information on fiscal outcomes; requires budgets to provide a comprehensive overview of fiscal prospects and be comparable with fiscal accounts and statistics; and emphasizes the importance of analyzing, disclosing, and managing a wide range of fiscal risks, including those created by the financial sector. The revised Fiscal Transparency Code also provides the basis for a new Fiscal Transparency Assessment which replaces the old fiscal ROSC (Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes) and evaluates whether a country's fiscal data present a complete and reliable picture of its fiscal situation, outlook, and risks. These new Assessments improve on the old ROSCs by providing: * a more accessible summary of a country's strengths and weaknesses regarding fiscal transparency, * more quantitative assessment of the gaps in a country's reported fiscal data, and * a prioritized and sequenced set of recommendations for how to address a country's most pressing transparency issues. The new Assessments have now been piloted in three low-income, emerging, and advanced countries. Feedback from the countries has been positive and has helped us improve the draft Code. I hope you will have a look at our new draft Fiscal Transparency Code and give us your own feedback so we can improve the Code further.

However, [recent IMF research shows that fuel subsidies are both inefficient and inequitable, including in India. But what about India? Are fuel subsidies also anti-poor? Sadly, yes. A [new IMF working paper shows that India's fuel subsidies are both fiscally costly and socially regressive. **Rich benefit much more than the poor** At a global level, a major cross-country study by the IMF showed that fuel subsidies generally crowd out high priority public spending, like health, education and infrastructure. They also put pressure on current account deficits, distort productive investment toward energy-intensive sectors and technologies, and contribute to global warming. Fuel subsidies are the opposite of carbon taxes, after all. But the study also showed that fuel subsidies are regressive, meaning that they actually benefit the rich much more than the poor. Averaged across a large number of low-and middle-income countries, the study found that the top 20% of households capture six times more in benefits from fuel subsidies than the poorest 20%. Why? Because upper income households consume a lot more fuel products than poor ones, especially gasoline, which is the most regressive fuel product to subsidize. The image of a millionaire zooming by in his big SUV comes to mind. By contrast kerosene, which poor families are more likely to consume, is the least regressive product to subsidize. Recognizing that fuel subsidies were reaching the neighborhood of 2% of GDP, and crowding out more productive public spending, India's government has taken bold steps over the past nine months to reduce fuel subsidies. Diesel prices have systematically been rising, there are plans to cap the number of subsidized Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinders per household, and state electricity boards have been encouraged to set more cost-reflective power tariffs. These measures are welcome, as they also help to take pressure off the worsening current account deficit. But what less widely understood is that reducing fuel subsidies is a pro-poor measure. In per capita terms, the top 10% of Indian households spends more than 20 times as much on fuel as the poorest 10%. This includes both direct and indirect consumption ' the latter being when producers transport food to market, for example, using subsidized fuel. Low-income households consume mainly kerosene, while upper income households predominantly use petrol and LPG. Visualize a _crorepati (millionaire) _cruising by in his brand new SUV. What that means is that, if fuel products cost market prices, the top 20% of households would pay six times more for fuel, per person each month, than the poorest 20%. (See figure.) Put another way, the bottom 40% of families could be fully compensated for the move to market prices for less than a fifth of what government now spends on fuel subsidies, leaving significant savings to invest in roads, schools, and hospitals. [ Of course, the example above assumes no leakage of benefits, and that's a major challenge in India at this stage. But even if half of the efficiency gain were to be lost to leakage, fuel subsidy reform would still create a lot of fiscal space in India's budget for high priority spending. In this respect, the Indian government's plans to improve the targeting of fuel subsidies is particularly promising.

Sayeh Sub-Saharan Africa is the second fastest-growing region of the world today, trailing only developing Asia. This is remarkable compared to the current complicated state of the global economy, with Europe still struggling and the United States slowly on the mend. In 2012, Sub-Saharan Africa maintained solid growth, with output growth at 5 percent on average. The factors that have supported the region through the Great Recession'strong investment, favorable commodity prices, and generally prudent macroeconomic management'continued to be at play. **Within Africa, two speeds of growth** However, **performance varies across countries, and the region has seen growth at two different speeds**. Growth was very strong among oil-exporting and low- income countries. Exports such as oil, minerals, agricultural products, and tourism supported demand in these countries. Sectors that have been particularly dynamic include construction, agriculture, and mining (especially due to new extractive industry capacity coming on stream). In contrast, growth in middle-income countries slowed significantly in 2012, reflecting their closer ties to the euro area. South Africa was also adversely affected by labor unrest in the mining sector. Our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook _shows a broadly positive near future for the region, with a moderate acceleration of growth expected in 2013'14. This favorable prospect reflects in part the gradually improving outlook for the global economy. Domestically, investment in export-oriented sectors remains a key driver of growth. One-off factors will support growth in some countries, such as Nigeria's economy rebounding after floods, recovery of agriculture in regions previously affected by drought, and gradual normalization of activity in some post-conflict countries, such as C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire. Two-speed growth is expected to persist in the region for the next few years. Middle-income countries will continue to grapple with sluggish economic activity, with little room for policy stimulus, while we expect solid growth among oil exporters and low-income countries. We expect regional inflation to continue the downward trend begun in 2012, although a handful of countries, such as Malawi, will still probably see high inflation going forward. **Remaining risks** Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is subject to downside risks, originating from inside and outside the region. Medium-term risks for the global economy remain high, although the near-term risk outlook has improved. Among these outside factors, threats to sub-Saharan Africa include (i) a prolonged near-stagnation in the euro area and (ii) a slowdown in major emerging market economies. Risk scenario analysis conducted for the_ __Regional Economic Outlook_ indicates that these adverse shocks would affect sub-Saharan Africa's growth, but not derail it. That said, countries with limited policy buffers and a narrow export base could experience more severe adverse effects. Domestic risks include adverse climatic developments and internal conflicts. These events, though potentially severe in their impact on individual countries and their close neighbors, would not have significant effects on the region as a whole. **Policy challenges** The region's positive outlook is conditional on the implementation of sound economic policies. In particular, there is a strong case for strengthening policies in the short run in a number of countries to contain or prevent imbalances: * Sizable fiscal deficits in some countries, such as Ghana, point to the need for significant fiscal adjustments, although the pace of adjustment will need to take account of weak demand conditions in some cases. * Large fiscal expansion plans in some oil exporters, such as Angola, Chad, and the Republic of Congo, raise concerns over absorption capacity and cost effectiveness. * Continued higher interest rates set by the central bank are warranted in countries where inflation remains high and/or volatile, such as Ethiopia, Malawi, and Tanzania. * Surging current account deficits in some low-income and fragile countries, although largely financed by export-oriented foreign direct investment, require careful monitoring. In addition, with the risk of a significant global slowdown still present, rebuilding buffers to handle shocks from outside the region remains a priority in many fast-growing countries. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa could find it difficult to raise sufficient financing for larger deficits in the event of a downturn, although the majority of them are not constrained from borrowing by high debt as of now.** ** **Job creation top priority** Accelerating job creation and reducing unemployment is a pressing challenge across the region. Middle-income countries have seen high levels of visible unemployment, whereas robust output growth in low-income countries is not producing strong growth in wage employment. Policy recommendations to redress this situation depend on individual country characteristics, but would include the following: * Amending labor market regulations to reduce disincentives for hiring while maintaining worker protection; * Investing in education systems that deliver workers with the skill sets required by employers; * Revising hiring practices and compensation policies in the public sector to ensure an even playing field; and * Improving the business climate to boost employment demand. **Renewed interest of global investors** Recently, Sub-Saharan Africa's access to international sovereign bond markets has grown significantly, as we show in our analysis. This development reflects both easy global financial conditions and the region's favorable economic prospects. Zambia's debut Eurobond in September 2012 was massively oversubscribed and priced below Spain's 10-year bond at the time. Tanzania tapped global capital markets at end-February 2013, and just last month Rwanda did the same. Increasing access to global capital markets creates both opportunities and risks to sub-Saharan African economies. To make the most of the renewed global investor interest, we recommend countries maintain prudent fiscal policies that safeguard long-term sustainability; consider bond issues against a range of financing instruments under an appropriate medium-term debt management strategy; and follow best practices to get the best possible access terms. In this context, international sovereign bonds may not be the best option for financing infrastructure investment, because other funding options may provide more tailored and cost-effective financing.

What is behind this remarkable economic performance and will this growth be sustainable in the years ahead? Our[ recent study (see also our [working paper) looks at the supply-side drivers of growth for a large group of Latin American countries, to identify what's behind the recent strong output performance. **Supply side factors of growth** Increases in employment and the accumulation of capital, such as buildings and machinery, continue to be the main drivers of growth in Latin America. Together they explain 3\u00c2\u00be percentage points of annual GDP growth in 2003'12, compared with \u00c2\u00be percentage points explained by improvements in the efficiency of the inputs of production (labor and capital), what economists typically refer to as total factor productivity (Figure 1). Employment has grown vigorously in the last decade and many countries are enjoying historically low unemployment rates. Investment in physical capital has also risen steadily amid favorable external financial conditions and high commodity prices. [ While factor accumulation remains the main driver of growth, the recent pickup is mainly explained by higher total factor productivity (Figure 1). After exhibiting declines in most of the region in previous decades, total factor productivity is on the rise (Figure 2). This is a typical development observed during good economic times, such as the one the region is now experiencing'that is, changes in productivity are highly correlated with those of output. But improvements in total factor productivity also reflect some structural (permanent) factors, such as the movement of economic activity away from the informal sector in Latin America, as productivity tends to be higher in the formal sector. [ **Sustaining recent strong growth remains unlikely** Our analysis suggests that sustaining the recent high growth rates will be more challenging. While the region has, on average, grown at 4\u00c2? percent during 2003'12, our estimates suggest that the average potential GDP growth rate in 2013'17 is closer to 3\u00c2? percent. Indeed, the strong growth rates observed in recent years are higher than the potential GDP growth ranges in most countries (Figure 3). Potential output ranges vary significantly across countries. These often reflect differences in population aging trends, labor force participation rates, savings and investment in physical and human capital, natural resource endowments, productivity performance, and other country characteristics. [ Why do we expect output growth to slow down in the coming years? First, growth of physical capital is expected to moderate somewhat, as low global interest rates that facilitated large capital flows to the region start to rise and commodity prices stabilize. In addition, the contribution of labor will likely be limited in the coming years by some natural constraints, including population aging, limited scope for further increases in labor force participation rates (including for women), and currently record low unemployment rates that would hinder strong employment growth in the future. **Productivity growth plays pivotal role** So, the strong growth momentum in the region is unlikely to be sustainable unless capital accumulation surges (for instance, supported by rising savings, which are still very low in the region), human capital increases significantly (the quality of education has ample room for improvement), or total factor productivity performance improves significantly. Indeed, total factor productivity performance'despite its recent improvement'remains weak compared with emerging Asia, explaining most of the growth differential vis-\u00c3 -vis this region. Thus, fostering productivity growth remains a key challenge and priority for Latin America. The causes of low productivity growth in the region are many and varied, and designing a policy agenda to unleash it is a difficult task. Policymakers should aim at policies that help reduce distortions in the allocation of resources and this typically entails country-specific measures. Policies to be considered include: improving the business climate and enhancing competition; strengthening entry and exit regulation to facilitate the reallocation of resources to new and high-productivity sectors; improving infrastructure; promoting deeper and more efficient financial markets; enhancing research, development and innovation; and strengthening institutions to secure property rights and stamp out corruption.

And the accompanying improvements in public and external balance sheets have fed a sense that this time the macroeconomic response to the terms-of-trade boom has been different (and more prudent) than in past episodes. But, has it? In our[ recent work, we analyze the history of Latin America's terms-of-trade booms during 1970'2012 and quantify the associated income windfall (i.e., the extra income arising from improved terms-of-trade). We also document saving patterns during these episodes and assess the extent of the 'effort'\u009d to save the income windfall. Our findings suggest that, **although the additional income shock associated to the recent terms-of-trade boom is unprecedented in magnitude, the effort to save it has been lower than in past episodes.** **The recent terms-of-trade boom in historical perspective** A historical comparison of episodes of large terms-of-trade shocks'found only in the 1970s and the 2000s'shows that, while sizable, Latin America's recent boom has not been much larger than those seen in the 1970s (see Figure 1). However, it has been quite larger than in other regions, and only comparable to those experienced by the oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa region (see Working Paper for regional comparisons). [ At the same time, **the associated income windfall has been much larger in the recent episode than in the past** (see Figure 2), due to a higher degree of trade openness and a longer duration of the boom. Furthermore,** the effect of the recent boom has been quite sizable in absolute sense, with an increase in income close to 15 percent per year.** In other words, income has been 15 percent higher than what it would have been had no terms-of-trade shock occurred. [ Within the region, Bolivia, Chile, and Venezuela, stand out as having benefited the most, with increases of 30 percent per year for Venezuela and 20 percent for the other two. Again, these measures are only comparable to those seen in some Middle East countries. Brazil stands at the other extreme of the distribution, with significantly lower windfall estimates, while terms-of- trade changes in Mexico and Uruguay during the last decade do not qualify, under our definition, as booms. **Saving more of the income windfall this time?** A comparison of aggregate saving rates suggests that, compared to the past, the region's response to the recent boom has been more prudent. The median saving rate increased by about 4-5 percentage points of GDP, as opposed to 2-3 percentage points in past episodes. This has been accompanied by a remarkable increase in investment (about 5 percentage points), in clear contrast with the past, but leading to a gradual weakening of current account balances. Does this mean the region made a greater effort to save the windfall this time? Not necessarily. In fact,** estimates of marginal saving rates'a measure of the increase in saving as a proportion of the estimated windfall'suggest that commodity exporters have saved less of the windfall this time** (see Figure 3). Latin America's saving effort is also low compared with countries with a similar income windfall (the oil exporting countries in the Middle East). And efforts to save the windfall have gradually declined following the 2008'09 crisis. [ Also, a growing share of the windfall is being devoted to domestic (physical) capital formation rather than to improving countries' international asset position (via increasing saving abroad), which has affected post-boom real income differently in the past. This has resulted in a gradual weakening of current accounts. **Saving the extra does pay off** What can we learn from saving patterns during past boom episodes, in terms of their implications for post-boom income? A simple econometric exercise points to a high pay off from saving the windfall during the boom, in terms of raising post-boom income. More importantly, the composition of the windfall saving matters as allocating the extra income to foreign asset accumulation appears to deliver higher post-boom income than when invested domestically. Whether this reflects the benefits of having a stronger net foreign assets position or a cost of misallocating domestic resources during the boom remains an open question. What we do see is that this result seems to have been especially true for Latin America in the past. **Overall, these results suggest that the improved balance sheets in the region may reflect mainly the sheer size of the income windfall of the latest terms-of-trade boom, rather than a greater effort to save it**. And, with signs of further softening of saving rates and weakening external current account balances, a closer look into saving/investment patterns may be desirable.

In addition to the Group of Twenty advanced and emerging economies led global regulatory reforms, like Basel III, the United States and the United Kingdom have decided to directly impose limits on the scope of banks' businesses. The European Union is contemplating a similar move. We discussed these structural banking reforms a few weeks ago with officials from finance ministries, central banks, and supervisory authorities from around the world during the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings. **The design and implementation of these measures will have implications for global financial stability and sustainable growth, so we wanted to bring people together for the first global debate of the issue with G20 and other countries.** Our[ analysis suggests that structural constraints on banks' activities, well designed and implemented, can usefully complement traditional tools. **As a first best strategy, a targeted approach, where structural measures'such as 'living wills'\u009d'are tailored to the specific risk profiles of individual banks at a global, group-level would be preferable to an across-the-board approach.** However, sufficient confidence in supervisors' capacity to design and implement the targeted approach, along with strong political support, are key to the ultimate success of structural measures to reduce risks in the financial system. If this confidence is lacking then, as a second best, across-the-board measures, in addition to bank-specific measures, would be appropriate, provided their global benefits are assessed to match or exceed their costs. **A tandem tactic to reduce risk** The crisis has made many skeptical of the ability of traditional prudential tools, such as risk based capital requirements, to keep under control the risk transmitted to financial institutions and the system as a whole by trading and certain investment banking activities. The crisis has strengthened the argument for excluding these activities from banks and hence impeding their access to taxpayer-funded backstops enjoyed by deposit-taking financial institutions. The structural measures to reform banks such as the U.S. Volcker rule, the U.K.'s Vickers ring-fence, and the EU's Liikanen proposal, which would create functional separation of businesses, all reflect a deep sense of unease with the risk culture engendered by the assumption of trading and speculative investments by deposit taking banks. Looking back, however,** restrictions on proprietary trading or investments in private equity alone would not have prevented major bank failures such as Lehman Brothers.** Nor would reorganizing the bank into separate subsidiaries in each host and home country have facilitated its global, group-wide resolution. Legally, Lehman had a subsidiary structure, yet its resolution has been long and costly. Looking forward, structural constraints on banks can work in tandem with strengthened capital requirements to limit banks' excessive risk taking. Combining these prudential tools can make a banking group easier to resolve and attenuate the too-important-to-fail problem. For example, if the investment bank is systemically important, ring-fencing deposits and credit will not necessarily resolve the too-important-to-fail problem. The temptation to bail-out creditors of the non-ring-fenced businesses will still be present. This suggests the salience of combining structural measures with higher capital requirements on all the systemically important subsidiaries. Combining the requirement for higher capital (for the ring-fenced entity) and leverage ratio (for trading activities of the non-ring fenced entity) under each of the Vickers and Liikanen proposals would result in a more robust policy to counter too-important-to-fail. If successfully implemented, these structural measures would make banks and banking systems safer in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, which would have a positive effect on global financial stability. **Three things to think through** But our analysis also suggests these policies will exert global costs given that they will be imposed on internationally active and systemic financial institutions. This is due to a number of factors. **First**, structural measures will be challenging to implement. How are supervisors to consistently and correctly identify the intent behind bankers' trades? While difficult in practice, enhanced supervisory collaboration in banks' home and host countries is critical to the success of the Volcker rule. A broad restriction on banks' trading activities in these countries could end up inhibiting their ability to make markets and hedge risks, activities that are not restricted under the Volcker rule. This could have adverse implications on liquidity and costs in capital markets. **Second**, as authorities reduce banks' ability to take excessive risk through structural measures, they must recognize that such risks could migrate to other parts of the financial system, including shadow banking entities. Policymakers may need to judiciously enlarge the regulatory perimeter and enhance the monitoring of shadow banks and their interactions with regulated entities for structural measures to reduce'and not simply redistribute' systemic risk. **Third**, imposing constraints on banks' activities at a global level, and on group-wide risk management tools, could make banks more resolvable. But this would potentially come at a cost in terms of loss of diversification benefits and efficiencies in risk management. And these costs may be felt globally. **Our analysis highlights the need for a global cost-benefit exercise that would encompass the extra-territorial implications of structural measures**. The case for introducing these policies at the national or regional level would be strengthened by confirming whether their global benefits match or exceed their global costs, given the potential for the spillover of both benefits and costs to many countries and areas other than the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Subjecting a global institution to different structural measures in different jurisdictions could exert further pressure on consolidated supervision and cross-border resolution. **The more resources are taken up policing compliance with multiple rules, the less is available for monitoring risk, which could increase the cumulative costs of these national initiatives.** Our view is that, as a first best, a targeted approach, where structural measures'such as 'living wills'\u009d'are tailored to the specific risk profiles of individual banks at a global, group-level would be a more effective than an across-the-board approach. However, sufficient confidence in supervisors' capacity to design and implement the targeted approach, along with strong political support, are key to the ultimate success of structural measures to reduce risks in the financial system. If this confidence is lacking then, as a second best, across-the-board measures, in addition to bank-specific measures, would be appropriate, provided their global benefits are assessed to match or exceed their costs. **We suggest development of principles to evaluate the global implications of these measures**. These principles would facilitate corrections by policy makers and thus mitigate adverse implications. These principles may also be useful for future measures that may be contemplated by other jurisdictions.

This is discussed in the [first issue of a new series of analytical work on the region called _Regional Economic Issues_, which we launched at a joint IMF/Czech National Bank conference two weeks ago in Prague. [In the 1990s, there were very few foreign banks'state-owned banks were dominant. Many countries went through severe banking crises. When banking systems were opened to foreign investors, foreign ownership quickly became prevalent (Figure 1) and the incidence of banking crises dropped dramatically. And where they still occurred, they were the usually the result of failing domestic banks'not foreign-owned banks. [During the mid 2000s, though, foreign banks fueled and financed tremendous domestic demand booms which in many countries ended in busts. This was because foreign banks had access to large amounts of foreign funding (Figure 2)'mostly from their parent banks in Western Europe, who in turn were tapping wholesale funding markets'which they used to expand credit where demand was strongest and profits were highest. Countries in the region, with their bright growth prospects and relatively low credit penetration to start with, were attractive lending destintations. [The ensuing booms were extraordinary in many countries. When the global crisis hit in 2008, new parent funding dried up and much of the previous inflows reversed, triggering deep recessions. The larger were the inflows during the boom years, the larger have been the outflows since 2008 (Figure 3), and the sharper the economic contraction (Figure 4). [ Since late 2008, parent banks have been scaling back funding of their subsidiaries, who are increasingly relying on domestic deposit funding. Over time, this will help reduce boom-bust cycles, since retail deposits tend to be more stable. But the shift bears close watch to make sure it does not go too fast nor too far. How can policy makers help? [Establishing a banking union would facilitate home-host supervisory cooperation which, together with more coordinated use of macro prudential policies, would reduce the magnitude, and possibly also the likelihood, of future credit cycles. And tackling [nonperforming loans'which in many countries are still very high'and [developing local capital markets as an alternative source for investment finance would offset some of the headwinds to economic growth from less plentiful foreign funding.

It has become more responsive to economic conditions and thereby helped stabilize growth, especially during the global financial crisis. While these are important achievements, major challenges still lie ahead'as our latest [_Asia and Pacific Regional Economic Outlook_ points out. What are these key challenges? In a nutshell, fiscal policy can, and should do more to make Asia's growth sustainable and more inclusive. In the near term, budget consolidation has to proceed as the recovery takes hold to rebuild the fiscal space needed to respond to future output fluctuations. At the same time several emerging and low income economies need to create room for higher infrastructure and social spending to support long-term growth, reduce income inequality, and fight poverty. **The role of investment** Public investment and the promotion of public-private partnerships can help more fill the significant infrastructure gaps in some economies. For example, government investment remains relatively low in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, despite substantial infrastructure shortages. At the same time, fiscal risks in some countries, stemming from investment spending conducted outside of the general government budget and from public-private partnerships, need to be countered through enhanced public expenditure management and fiscal transparency. Public spending on education and health also needs to be scaled up to enhance human capital and living standards in most Asian emerging and low income economies. Indeed, in spite of still relatively poor health conditions, low education levels, and the surge in per capita income of the past decade, government expenditure on health and education has barely increased in Asian emerging and low-income countries since 2001, and remains about 4 percentage points of GDP lower than in peers in other regions. How can Asian governments make room for higher spending on infrastructure, education and health, while still maintaining or even strengthening fiscal space? **Spending differently and more efficiently** Spending differently and more efficiently can go a long way. In several Asian emerging economies and low-income countries, subsidies'which are often distortive and not well targeted to the poor' take up a higher share of total government expenditure than in peers in other regions. The average annual budget cost'which does not even fully capture the total fiscal burden' of energy and food subsidies is nearly 2 percent of GDP in Asian emerging and low-income countries. In a few cases, such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia, it is even higher. In Indonesia, at more than 4 percent of GDP, the direct fiscal cost of oil and food subsidies is close to total government spending on health and education. Energy subsidies, which create distortions and other economic costs, are damaging to the environment, and in practice, often benefit higher income groups more than the poor. Furthermore, the effectiveness of subsidy programs in the region is sometimes compromised by implementation problems, such as targeting errors, illegal diversions, and procurement inefficiencies. **Alleviating the impact on the poor** Any subsidy reform should include compensatory measures to alleviate the adverse impact of price increases on the poor, which could be substantial. Targeted cash transfers or vouchers can be effective instruments in this respect, provided data and administrative capacity are adequate. And indeed, some subsidy reforms along those lines are taking place. India, for instance, has initiated a wide-ranging project to shift many subsidy programs away from in'kind delivery toward direct cash transfers, and in parallel is enhancing the system to indentify eligible individuals. Finally, reforms are needed not just on the spending side but also on the tax side. Reducing complex and poorly targeted tax incentives and enhancing tax administration can create space for social and infrastructure spending. And a number of Asian economies could also consider making their current revenue structure more growth-friendly by making greater use of general consumption taxes and property taxes and reducing their reliance on corporate income taxation.

Many economies in the region are operating at or near potential, inflation remains generally low, and unemployment is at historically low levels. In the near term, the region will continue to benefit from easy external financing and relatively high commodity prices. In our May 2013_ _[_Regional Economic Outlook__,_ we project that the region will expand by about 3\u00c2? percent in 2013. In Brazil'the region's largest economy'economic activity is strengthening, driven by improving external demand, measures to boost investment, and the impact of earlier policy easing. In the rest of Latin America, output growth is expected to remain near potential. [Since 2003, Latin America has experienced a period of resurgence, with strong growth, low inflation, and improved social outcomes (see Chart 1). Prudent macroeconomic policies and important structural reforms have been the cornerstone of this performance. However, except for the period immediately following the 2008 global financial crisis, exceptionally benign external conditions also have been an important factor. Foreign financing has been cheap and abundant, and there has been a large and persistent increase in the prices of the region's commodity exports. However, even gold can lose its luster. These blissful external conditions will not last forever. Commodity prices are projected to stay flat or decline somewhat in the coming years, and interest rates will eventually rise as growth in the advanced economies returns. The key challenge for policymakers in the region is to adjust policies to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, and build strong foundations for sustained growth in the future, under possibly less favorable external conditions. In the rest of this piece, I will look at the way Latin America has managed the good times of the past decade, and discuss how it can best meet future challenges. **Managing the windfall** [The income windfall from persistently high commodity prices over the past decade has been unprecedented. The windfall averaged 15 percent of domestic income on an annual basis, and close to 90 percent on a cumulative basis (see Chart 2). This good fortune has spurred rapid growth and has made possible a substantial improvement in government and external balance sheets. However, efforts to save the windfall have eroded since the 2008 global crisis. In many countries, public debt at end-2012 remains above pre-crisis levels and fiscal balances are much weaker. Looking forward, it would be prudent to increase fiscal savings, so that the economies are in better shape to manage the likely fading of the external tailwinds. Fiscal consolidation will also help to alleviate pressures on capacity and help narrow the external current account deficits. **Higher capital inflows** [Easy monetary conditions in advanced economies and stronger fundamentals in the region have fueled large private capital inflows. Net capital flows to the financially integrated economies in Latin America have more than doubled from an average of below 2 percent of GDP during 2005'07 to about 4 percent in 2010'12, with the increase explained mainly by higher net portfolio flows (see Chart 3). Preventing these inflows from generating financial excesses remains a key policy challenge. Bank credit continues to grow at a relatively fast pace, and asset prices have increased significantly (including housing prices in key metropolitan areas). These developments call for tighter fiscal policy. In addition, exchange rate flexibility should be used to discourage speculative flows, while faster reserve accumulation could be considered in cases where currencies are on the strong side of the range consistent with fundamentals. Prudential measures, such as tighter loan-to-value ratios, higher capital requirements, and limits on sectoral exposure, could also be deployed to prevent a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. **Sustaining high growth** From a supply perspective, Latin America's growth over the last decade continued to be driven by increases in physical capital and labor. Productivity growth also picked up, contrary to the trends of past decades, but remains well below that recorded in other fast growing regions. During 2003'12, labor and capital accumulation contributed 3\u00c2\u00be percentage points to Latin America's annual GDP growth, while total factor productivity contributed around \u00c2\u00be percentage points. With labor participation at historically high levels and very low unemployment rates, future growth would have to rely increasingly on productivity gains. Boosting productivity is not an easy task and countries need to tailor measures to the circumstances of each country. Policies that would be conducive to this outcome include higher investment in infrastructure and human capital, more modern legal frameworks, and more efficient and competitive product and labor markets. In the near term, it would be important for policymakers to calibrate macroeconomic policies based on a realistic assessment of the supply potential of the economy. The key challenge for Latin America is to take advantage of the still favorable external conditions to anchor its progress in the last decade and lay the foundations for sustainable growth. This entails strengthening fiscal positions further, prudent management of capital flows to avoid financial excesses, and pressing ahead with structural reforms to increase productivity and potential growth.

Stiglitz Columbia University, New York, and co-host of the Conference on _Rethinking Macro Policy II: First Steps and Early Lessons_ ( In analyzing the most recent financial crisis, we can benefit somewhat from the misfortune of recent decades. The approximately 100 crises that have occurred during the last 30 years'as liberalization policies became dominant'have given us a wealth of experience and mountains of data. If we look over a 150 year period, we have an even richer data set. With a century and half of clear, detailed information on crisis after crisis, the burning question is not _How did this happen? _but _How did we ignore that long history, and think that we had solved the problems with the business cycle_?_ _Believing that we had made big economic fluctuations a thing of the past took a remarkable amount of hubris. **_Markets are not stable, efficient, or self-correcting_** The big lesson that this crisis forcibly brought home'one we should have long known'is that economies are not necessarily efficient, stable or self- correcting. There are two parts to this belated revelation. One is that standard models had focused on _exogenous_ shocks, and yet it's very clear that a very large fraction of the perturbations to our economy are _endogenou_s. There are not only short'run endogenous shocks; there are long'run structural transformations and persistent shocks. **The models that focused on exogenous shocks simply misled us'the majority of the really big shocks come from within the economy**. Secondly, **economies are not self-correcting**. It's clear that we have yet to fully take on aboard this crucial lesson that we should have learned from this crisis: even in its aftermath, the tepid attempts to fix the economies of the United States and Europe have been a failure. They certainly have not gone far enough. The result is that we continue to face significant risks of another crisis in the future. So too, the responses to the crisis have not brought our economies anywhere near back to full employment. The loss in GDP between our potential and our actual output is in the trillions of dollars. Of course, some will say that it could have been done worse, and that's true. Considering that the people in charge of fixing the crisis included some of the same ones who created it in the first place, it is perhaps remarkable it hasn't been a bigger catastrophe. **_More than deleveraging, more than a balance sheet crisis: the need for structural transformation_** In terms of human resources, capital stock, and natural resources, we're roughly at the same levels today that we were before the crisis. Meanwhile, **many countries have not regained their pre-crisis GDP levels,** to say nothing of a return to the pre-crisis growth paths. In a very fundamental sense, the crisis is still not fully resolved'and there's no good economic theory that explains why that should be the case. Some of this has to do with the issue of the slow pace of deleveraging. **But even as the economy deleverages, there is every reason to believe that it will not return to full employment.** We are not likely to return to the pre-crisis household savings rate of zero'nor would it be a good thing if we did. Even if manufacturing has a slight recovery, most of the jobs that have been lost in that sector will not be regained. Some have suggested that, looking at past data, we should resign ourselves to this unfortunate state of affairs. Economies that have had severe financial crises typically recover slowly. **But the fact that things have _often _gone badly in the aftermath of a financial crisis doesn't mean they _must_ go badly**. This is more than just a balance sheet crisis. There is a deeper cause: The United States and Europe are going through a structural transformation. There is a structural transformation associated with the move from manufacturing to a service sector economy. Additionally, changing comparative advantages requires massive adjustments in the structure of the North Atlantic countries. **_Reforms that are, at best, half-way measures_** Markets by themselves do not in general lead to efficient, stable and socially acceptable outcomes. This means we have to think a little bit more deeply about what kind of economic architectures will lead to growth, real stability, and a good distribution of income. There is an ongoing debate about whether we simply need to tweak the existing economic architecture or whether we need to make more fundamental changes. I have two concerns. One I hinted at earlier: ** the reforms undertaken so far have only tinkered at the edges**. The second is that some of the changes in our economic structure (both before and after the crisis) that were _supposed _to make the economy perform better may not have done so. There are some reforms, for instance, that may enable the economy to better withstand small shocks, but actually make it less able to absorb big shocks. This is true of much of the financial sector integration that may have allowed the economy to absorb some of the smaller shocks, but clearly made the economy less resilient to fatter'tail shocks. It should be clear that many of the \"improvements\" in markets before the crisis actually increased countries' exposure to risk. Whatever the benefits that might be derived from capital and financial market liberalization (and they are questionable), there have been severe costs in terms of increased risk. We ought to be [rethinking attitudes towards these reforms'and the IMF should be commended for its rethinking in recent years. One of the objectives of capital account management, in all of its forms, can be to reduce domestic volatility arising from a country's international engagements. More generally,** the crisis has brought home the importance of financial regulation for macroeconomic stability**. But as I assess what has happened since the crisis, I feel disappointed. With the mergers that have occurred in the aftermath of the crisis, the problem of too-big-to- fail banks has become even worse. But the problem is not just with too-big-to-fail banks. There are banks that are too intertwined to fail and banks that are too correlated to fail. We have done little about any of these issues. There has, of course, been a huge amount of discussion about too- big-to-fail. But being too correlated is a distinct issue. There is a strong need for a more diversified ecology of financial institutions that would reduce incentives to be excessively correlated and lead to greater stability. This is a perspective that has not been emphasized nearly enough. Also, we haven't done enough to increase bank capital requirements. Missing in much of the discussion is an assessment of the costs vs. benefits of higher capital requirements. We know the benefits'a lower risk of a government bailout and a recurrence of the kinds of events that marked 2007 and 2008. But on the cost side, we've paid too little attention to the fundamental insights of the Modigliani'Miller Theorem, which explains the bogusness of arguments that increasing capital requirements will increase the cost of capital. **_Deficiencies in reforms and in modeling_** If we had begun our reform efforts with a focus on how to make our economy more efficient and more stable, there are other questions we would have naturally asked; other questions we would have posed. Interestingly, there is some correspondence between these deficiencies in our reform efforts and the deficiencies in the models that we as economists often use in macroeconomics. _The importance of credit_ We would, for instance, have asked what the fundamental roles of the financial sector are, and how we can get it to perform those roles better. Clearly, one of the key roles is the allocation of capital and the provision of credit, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises, a function which it did not perform well before the crisis, and which arguably it is still not fulfilling well. This might seem obvious. **But a focus on the provision of credit has neither been at the center of policy discourse nor of the standard macro-models**. We have to shift our focus from money to credit. In any balance sheet, the two sides are usually going to be very highly correlated. But that is not always the case, particularly in the context of large economic perturbations. In these, we ought to be focusing on credit. I find it remarkable the extent to which there has been an inadequate examination in standard macro models of the nature of the credit mechanism. There is, of course, a large microeconomic literature on banking and credit, but for the most part, the insights of this literature has not been taken on board in standard macro-models. But failing to manage credit is not the only lacuna in our approach. **There is also a lack of understanding of different kinds of finance.** A major area in the analysis of risk in financial markets is the difference between debt and equity. And in standard macroeconomics, we have barely given this any attention. My book with Bruce Greenwald, _Towards a New Paradigm of Monetary Economics (_(Cambridge University Press, 2003) was an attempt to remedy this. _Stability_ As I have already noted, in the conventional models (and in the conventional wisdom) market economies were stable. And so it was perhaps not a surprise that fundamental questions about how to design _more _stable economic systems were seldom asked. We have already touched on several aspects of this: how to design economic systems that are less exposed to risk or that generate less volatility on their own. One of the necessary reforms, but one not emphasized enough, is the need for more automatic stabilizers and fewer automatic destabilizers'not only in the financial sector, but throughout the economy. For instance, the movement from defined benefit to defined contribution systems may have led to a less stable economy. Elsewhere, I have explained how risk sharing arrangements (especially if poorly designed) can actually lead to more systemic risk: the pre-crisis conventional wisdom that diversification essentially eliminates risk is just wrong. I've explored this is some detail in this [article, along with [this paper and [this one. _Distribution _ **Distribution matters as well**'distribution among individuals, between households and firms, among households, and among firms. Traditionally, macroeconomics focused on certain aggregates, such as the average ratio of leverage to GDP. But that and other average numbers often don't give a picture of the vulnerability of the economy. In the case of the financial crisis, such numbers didn't give us warning signs. Yet it was the fact that a large number of people at the bottom couldn't make their debt payments that should have tipped us off that something was wrong. Across the board, our models need to incorporate a greater understanding of heterogeneity and its implications for economic stability. **_Policy Frameworks_** Flawed models not only lead to flawed policies, but also to flawed policy frameworks. _Should monetary policy focus just on short term interest rates? _ In **monetary policy**, there is a tendency to think that the central bank should only intervene in the setting of the short-term interest rate. They believe \"one intervention\" is better than many. Since at least 80 years ago with the work of Ramsey we know that focusing on a single instrument is not generally the best approach. The advocates of the \"single intervention\" approach argue that it is best, because it least distorts the economy. Of course, the reason we have monetary policy in the first place'the reason why government acts to intervene in the economy'is that we don't believe that markets on their own will set the right short-term interest rate. If we did, we would just let free markets determine that interest rate. The odd thing is that while just about every central banker would agree we should intervene in the determination of that price, not everyone is so convinced that we should strategically intervene in others, even though we know from the general theory of taxation and the general theory of market intervention that intervening in just one price is not optimal. Once we shift the focus of our analysis to credit, and explicitly introduce risk into the analysis, we become aware that we need to use multiple instruments. Indeed, in general, we want to use all the instruments at our disposal. Monetary economists often draw a division between macro-prudential, micro-prudential, and conventional monetary policy instruments. In our book _Towards a New Paradigm in Monetary Economics, _Bruce Greenwald and I argue that this distinction is artificial. The government needs to draw upon all of these instruments, _in a coordinated way. _(I'll return to this point shortly.) Of course, we cannot \"correct\" every market failure. The very large ones, however'the macroeconomic failures'will always require our intervention. Bruce Greenwald and I have pointed out that markets are never Pareto efficient if information is imperfect, if there are asymmetries of information, or if risk markets are imperfect. And since these conditions are _always _satisfied, markets are never Pareto efficient. Recent research has highlighted the importance of these and other related constraints for macroeconomics'though again, the insights of this important work have yet to be adequately integrated either into mainstream macroeconomic models or into mainstream policy discussions. _Price versus quantitative interventions_ These theoretical insights also help us to understand why the old presumption among some economists that price interventions are preferable to quantity interventions is wrong. There are many circumstances in which quantity interventions lead to better economic performance. _Tinbergen _ A policy framework that has become popular in some circles argues that so long as there are as many instruments as there are objectives, the economic system is controllable, and the best way of managing the economy in such circumstances is to have an institution responsible for one target and one instrument. (In this view, central banks have one instrument'the interest rate'and one objective'inflation. We have already explained why limiting monetary policy to one instrument is wrong.) Drawing such a division may have advantages from an agency or bureaucratic perspective, but from the point of view of managing macroeconomic policy'focusing on growth, stability and distribution, in a world of uncertainty'it makes no sense. **There has to be coordination across all the issues and among all the instruments that are at our disposal**. There needs to be close coordination between monetary and fiscal policy. The natural equilibrium that would arise out of having different people controlling different instruments and focusing on different objectives is, in general, not anywhere near what is optimal in achieving overall societal objectives. Better coordination'and the use of more instruments'-can, for instance, enhance economic stability. **_Take this chance to revolutionize flawed models_** It should be clear that we could have done much more to prevent this crisis and to mitigate its effects. It should be clear too that we can do much more to prevent the next one. Still, through [this conference and others like it, we are at least beginning to clearly identify the really big market failures, the big macroeconomic externalities, and the best policy interventions for achieving high growth, greater stability, and a better distribution of income. To succeed, we must constantly remind ourselves that markets on their own are not going to solve these problems, and neither will a single intervention like short-term interest rates. Those facts have been proven time and again over the last century and a half. And as daunting as the economic problems we now face are, acknowledging this will allow us to take advantage of the** one big opportunity this period of economic trauma has afforded: namely, the chance to revolutionize our flawed models, and perhaps even exit from an interminable cycle of crises**.

One is intellectual: Are we asking provocative questions? Are interesting ideas being proposed? Are we talking about important issues? By that standard, the conference was very successful: the discussion was extremely stimulating, and I learned a great deal. The second perspective is practical: Where do we stand in terms of averting another financial and macroeconomic disaster? By that standard, unfortunately, I fear we are not doing nearly as well. As I will describe, my reading of the evidence is that the events of the past few years are not an aberration, but just the most extreme manifestation of a broader pattern. And the relatively modest changes of the type discussed at the conference, and that in some cases policymakers are putting into place, are helpful but unlikely to be enough to prevent future financial shocks from inflicting large economic harms. Thus, I believe we should be asking whether there are deeper reforms that might have a large effect on the size of the shocks emanating from the financial sector, or on the ability of the economy to withstand those shocks. But there has been relatively little serious consideration of ideas for such reforms, not just at this conference but in the broader academic and policy communities. **The financial sector as a continued source of shocks ** My view that we should think of financial shocks as closer to commonplace than to exceptional is based on history. Consider the United States over the past thirty or so years. By my count, there have been six distinct times over that period when financial developments posed important macroeconomic risks. In three of them, the risks were largely averted and the costs ended up being minor. In two, the costs were modest to moderate. And in one, the damage was enormous. **Concretely:** * In the throes of the Volcker disinflation, the combination of the severe recession and banks' exposure to Latin American debt caused many major banks to be in serious trouble. It was only a last-minute turn in policy and the willingness of regulators to ignore the banks' extremely shaky financial condition for a few years that kept the financial system from falling apart. So that was a danger averted. * The 1987 stock market crash was a significant financial shock, but rapid and highly visible responses by the Federal Reserve to keep markets functioning and reduce interest rates again prevented large damage to the economy. * The savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s did some damage to the economy through misallocation of investment and impaired lending, and somewhat more damage to the government budget through the direct costs of the bailout. * The Russian debt crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 caused central bankers some sleepless nights as they worried about the stability of the world financial system. Stability was preserved through the arranged rescue of LTCM, lower interest rates, and other actions. Thus, that is the third case where the danger was averted. * The dot-com bubble and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s caused a considerable misallocation of investment, and more importantly, a recession. * And, obviously, we had the housing-price collapse and financial meltdown of the past few years, which have had catastrophic effects. **Given that record for just one country over a third of a century, the idea that large financial shocks are rare, and that we therefore should not worry greatly about them, seems fundamentally wrong**. What I find striking about this list is not just its length, but its variety. And if you look outside the United States, it is easy to find examples of other kinds of financial shocks. You see Iceland and Cypress, where the financial shock came from a vastly expanded banking sector with huge foreign deposits. You see Greece, where the problem was disguised fiscal profligacy. You see the classic sudden stops. And I am sure that with a little more work, you could add even more types of financial shocks to the list. **In short, the range of potential financial shocks is long and varied**. There are only a few on my illustrative list of domestic and foreign financial shocks that took the form of big run-ups in asset prices followed by some kind of crash. Indeed, there are only two (the dot-com episode and the recent crisis) that ex post one could reasonably call bubbles. So I think the right conclusion to draw is that financial shocks are likely to be both frequent and hard to predict ' not just in their timing but in their form. **Small-scale solutions** **The question, then, is what to do**. Let me start with two small-scale policies, one of which I think is largely a nonstarter and one of which I think will be helpful but very far from a complete solution to the risks of future crises. The nonstarter is using the short-term policy rate as a tool for dealing with financial imbalances and financial risks. Even if that were the only objective we were using the policy rate for, it is much too crude. Often the concern is a potential problem in one part of financial markets, or different types of problems in different markets. In such situations, a single tool that affects all markets is of limited value. Indeed, as Janet Yellen pointed out in the discussion, often it is not even clear which direction you would want to move the policy rate to address a potential financial risk to the economy. And, of course, we want to use it for other very important purposes as well. So we can debate whether there is a little bit of benefit to taking financial developments more into account in the setting of interest rates, but at best it can improve things only marginally. **The type of small-scale policy that I think is more promising is the one we heard about in the sessions on macroprudential policies and capital account management**. The positive way to put it is that it is the wise central banker model; the negative way to say it is that it is the 'Whac-a-Mole'\u009d strategy. Regardless of how one labels it, the idea is to use regulations and interventions creatively to address potential problems as they develop. For example, if you think there is a bubble developing in the real estate market in Seoul, you adopt regulations directed specifically at mortgages in Seoul. **I was very impressed with the descriptions of policymakers' actions in such countries as Israel, South Korea, and Brazil in dealing with a wide range of financial developments, and one thing I learned from the conference is that such targeted actions are a useful addition to the policy toolkit**. But given the enormous range of potential financial shocks, the idea that we are going to stabilize the financial system by counting on very smart policymakers to perceive each problem as it is developing and design a specific intervention to target it quickly is surely wishful thinking. What I take from this is that we need to be thinking more broadly and creatively, looking for more fundamental solutions rather than particular interventions. At a general level, these can take two forms. **Deeper solutions on the financial side ** **The first approach is to reform the financial system so that the shocks that it sends to the real economy are much smaller**. The discussion of micro regulation showed that there are promising ideas in that area. Here I am thinking of stronger capital and liquidity requirements, special rules for institutions that create more systemic risk, and restrictions on the form or capabilities of what financial institutions can do, such as ring fencing in the United Kingdom and the Volcker rule in the United States. Those approaches are broader than responding to individual problems as they arise, and they all appear to be promising avenues. But at the end of the day, it is hard to believe that the relatively modest changes along these dimensions that were talked about at the conference are really big enough to give us a financial system that is so robust that it is not going to periodically cause severe problems. Shadow financial institutions may escape the rules altogether; rules can be gamed; and shocks can be so large that they overwhelm the moderate changes that were being discussed. Thus, I was disappointed to see little consideration of much larger financial reforms. **Let me give four examples of possible types of larger reforms**: * There were occasional mentions of **very large capital requirements**. For example, Allan Meltzer noted that at one time 25 percent capital for was common for banks. Should we be moving to such a system? * Amir Sufi and Adair Turner talked about the features of debt contracts that make them inherently prone to instability. Should we be working aggressively to promote **more indexation of debt contracts**, more equity-like contracts, and so on? * We can see the costs that the modern financial system has imposed on the real economy. It is not immediately clear that the benefits of the financial innovations of recent decades have been on a scale that warrants those costs. Thus, might **a much simpler, 1960s- or 1970s-style financial system** be better than what we have now? * The fact that shocks emanating from the financial system sometimes impose large costs on the rest of the economy implies that there are negative externalities to some types of financial activities or financial structures, which suggests the possibility of Pigovian taxes. So, **should there be substantial taxes on certain aspects of the financial system?** If so, what should be taxed ' debt, leverage, size, other indicators of systemic risk, a combination, or something else altogether? I do not know the answers to these questions, but it seems to me that they deserve serious analysis. Yet radical redesign of the financial system was largely missing from the conference. **Larger-scale solutions on the macroeconomic side ** The other way to make larger changes is to try to make the macroeconomy more resilient to financial shocks.** I thought the lack of discussion of possible changes in this dimension was the largest gap in the conference**. Let me discuss this issue in three areas of macro policy: measures to deal with shocks to a common currency area; monetary policy; and fiscal policy. With regard to a **common currency area**: imagine that at some point in the not-too-distant future, the eurozone is hit with another large financial shock that has asymmetric effects across different countries. Are things going to play out very differently than they have over the past few years? There would surely be fewer late-night meetings, because policymakers have learned more about how to do short-term crisis management. But I see little progress toward measures that would cause any fundamental changes in the effects the shock would have. **Policymakers have taken at most baby steps toward addressing the instabilities created by the fact that the responsibility for cleaning up insolvent banks is at the level of individual countries rather than of the eurozone as a whole**. And even less has been done in terms of a fiscal union and in terms of mechanisms to deal with large differences in competitiveness. Concerning **monetary policy**, inflation targeting appeared to be a wonderful framework for its first fifteen or twenty years. But we have now had an extended period where it has shown itself incapable of providing aggregate demand at the level that is widely recognized to have been needed. So it seems important to think about whether we should have a different framework for monetary policy. But again, progress has been minimal. The idea of targeting a nominal GDP path has been mentioned on and off for a few years, but the debate has not proceeded to serious quantitative analysis of its costs and benefits and of whether it could make the economy substantially more resilient. And other ideas for significant changes in the monetary policy framework have been discussed even less. With regard to fiscal policy, **I think the biggest idea that has achieved substantial support is that it would be desirable to have more fiscal space**. But how to get from here to there, given the challenges of just getting back to the amount of fiscal space we had before the crisis, is a hard issue, and one on which progress has been minimal. And given the terrible problems that have afflicted some countries that started the crisis with very responsible fiscal policies, fiscal space is clearly not a magic bullet. I heard virtually no discussion of larger changes to the fiscal framework. The possibility of measures to make automatic stabilizers stronger, for example through macroeconomic triggers for changes in fiscal policy, was not mentioned. And the status of this idea in the broader policy community resembles the status of targeting a nominal GDP path: the idea is mentioned from time to time, but has not proceeded to the point of concrete proposals and quantitative evaluation. Another fiscal idea that has received little attention either at the conference or in the broader policy debate is **the idea of fiscal rules or constraints**. For example, one can imagine some type of constitutional rule or independent agency (or a combination, with a constitutional rule enforced by an independent agency) that requires highly responsible fiscal policy in good times, and provides a mechanism for fiscal stimulus in a downturn that is credibly temporary. Roberto Perotti and Avinash Dixit raised the idea of fiscal rules or councils very briefly, but it got no further than that. The fact that we are making so little progress in terms of larger changes on the macro policy side appears to further strengthen the case for thinking about deeper financial reforms. But I also think we need broader thinking about the macro side. **Conclusion** After five years of catastrophic macroeconomic performance, 'first steps and early lessons'\u009d ' to quote the conference title ' is not what we should be aiming for. Rather, **we should be looking for solutions to the ongoing current crisis and strong measures to minimize the chances of anything similar happening again**. I worry that the reforms we are focusing on are too small to do that, and that what is needed is a more fundamental rethinking of the design of our financial system and of our frameworks for macroeconomic policy.

Akerlof** ****University of California, Berkeley Senior Resident Scholar at the IMF, and co-host of the Conference on _Rethinking Macro Policy II: First Steps and Early Lessons_ ( I learned a lot from the [conference , and I'm very thankful to all the speakers. Do I have an image of the whole thing? I don't know whether my image is going to help anybody at all, but my view is that it's as if a cat has climbed a huge tree. It's up there, and oh my God, we have this cat up there. The cat, of course, is this huge crisis. And everybody at the conference has been commenting about what we should do about this stupid cat and how do we get it down and what do we do. What I find so wonderful about this conference is all the speakers have their own respective image of the cat, and nobody has the same opinion. But then, occasionally, those opinions mesh. That's my image of what we have been accomplishing. I think this debate is very useful because each person's view of the cat comes from his or her perspective. And each of them is valid. My view of the cat is the poor thing is there in the tree; it's going to fall; and we don't know what to do. [ **So I'm going to give you my own thoughts on the crisis and how well we've been doing** **relative to the cat**. My thoughts are a slightly different angle on what everybody else has been saying rather pervasively from different vantage points. I am going to concentrate on the post-crisis United States, but the analysis also pertains internationally. There is an [excellent paper by Oscar Jorda, Morris Schularick and Alan Taylor. They divided up recessions into financial recessions and normal recessions for 14 advanced countries from 1870 to 2008. They looked at how GDP recovery varied in severity, according to credit outstanding relative to GDP in the preceding boom. And their conjecture was strongly confirmed. ** Not only are financial recessions deeper and slower in recovery than in normal recessions. They also have slower recovery the greater is the credit to GDP ratio.** **That is the history**. How do their findings reflect on the current crisis? Curiously, it depends upon the measurement of credit outstanding. With bank loans to the private sector as the measure of credit, the United States' recovery is about 1 percent of GDP better than mean recovery for financial recessions. When, in addition, the measure of credit also includes credit granted by the shadow banking system, we are about 4 percent better than the median recovery in financial recessions. The graphs in the paper I just mentioned illustrate this. **BUT**. With the onset of financial derivatives we have no way of knowing how to measure 'credit.'\u009d **If derivatives are used to hedge risk then we would expect derivatives to soften the crash**. For example if the buyer of a credit default swap goes bankrupt in the event of a default, rather than the seller, then we would expect the credit default swap to soften the crash. On the other hand, if we think that derivatives escalate gambling, then we would expect them to exacerbate the crash. The conventional interpretation of the 2007-2008 crash in the United States says that derivatives enhanced gambling in a different way. In parable, derivatives allowed a daisy chain of escalating valuation of mortgages, as they were made in the Central Valley on the shadiest of bases, but then passed through into derivative packages, which were rated A and higher. This was an environment in which junk did not affect ratings. So mortgage originators had no incentive to require downpayments or borrower credibility. To a great extent, they didn't. In their creation and ratings of derivatives the investment houses and the ratings agencies were mining their reputations as fiduciaries. **This additional role of the derivatives suggests that a measure of credit based on loans outstanding, even including the role of the shadow banks, yields a conservative measure of our benchmark for where we should now be.** That view also conforms with the common perceptions from the Fall of 2008. ** At that time the Great Depression was the benchmark for what would happen without government intervention. ** From that vantage point, macro policy has not just been good, but truly excellent. Alan Blinder's fantastic book, _After the Music Stopped, _says the exact same thing. Almost every program has been close to what the doctor called for. Those measures include: * The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 * The bailout of AIG * The rescue of WaMu, Wachovia and CountryWide by adoption * TARP * The stress tests run by Treasury and the Fed * Declines in interest rates to close to zero * The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 * Bailout of the auto industry * International co-operation in the spirit of Group of Twenty Meeting in Pittsburgh where the IMF played a leading role. **There is only one major criticism of the policies put in place. We should have led the public to understand that we should measure success not by the level of the current unemployment rate, but by a benchmark that takes into account the financial vulnerability that had been set in the previous boom. We economists have not done a good job of explaining that our macro-stability policies have been effective**. There is, of course, good reason why the public has a hard time listening. They have other things to do than to become macroeconomists and macroeconomic historians. But just a bit of common sense indicates why the policies have been so successful. If Lehman Brothers had been $1 in the red, and it needed to be only $1 in the black to stay out of bankruptcy court, then the expenditure of only $2, at just the right crisis moment, could have saved us from a Great Depression. That $2 finger in the dyke would have been all that was needed. **The expenditures for the bailout were of course more than $2; they will probably be positive, and run to a few billion dollars. But they did literally stop a financial meltdown which was in progress**. Relative to the tens of trillions of GDP that would have been lost with a repeat of the Great Depression, the savings from the Troubled Asset Relief Program are of the order of magnitude of 1,000 to one. 1,000 to one says that figuratively, it may be fair to call this a finger in the dyke. The expenditures by both the Bush and the Obama administrations on fiscal stimulus have had less bang-for-the-buck. But almost surely they have been effective. Current estimates of government expenditure multipliers are something like 2. That number also makes intuitive sense. Liquidity-trap estimates of a balanced budget multiplier are approximately 1, both in theory and in estimation; and the tax multiplier is robustly measured as approximately 1. And the government expenditure multipliers will be the sum of the two. So the stimulus bills have almost surely also had significant payoff. **In sum, we economists did very badly in predicting the crisis. But the economic policies post-crisis have been close to what a good sensible economist-doctor would have ordered**. Those policies have come directly from the Bush and Obama administrations, and from their appointees. They have also been supported by the Congress. **The lesson for the future is that good economics and common sense have worked well: we have had trial and success**. We must keep this in mind with policy going forward.

After two days of fascinating presentations and discussions, I am certain of one thing: this is unlikely to be our last conference on the subject. Rethinking and reforms are both taking place. But we still do not know the final destination, be it for the redefinition of monetary policy, or the contours of financial regulation, or the role of macroprudential tools. We have a general sense of direction, but we are largely navigating by sight. I shall take six examples, inspired by the conference. More thoughts are given in this [recent paper. 1\\. Navigating by sight. **Financial regulation.** There is no agreed vision of what the future financial architecture should look like, and by implication, no agreed vision of what the appropriate financial regulation should be. You may remember the famous quote by Paul Volcker that the only useful financial innovation of the last 40 years has been the ATM machine. This is surely an exaggeration. But we are still unsure about the right role of securitization, the right scope for derivatives, the role of markets versus banks, and the role of shadow banking versus banking. Still, we all agree that some things should change, and indeed policymakers are putting in place measures in the context of international or national initiatives. One example is the increase in required capital ratios. It may not be a panacea, but it surely can make the financial system more robust. Even so, however, I am struck by the level of uncertainty and disagreement about the effects of capital ratios on funding costs, and thus on lending. Reasonable people, such as Martin Hellwig and Anat Admati, argue that we are not so far from the Modigliani-Miller world, and banks can afford substantially higher capital ratios. Others, and not only bankers, argue that such ratios would instead destroy the banking industry. Another example is capital flows, and by implication, the role of capital controls. I was struck by [Helene Rey's presentation, where she showed how surprisingly meager the hard econometric evidence is on the benefits of portfolio flows. I was also struck by Stanley Fischer's rhetorical question: what is the usefulness of short term capital inflows? Clearly, how we think of the scope for capital controls depends very much on the answer to these basic questions. 2\\. Navigating by sight. **The role of the financial sector.** It has become clich\u00c3\u00a9 to say that macroeconomic thinking understated the role of financial factors in economic fluctuations. Much analytical work has taken place over the past five years to reintroduce the financial system in our models. But we are not there yet. For example, is there a credit and financial cycle, separate from the business cycle, as [Claudio Borio suggests? Or should we think of financial shocks as another source of disturbance, and the financial system as just another source of amplification? Was Stephan Gerlach right when he asked whether we should really reconsider all of macroeconomics for an event that may happen once every hundred years? Or, instead, are financial shocks and the financial system so central to macroeconomic fluctuations that the IS-LM model'which, as you will recall, does not include an explicit financial system'is not an acceptable port of entry into macroeconomics? By implication, there is no agreement on how or even whether to integrate financial stability and macro stability in the mandate of central banks. Does it require a tweak to inflation targeting, or much more radical rethinking? The intellectually pleasant position is to argue that macroprudential tools will take care of financial stability, so monetary policy can still focus on its usual business' inflation targeting. I read, perhaps unfairly, [Michael Woodford's discussion at this conference to suggest that the crisis should lead us to shift from inflation targeting to nominal income targeting, without a major emphasis on financial stability. I am skeptical that this is the right answer. I think we have to be realistic about the role that macroprudential tools can play, and that monetary policy cannot ignore financial stability. This brings me to my third point. 3\\. Navigating by sight. **Macroprudential tools.** At our first [_Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy_ conference in 2011, macroprudential tools were, to use Andrew Haldane's phrase, very much the new kid on the block. It was clear that the two standard tools, fiscal and monetary policy, were not the right ones to deal with financial imbalances and risks. The question then was: is macroprudential policy going to be the third leg of macroeconomic policy, or just a crutch to help the first two? We do not have the answer yet. But as more and more countries are using those tools, we are learning. I draw two lessons from the evidence, and from the presentations today. First, these tools work, but their effects are still hard to calibrate, and when used, they seem to have moderated rather than stopped unhealthy booms. This is also my reading from [Governor Kim's presentation. Second, by their nature, they affect specific sectors and specific groups, and raise political economy issues. This was clear from [Stanley Fischer's presentation on the use of loan-to-value ratios in Israel. 4\\. Navigating by sight. **Governance and allocation of tasks between microprudential, macroprudential, and monetary** policy **or, as Avinash Dixit has nicely called them, MIP, MAP, MOP.** How should microprudential and macroprudential regulation be coordinated? It is sometimes said that they are likely to conflict. Conceptually, I do not see why they should: I see macroprudential as simply taking into account systemic effects and the state of the economy in thinking about bank regulation and the situation of each financial institution. For example, I see macroprudential regulation requiring higher capital ratios from more systemically important banks, or for higher capital ratios when aggregate credit growth appears too high. The question is how to work out the division of labor and the interactions between the two, so that this indeed is what happens. If not done right, it might mean that, as a bust starts, the micro prudential supervisor ignores systemic aspects and other events, and asks for higher capital ratios, while the macroprudential supervisor rightly believes the opposite is needed. The United Kingdom's approach, with the creation of a Financial Stability Committee which can impose capital ratios that vary over time and across sectors, seems like a good way to proceed. You can read more about this in [Andrew Haldane's discussion of the issues. How macroprudential regulation and monetary policy should be combined raises more complex issues. There is little question that each one affects the other: monetary policy affects risk taking, and macroprudential tools affect aggregate demand. So policymakers need to coordinate. Given that monetary policy surely must stay with the central bank, this suggests putting both of them under one roof at the central bank. But this in turn raises the issue of central bank independence. It is one thing to give the bank independence with respect to the policy rate; it is another to let it set maximum loan-to-value ratios, and debt-to-income ratios. At some point, the issue of democratic deficit arises. Maybe the solution is not so hard, namely to give various degrees of independence to the central bank. [Stanley Fischer gave us a marvelous analogy, and pointed us toward the solution, when he said that anybody who is married easily understands the notion of various degrees of independence. Again, the United Kingdom's approach, with its two parallel committees within the central bank, one focusing on monetary policy, the other on financial policy with a limited set of macroprudential tools, not including for example loan-to-value ratios, seems like a reasonable approach. 5\\. Navigating by sight. **The sustainable level of debt.** The rate of fiscal consolidation depends, upon other things, on what we think a sustainable level of debt is. Many countries are going to be managing levels of debt close to 100 percent of GDP for many years to come. There is a standard list of textbook answers as to why high debt is costly, from lower capital accumulation to the need for higher, distortionary taxes. I suspect the costs are elsewhere. I see two main costs. The first is debt overhang. The higher the debt, the higher the probability of default, the higher the spread on government bonds, and the harder it is for the government to achieve debt sustainability. But the adverse effects do not stop there. Higher sovereign spreads affect private lending spreads, and in turn affect investment and consumption. Higher uncertainty about debt sustainability, and accordingly about future inflation and future taxation, affects all decisions. I am struck at how limited our understanding is of these channels. Reduced form regressions of growth on debt can take us only so far. The second related cost is the risk of multiple equilibria. At high levels of debt, there may well be two equilibria, a \"good equilibrium'' at which rates are low and debt is sustainable, and a \"bad equilibrium'' in which rates are high, and, as a result, the interest burden is higher, and, in turn, the probability of default is higher. When debt is very high, it may not take much of a change of heart by investors to move from the good to the bad equilibrium. I suspect that this is partly at work behind the Italian and the Spanish bond spreads. In this context, [Martin Wolf asked a provocative question: why are the spreads so much higher for Spain than for the United Kingdom? Debt and deficits are actually slightly lower in Spain than in the United Kingdom. No doubt, the overall economic situation of Spain is worse than in the United Kingdom's, but does this explain fully the difference in spreads? Could the answer lie in the difference in monetary policy? In the case of the United Kingdom, investors expect the Bank of England to intervene if needed to maintain the good equilibrium, whereas they believe the European Central Bank does not have the mandate to do? These are central questions, which we need to study more. 6\\. Navigating by sight. **Multiple equilibria and communication** In a world of multiple equilibria, announcements can matter a lot. Take for example the case of the Outright Monetary Transaction program announced by the European Central Bank. The announcement of the program can be interpreted as having removed one of the sources of multiple equilibria in the sovereign bond markets, namely redenomination risk'the danger that investors, assuming that a periphery country would leave the euro, ask in turn for a large premium, thereby forcing exit from the euro in the process. The announcement has succeeded, without the program actually having to be used. From this viewpoint, the recent announcement by the Bank of Japan that it intends to double the monetary base is even more interesting. What effect it will have on inflation depends very much on how Japanese households and firms change their inflation expectations. If they revise them up, this will affect their wage and price decisions, and lead to higher inflation'which is the desired outcome in the Japanese deflation context. But if they do not revise them, there is no reason to think that inflation will increase much. The motivation for this dramatic monetary expansion is thus largely to give a psychological shock, and shift perceptions and price dynamics. Will it work together with the other measures taken by the Japanese authorities? Let's hope so. But we are very far from the mechanical effects of monetary policy described in the textbooks. I could go on. Indeed, there were many contributions and insights from the conference that I have had to leave out. The conference has left us with a clear research agenda. We, at the IMF, fully intend to take up the challenge.

Perhaps because the region has been doing rather well, policymakers' concerns have increasingly shifted towards medium-term risks: could growth and fast convergence to living standards in advanced economies'come to an end? In fact, while the [economic performance of emerging economies in Asia remains undoubtedly strong in international comparison, it has already shown signs of gradual weakening. Both China and India have shown a declining growth trend since the global financial crisis: growth in China has slowed from a rate of over 10 percent in the 2000s to between 8 and 9 percent in the past two years, while growth in India has slowed from around 8 to 6 percent during the same period. **No trend slowdown in Asean-4 economies ** There has been no such trend slowdown in ASEAN-4 economies, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand, but there growth was lower to start with and'with the notable exception of the Philippines'remains significantly below pre-Asian crisis rates. So what are the risks of a sharper, sustained growth slowdown that would prevent emerging economies in Asia from rising to the high-income levels of advanced economies? Economic history tells us that as middle-income countries, they are _a priori_ more exposed than their low- or high-income counterparts. Over the past half century, the frequency of abrupt slowdowns lasting for at least a decade has been 1.5 times higher for the former than for the latter. In other words, there is some empirical support for the so-called middle income trap. But another lesson from economic history is that the middle-income trap can be avoided. In fact, Asia itself is showing us the way: Korea, Singapore, or Taiwan Province of China all graduated from middle income to high-income status in just a few decades. **Minimizing risks of sustained growth slowdown** How can policymakers in the region minimize risks of a sustained growth slowdown? Our recent research shows the following to be especially helpful: good infrastructure, sound economic institutions, open and diversified international trade, as well sound macroeconomic and macro-prudential policies that alleviate booms and busts, all help. And here is the good news for the middle-income Asian economies I mentioned earlier: on many of these dimensions, they often compare favorably to their counterparts from other regions. But they all have their weak spots. Compared to others in the region, India, the Philippines, and Thailand are exposed to a larger risk of growth slowdown stemming from subpar infrastructure. Improving economic institutions is a further challenge for India and the Philippines, as well as for China and Indonesia. China's relative risk factors also relate to its post-crisis increase in investment, while Malaysia's include its strong capital inflows'both of which have clearly supported growth but also involve potential vulnerabilities. **Demography's impact** A word on demography. Could emerging economies in Asia get old before they get rich? This issue would warrant another blog, but two points are worth noting. First, demographic trends are widely heterogeneous across the region. For instance, China, Thailand, and Vietnam will experience a rise in the so-called dependency ratio'the size of the young and old population relative to those of working age'over the next decade, but India and the Philippines will see a decline. Second, ageing will put a premium on reforms that mobilize untapped pools of labor, not least women, too many of whom remain under-employed or out of the labor force altogether across the region. Emerging Asia is doing well, but only through unremitting reforms will it be able to fulfill its promise.

But our latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ concludes that improved financial markets and gains in financial stability will not be sustained'and new risks are likely to emerge'unless policymakers address key underlying vulnerabilities. **There are two types: **'Old risks'\u009d, which are the legacy of the crisis, and 'new risks'\u009d coming from the easy monetary policies put in place to fight the crisis. **Old risks** **First, the euro area still needs to be fixed. ** * Despite the substantial improvements in market conditions, **credit **is not adequately flowing in the euro area periphery. * The corporate sector in periphery countries is also facing a sizeable debt overhang, which they built up before the crisis. * The report identifies a **weak tail of companies** that need to reduce their debt over time. The required debt reduction by these companies accounts** **for **a fifth of the total debt of periphery corporates in our sample**. This poses a challenge to their economies and financial stability.** ** **Second, we need healthy banks to support economic recovery. **But five years after the start of the crisis, banking systems around the world are still in different stages of repair.**** * We find that the process is largely completed in the United States, but remains unfinished in Europe. * Many banks in euro area periphery countries still need to make further progress in strengthening their balance sheets. And important banks in the core are still too dependent on wholesale funding markets. * At the same time, the global financial regulatory reform agenda is incomplete, creating regulatory uncertainty. This leaves banks less willing to lend. **New risks**** ** The easy monetary policies in advanced economies have been essential to support the economy. But their use over a prolonged period may cause side effects, such as excessive risk taking and leverage, and asset bubbles. **Do we see evidence that those risks are growing?** * **In the United States**, corporate debt underwriting standards are weakening rapidly'even though corporate fundamentals are strong, and leverage is in line with typical historical patterns. Also, continued low interest rates are leading some pension funds and insurance companies to take further risks to close their widening funding gaps. * **Second, easy money in advanced economies is spilling over to emerging markets**.

Emerging market and developing economies are still going strong, but in advanced economies, there appears to be a growing bifurcation between the United States on the one hand, and the Euro area on the other. This is reflected in [our forecasts. Growth in emerging market and developing economies is forecast to reach 5.3% in 2013, and 5.7% in 2014. Growth in the United States is forecast to be 1.9% in 2013, and 3.0% in 2014. In contrast, growth in the Euro area is forecast to be -0.3% in 2013, and only 1.1% in 2014. The growth figure for the **United States** for 2013 may not seem that high, and it is indeed insufficient to make a large dent in the still high unemployment rate. But it comes in the face of a very strong, I would even say overly strong, fiscal consolidation of about 1.8% of GDP. Underlying private demand is actually strong, spurred in part by the anticipation of low policy rates under the Fed's \"forward guidance'', improving banking conditions, and pent up demand for housing and for durables. The forecast for negative growth in the euro area reflects not only weaknesses in periphery countries, but also some weaknesses in the core. **Germany's** growth is strengthening, although it is still forecast to be only 0.6% in 2013. France's growth is forecast to be slightly negative in 2013, reflecting a combination of fiscal consolidation, poor export performance, and low confidence. Low growth in the euro core is bad news on its own, and bad news for the euro area periphery countries. We expect most euro area periphery countries, notably **Italy and Spain**, to have substantial contractions in 2013. The process of internal devaluation is slowly and painfully taking place, and most of these countries are slowly becoming more competitive. However, external demand is just not strong enough to compensate for weak internal demand. Adverse feedback loops between weak banks, weak sovereigns, low activity, and, increasingly, low confidence, are still reinforcing each other. **Japan** is forging a path of its own; it may have been more accurate to talk about a three and a half rather than a three speed recovery. After many years of deflation, and little or no growth, the new government has announced a new policy, based on aggressive quantitative easing, a positive inflation target, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. This policy will boost growth in the short run, and this is reflected in our forecast of 1.4% growth for 2013. Given the very high level of public debt however, embarking on a fiscal stimulus in the absence of a medium run fiscal consolidation plan is risky; it increases the probability that investors require a risk premium, and that this leads in turn to debt unsustainability. In view of this mixed picture in advanced economies, emerging market countries are, in general, doing well. We forecast **China** to grow at 8.0% in 2013, although this forecast was made before yesterday's numbers were announced, and we are still analyzing these numbers, **India** at 5.7%, and** Brazil** at 3.0%'in all three cases, higher growth rates than in 2012. In the past, the conditions that prevail today, from high commodity prices, to low interest rates, to large capital inflows, often would have led to credit booms and overheating. So far, policymakers have generally succeeded in keeping aggregate demand in line with potential. At the same time, potential growth itself has declined in a number of emerging economies, and we shall not see again some of the high growth rates of the past. **Turning to policies:** In the **United States**, the focus should be on defining the right path of fiscal consolidation'reducing government debt and deficits. While the sequester has decreased worries about debt sustainability, it is the wrong way to proceed. There should be both less and better fiscal consolidation now, and a commitment to more fiscal consolidation in the future. In the **euro area**, institutional progress has been made over the past year, in particular on a road map for a banking union. The Outright Monetary Transaction program offered by the **European Central Bank**, as yet untested, has reduced tail risks. But this is not enough. The interest rates facing borrowers in periphery countries are still too high to secure the recovery, and there is a need for further and urgent measures to strengthen banks, without weakening the sovereigns. The weakness of private demand also suggests that countries that have scope to do so should allow automatic stabilizers to operate, and in some countries with fiscal space, should go even beyond this and reconsider the speed of fiscal adjustment. **Emerging market countries face different challenges**, in particular the handling of capital flows. Fundamentally attractive prospects in emerging market countries, together with low interest rates in advanced economies, are likely to lead to continuing net capital inflows and exchange rate pressure in many emerging market countries. This is a fundamentally desirable process, and part of the global rebalancing which must take place if the world economy is to return to health. At the same time, as we have seen, capital flows can be volatile, making economic management more difficult. The challenge for recipient countries is to accommodate the underlying trends, while reducing the volatility of the flows when they threaten economic or financial stability. In short, recent good news about the United States has come with renewed worries about the euro area. Given the strong interconnections between countries,** an uneven recovery is also a dangerous one. In some ways, the world economy is as weak as its weakest link.** While some tail risks have decreased, it is not time for policy makers to relax.

These high debt levels expose countries to a loss of market confidence and, ultimately, damage long- term growth prospects. Since 2010 advanced economies have been on a journey: the goal is to bring their public finances back to safer territory. They are in it for the long haul, not a sprint, and, as a redress of the large fiscal imbalances created by the crisis, without derailing the still fragile economic recovery, it requires a steady and gradual pace of adjustment'at least for countries not subject to market pressures. This year [we see the process of gradual fiscal adjustment reaching two symbolic milestones. First, the average deficit of advanced economies as a share of GDP will fall to half of its 2009 level at the peak of the crisis. Second, the average debt ratio will stop rising, after increasing steadily since 2007. Indeed, it will actually decline slightly. **An uphill climb** Of course, at over 4\u00c2? percent of GDP the average deficit is still high, and stabilizing the public debt-to-GDP ratio, on average, at some 110 percent of GDP may not seem like much of an achievement. But these achievements should not be underestimated. First, this result occurred despite countries experiencing extended slow growth. The lower growth obscures some of the impact of fiscal adjustment on the budget, as cyclical factors temporarily inflate deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios. Second, halving the deficit does not mean reaching the halfway point of the journey. In fact, most advanced economies are past that point, as the endpoint for most of them is not a balanced budget. Those that already have a fairly low debt level can do just fine with small deficits in the medium term. Reaching the current milestone has not been easy: we cannot deny that fiscal adjustment has slowed the economic recovery and growth, and contributed to keeping unemployment rates at high levels. Indeed these adjustment hardships have taken a toll on many, and fatigue is emerging in some countries. Leaving aside a few relatively small countries, fiscal imbalances remain large in ten countries: the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and seven euro ", "index": 438}, {"pub": "4/11/2013", "title": "How To Make A Graceful Exit: The Potential Perils of Ending Extraordinary Central Bank Policies", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6148", "content": " **By [Erik Oppers ** This spring monetary policy is the talk of the town. It is everywhere you look, it's unique, and you've never seen anything quite like it before: short- term interest rates at zero for several years running, and central bank balance sheets swelling with government bonds and other assets in the euro area Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But the meteoric rise of this once dusty topic can't last. The end of these unconventional monetary policies will come and may pose threats to financial stability because of the length and breadth of their unprecedented reign. Policymakers should be alert to the risks and take gradual and predictable measures to address them. **The risk of a rapid rise in interest rates** Our new analysis in the latest [_Global Financial Stability Report_ looks at the consequences for financial stability of recent central bank policies, and also touches on the issue of how to end them and return to normal policies. The economic objectives of central banks, like low and stable inflation and'for some'low unemployment, as well as market conditions will guide this so-called exit. Market conditions are important. The main risks of an exit are associated with an unexpected or more-rapid-than-expected rise in interest rates, especially longer-term interest rates. Exit will mean that central banks start increasing interest rates, and they may also decide to sell some of the bonds they bought during the crisis. If private investors'fearing bond price declines from these central bank exit policies' respond by selling bonds en masse, this could lead to a spike in interest rates. Such a spike could have adverse consequences: * Banks and other financial institutions'including even central banks'would incur capital losses on fixed-rate assets such as bonds. While a rise in interest rates can be good for banks in that it tends to increase net interest margins (their main source of profits), it also leads to immediate losses on bonds. Because these losses are immediate and higher profits take a while to materialize, in the short run, weakly capitalized banks could suffer. This risk makes it very important that any necessary bank restructuring and recapitalization is completed as soon as possible. * Credit risk for banks may increase. Higher interest rates make it harder for bank customers to pay back their loans, especially if the rise is in response to an inflation threat rather than improved economic circumstances. * Spillover effects to emerging markets. Shifting expectations of the path of future interest rates can lead to sudden and potentially disruptive financial flows between markets and countries, especially if the timing of tightening differs across the central banks. **The downside of selling off your assets** There are also risks associated with efforts by central banks to shrink their balance sheets. While an outright sale of assets purchased by central banks in large quantities over the past several years may not be necessary to tighten monetary policy, whether sales materialize will depend on a number of factors. Central banks may use other instruments to drain liquidity; but there may be pressures'for example, political'to sell these assets anyway. These sales could also have adverse consequences: * Uncertainty about the necessity or willingness of central banks to sell their large portfolios of government bonds and other assets could lead financial markets to overreact when central banks begin to sell these assets. Fears that central bank sales could lead to falling bond prices may prompt private investors to dump bonds, which could lead to the previously mentioned sharp increases in interest rates. * Policy missteps could disrupt markets. If central banks sell assets before policymakers address underlying market vulnerabilities, the market dysfunction we saw during the crisis could resurface. This risk is heightened in markets where central banks hold a large share of outstanding issues or played an important market-making role, especially if underlying market dysfunction is now masked by central bank intervention. * Banks could face funding challenges. As central banks drain excess reserves to make monetary policy implementation more effective, some of the banks that will need to turn to the interbank market for funding will find the transition challenging. **How to make a graceful exit** What can policymakers do to prevent these risks from posing a serious threat to financial stability? Most importantly, the eventual changes in policy should as much as possible be gradual and predictable. A more normal policy environment implies'at a minimum'substantial increases in interest rates, and given the prolonged period of very low rates such a substantial increase will require more adjustment in markets, companies and financial institutions. A gradual and predictable exit would facilitate that adjustment. So central banks should carefully plan and communicate their exit strategies well in advance to markets, financial institutions, and other central banks to minimize the potential for disruption. Bank supervisors should ensure that banks repair their balance sheets and generally get their proverbial house in order while these unprecedented policies are still in place, so they can thrive once central banks decide to exit from their extraordinary policies.

That's right. 'Keep calm and carry on' was replaced by 'Keep them guessing.' The Turkish economy was overheating. Money poured into the country from foreign investors attracted by a strong economy and high yields. A lending boom resulted in excessive growth along with an appreciating exchange rate and widening current account deficit. While evidence of success, these kinds of capital inflows are a headache policymakers would rather avoid, as they expose a country to risks that affect the economy and financial system as a whole, while undermining the objective of controlling inflation. Turkey's unorthodox approach to this problem earned central bank governor Erdem Ba\u00c5?\u00c3\u00a7i the 2013 'Banker of the Year'\u009d award from the Financial Times' _The Banker_ magazine. Although it is too soon to judge the benefits and drawbacks of Turkey's approach, there are a number of lessons about the world of monetary policy in the wake of the global crisis for both advanced and emerging economies. In particular, a lack of policy coordination and clear communication can undermine the success of any approach. **Act I: Keep them guessing** Although targeting inflation, in 2010 the Turkish central bank became increasingly vocal about dangers to financial stability. In the absence of a timely response from the banking supervisor, it started to employ less traditional tools with an explicit purpose of addressing both price and financial stability concerns. A cornerstone of the strategy was using policies that created uncertainty. In October 2010, the central bank sharply lowered the overnight borrowing rate, at which banks deposit money at the central bank, while keeping the overnight lending rate, at which the central bank lends money to banks, unchanged. By varying the volume of liquidity provided to the markets through repo auctions, which are essentially short-term collateralized loans, it started to generate a lot of volatility in the overnight interbank rate within this widened interest rate corridor (Chart 1). [ The corridor, formed by the two overnight rates, became a signaling device for investors. Previously, the overnight interbank rates were kept close to the policy rate at which the central bank provides liquidity through quantity repo auctions, indicating the potential rate-of-return for a foreign investor. As the corridor widened, the volatility of the market rates increased. While on average the market rates continued to be close to the policy rate, now it was the 'floor'\u009d of the corridor that signaled to investors a guaranteed rate-of- return. Lowering it, it was hoped, would deter speculative inflows. Meanwhile, to directly impact lending to the economy, the central bank opted to rely on the required reserve ratios. These are portions of deposits that banks attract and by regulation cannot lend out. Besides being a monetary policy instrument, the required reserves also served a macroprudential purpose, lowering systemic risks from excessive credit growth. The central bank stopped remunerating the reserves, increased the ratios, and differentiated them by maturity, making reliance on short-term funding more expensive. However, it was not until the second half of 2011 that lending started to slow down: in June, the banking supervisor introduced macroprudential measures that made consumer loans costlier; the central bank publicly expressed its preference for a 25 percent credit growth; and, finally, external conditions started to worsen. **Act II: The pivot to progress** Even though Turkey's credit growth decelerated, the central bank had to significantly alter its approach to monetary policy in late 2011 when capital inflows weakened. This caused the lira to depreciate beyond original intentions, bringing inflation to 10.4 percent, while the current account deficit still rose to 10 percent of GDP, the second highest in the world in dollar terms. By late December, the central bank increased both the overnight and lending rates, switched to selling its foreign exchange reserves, and lowered the required reserve ratios. At that time, it felt it needed more flexibility given the crisis in Europe and the uncertain outlook for both the Turkish and the global economy. So it began to provide liquidity to the markets through different repo facilities: the quantity auctions at the policy interest rate and the price auctions with interest rates determined by the market. Varying the amounts of liquidity provided through these facilities allowed the central bank to change the cost of lending to banks literally on a daily basis, tightening whenever conditions required and loosening when the domestic economy needed support (Chart 1). Once again these policies created uncertainty, this time for local banks. The central bank also stopped its foreign exchange market operations as investors started to perceive it as overreaching its mandate by aiming at certain levels of the exchange rate. Instead, it allowed banks to convert part of their required reserves on lira liabilities into foreign exchange and gold. The goal of this'not yet fully tested'facility, the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM), is to allow market forces to determine the exchange rate while mitigating pressures from volatile capital flows. In 2012 Turkey secured a soft landing: the economy grew 2.2 percent, the current account deficit narrowed by some 4 percentage points of GDP, and inflation ended up at 6.2 percent. This is in sharp contrast with the downturns in 2001 and 2009 when sizeable adjustments in the current account deficit were accompanied by significant declines in the country's economic output. But the jury is still out on just how much of this success was due to the country's complex monetary policy framework. **Live and learn** Turkey's experiment offers a few important lessons: **Policy coordination is crucial for success**. The banking supervisor could have employed macroprudential measures sooner than June 2011, reducing financial risks that affect the economy. [This would have reduced the pressure on the central bank, which was fighting battles alone on several fronts, allowing it to concentrate on what it could do best'control inflation. **Complex approaches come at a cost and results are difficult to predict**. With too many objectives and tools, and in absence of clear messages, market participants got confused about the ultimate goal of the policies. [This weakened the transmission of monetary policy to inflation expectations and market interest rates. Contrary to expectations, uncertainty in the overnight interbank rates did not lead to a decline in other yields as hoped (Chart 2). [ **It is the amount of liquidity that matters, not how it is provided by the central bank**. The central bank employed various tools for different purposes, but in the end, inflation rose and the currency weakened when the cumulative injection of liquidity peaked. Likewise, the currency stabilized and inflation started to decrease only when liquidity was tightened (Chart 3). [ In 2012, after almost two decades, Turkey received an investment grade from Fitch, a vote of confidence by financial markets. The ability of the country's policymakers to navigate the economy to a soft landing was an important factor. But the path was not smooth, and it offers an important lesson: lack of coordination and clear communication can undermine the success of any approach, no matter how thoroughly thought through.

They have relatively higher costs, higher public spending needs, and more volatile economies. And their growth has not matched the improved economic performance of the rest of the world since the late 1990s, despite their many efforts over the years. We wanted a better grasp of why this is so we can better tailor our advice and support. Here is what we found. **Small can be complicated** More than a fifth of IMF members are countries with populations of under 1.5 million. Three out of four [small states are islands or widely dispersed multi-island states; others are landlocked, and some are located far from major markets. These small states are a diverse group representing all income categories, but all of them face size-related constraints. The smallest of these, known as microstates, have populations below 200,000 and face a fairly unique and at times more difficult economic circumstances. The Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, for example, has a land area of 10 square miles, roughly one-seventh the size of Washington, D.C., which makes it difficult to produce agricultural goods. Administration is particularly difficult in the neighboring island of Kiribati, whose population of 100,000 people is spread over 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean'an area about the size of the Indian subcontinent. **Why size matters** Small states share a number of intrinsic characteristics that have translated into a common set of development challenges. Because of their small size, they have higher fixed and variable costs of providing public goods, with little scope to exploit economies of scale. In the private sector, higher costs have led to concentrated markets with less competition. Very high shares of imports and exports in most small states help them to overcome weak competition and to invigorate growth. But this high degree of openness has heavily exposed them to external shocks in global markets. Small size also hinders these countries from diversifying into a wide range of activities, making them more vulnerable to shocks. Domestic financial markets in small states tend to be shallow. They have less favorable access to global capital as investors often perceive them to be more risky. To make matters worse, most small states are prone to natural disasters and some are particularly susceptible to climate change. Micro states in the [Caribbean and the [Pacific suffer annual costs equivalent to some 3 to 5 percent of GDP because of natural disasters. And the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects Kiribati to be the first country to see its entire territory disappear underwater as a result of global climate change. **Make the most of what you've got** Given these vulnerabilities, are small states doomed to lag behind their larger peers? Actually, the longer-term economic performance of small states has been generally good. Per capita income levels and social indicators broadly match those of their larger peers. Some small states have been able to overcome certain size-related challenges by achieving higher levels of such growth determinants as openness, education, and financial development. The key to achieving economic success may be to pursue policies that exploit their advantages and offset their disadvantages. One way of offsetting the size disadvantage is through regional integration and cooperation. For example, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union's Regional Government Securities Market aims to integrate existing national securities markets into a single regional market, helping to exploit economies of scale in financial markets. Since the late 1990s, however, most small states have experienced slower and more volatile growth than larger peers. With higher public spending, a number of small states now face high debt burdens. In light of these developments, we have stepped up our engagement with small states. The heightened interest began when several of the IMF's Executive Board members created an informal working group on economic issues in small states. Internally, collaboration has increased since a small islands group was formed to facilitate the sharing of insights and lessons learned by staff working on small states. To weather natural disasters and other external shocks, small states have used a number of IMF financing instruments'including the Rapid Credit Facility, a type of emergency assistance. Delivery of technical assistance and training, particularly through our regional technical centers, plays a vital role in building small states' capacities. Staff exchanges involving national governments, regional entities, and the IMF and other international organizations may also help to strengthen small states' institutions. And we are collaborating closely with other international institutions and development partners to meet small states' needs and learn from their experiences. We plan to pursue analytical work on issues affecting small states, maintain an active dialogue with country and regional officials, and continue to help build their capacity. Over time, these efforts should help reduce small states' vulnerability and increase their resilience.

Sayeh** ( For many years, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have spent large amounts on subsidizing fuel and electricity. For both sources of energy combined, this averages around 3-4 percent of GDP. That's about the same magnitude as public spending on health in many countries. Now we need to ask some important questions. Is this a good use of scarce resources? Where does this money go? Is it helping to support the livelihood of the poorest in African economies? Is it helping to boost the country's competitiveness? The answers are largely, no. I believe this money can and must be used better to invest in the critical physical and social infrastructure required to sustain growth in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent [IMF paper backs this up. **Tracking who benefits** Most of the fuel products are consumed by higher income groups. The situation is even more acute with electricity subsidies, as a large majority of the poor are not even connected to the grid. Sometimes, the benefits don't even stay in the country, given the incentives to smuggle subsidized fuel products to higher price neighboring countries. Oil exporters generally have higher subsidies because they are less likely to face the financing constraints that oil importers may encounter when international oil prices are high. In addition, subsidy costs tend to be less transparent'appearing in the form of lower profits of state oil companies rather than explicit costs to the budget.** **Sometimes they fall into the trap of looking at their low costs of production instead of the resources forgone if they sold the fuel at world market prices. That said, we need to approach reform in a transparent and carefully planned way. Removing subsidies will affect all income groups, given the poor do receive some of the benefits, including from the impact of lower transport prices on food costs. **Eyes on growth** There are also serious costs from a more medium- to longer-term growth perspective. First, subsidies distort investment decisions by both the public and private sectors. A failure by power companies to recover costs leads to a vicious circle of underinvestment: neglected infrastructure crumbles, leading to frequent power outages that reduce competitiveness and depress potential growth. Private investors are discouraged from much needed investment to expand supply. This is indeed the story of sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-1980s, where per- capita energy production and consumption have barely increased, and where today (excluding South Africa) installed capacity for the entire region is still about one-third that of Spain. Without a significant increase in power generation capacity, sub-Saharan Africa will not be able to maintain current economic growth rates for the next two decades. Simulations done by the World Bank suggest that if electricity infrastructure in all sub-Saharan countries were improved to that of a better performer (such as Mauritius), long-term per capita growth rates would be 2 percentage points higher. In many countries, small-scale operations and a reliance on expensive thermal systems or emergency power drive up costs. Countries flush with low-cost hydro or natural gas resources need to increase production and build the infrastructure to invigorate regional trading through power pools. Also, [energy subsidies directly crowd out other critical spending, including on much-needed infrastructure and social services. For example, even after recent reductions, Nigeria's government spends more of their outlays on energy subsidies than on education and health. **Mounting costs** We see other costs too, such as the environmental costs from overconsumption of fuel products relative to other forms of energy. In a continent blessed with considerable sources of renewable energy'hydro and solar for example'subsidies continue to encourage fossil fuel dependency and undermine the competitiveness of these renewable sources. So if there are large opportunity costs and the poor are not gaining much, why do subsidies continue? How do we go about reforming them? One reason for their persistence is that energy subsidies are a relatively easy way for governments to transfer resources, especially when compared to undeveloped social safety nets. A second is that politically vocal interest groups who are the main beneficiaries are loath to give up these large handouts and will seek to undermine reform efforts. And third, the population at large is often reluctant to give up these subsidies, not trusting that their government will use the savings for either better social protection or growth-enhancing investment. **A path to reform** Reform is therefore not easy. But the IMF's detailed review of country experiences across the globe highlights some useful lessons that can increase the chances of success. Let me highlight three that are of particular importance in sub-Saharan Africa. First, careful preparation and sequencing is needed. You need to build public understanding of the status quo'how much is being expended on subsidies and who is benefiting? It takes time to build consensus for reducing energy subsidies among all stakeholders. Both Namibia and Kenya took many years of preparation before successful energy reforms were implemented. Part of careful preparation involves a strong public communications campaign, introducing compensatory measures for those most affected, and demonstrating how the savings will be used. Second, sustained reform requires strong institutions. Tanzania's fuel subsidy reform included the establishment of a specialized regulatory entity, not only to issue licenses and technical regulations, but also to keep the public constantly informed about prices and to review the proper functioning of the market. And third, durable electricity subsidy reduction requires much more than tariff increases. Tariffs in sub-Saharan Africa are already considerably higher than in other regions because of higher costs. Efficiency gains in public utilities are possible through improving governance, lowering distribution and commercial losses and raising revenue collection rates. And low levels of public debt in many sub-Saharan African countries provide an opportunity for significant investment in cheaper sources of energy production. Energy subsidy reform is a critical policy challenge that is central to the future growth agenda in sub-Saharan Africa. While a gradual approach may be appropriate given the overall difficulties, the payoffs from successful reform are huge. So we now need to approach subsidy reform with renewed vigor'there is no time to waste. **Listen to the Podcast here:** ", "index": 442}, {"pub": "3/27/2013", "title": "Subsidizing Energy Consumption: Why it\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Wrong and What Can Be Done About it", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6069", "content": " [By [Carlo Cottarelli ( Let's face it. Everybody loves cheap energy. Almost all human activities require energy consumption and, if something is so basic, it seems pretty obvious that it should not be denied to anyone and government should make it as cheap as possible to both households and companies, including through subsidies. This can help households avoid paying exorbitant energy bills at the end of the month, something that the poor may not be able to afford even for basic needs like heating and cooking. Companies may also need energy subsidies to help them stay competitive. Energy subsidies appear even more appropriate, and even the obvious thing to do, in countries that have a large supply of energy, like oil producers. After all, this natural wealth in the form of energy belongs to the people; why shouldn't it be cheap? **There's a better way** And yet, energy subsidies (the difference between the price consumers should pay for energy to cover supply costs and the appropriate consumption tax and what they actually pay) are not a very smart thing, as argued in a recent IMF study, \"[Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications.\" * For starters, they are not really a good way of achieving what governments say they want to achieve. When it comes to households' consumption, subsidies are not really a well-targeted way of supporting the poor. Indeed, our work shows that, because the rich consume much more than the poor, in emerging and low-income countries 43 percent of energy subsidies (before taxation) go to the richest 20 percent of the population. As for subsidizing consumption by companies, this ends up fostering the survival of the inefficient, which certainly cannot be good for growth in the long run. * Second, energy subsidies are costly and therefore preempt more useful public spending (for education or infrastructure, for example). This is true even for energy producers as the revenues from, say, selling oil on the international market could be used for more productive purposes than subsidizing energy consumption. * And, third, because of subsidies, countries end up consuming too much energy. This is bad for the environment, for example through excessive CO2 emissions, which aggravates climate change. Our estimates indicate that eliminating energy subsidies would reduce CO2 emissions by 4\u00c2? billion tons, a 13 percent reduction.**** **Here, there, everywhere** How common are energy subsidies? Well, subsidies are pervasive. Let's start with the 'pre-tax'\u009d subsidies that arise when prices that consumers pay are below the supply costs of energy. Although relatively few countries have pre- tax subsidies, their magnitude is not trivial: in 2011 they amounted to some $480 billion, or 0.7 percent of world GDP and 2 percent of public revenues. And they are much more sizable in certain areas of the world: for example, they amounted to 8.6 percent of GDP and 21.8 percent of revenues in the Middle East and North Africa region. But many more [countries fail to tax energy sufficiently. Well, what is meant by 'taxing energy sufficiently'\u009d? Energy should be taxed like any other product, just to raise revenues. In addition, energy needs to be taxed a bit more because its consumption causes damages to the rest of the population, for example by polluting the environment, which is what economists call 'externalities.'\u009d Taking these costs into account, and using relatively conservative estimates, our study shows that in 2011 post-tax subsidies amounted to $1.9 trillion, or 2.7 percent of world GDP and 8 percent of total government revenues. The offenders here include the advanced economies, where every single one is under-taxing energy'and the Unites States accounting for about one fourth of all post-tax subsidies. **Changing course** Eliminating energy subsidies is not impossible. Our study looks, in particular, at the reform of subsidies in 19 countries, covering a number of cases where governments attempted to reduce pre-tax subsidies. We found that there are six key elements for success: * A comprehensive reform plan, which is preferable to ad hoc decisions: clear long-term objectives are needed, such as achieving full price liberalization and improving the quality of service. * A far-reaching communications strategy and consultation with stakeholders: people must understand that subsidies involve costs for the economy and society as a whole, not benefits. * Protecting the poor: this need not be difficult, at least in terms of resources: with most subsidies benefitting the rich, their elimination allows not only to fully compensate the poor, but also to make resources available for pro-growth, pro-equity public spending. * Appropriately phased and sequenced price increases, which allow time for households and governments to adjust their energy consumption. Absent large and immediate fiscal pressures, there is no need to frontload the adjustment, and a gradual pace has proved to be more acceptable as long as it is part of a clear comprehensive strategy. * Improving the efficiency of state-owned enterprises to help reduce their fiscal burden. * Depoliticizing the setting of energy prices, which is needed to make durable reforms. One should also look at the tax components of subsidies, which are large in some advanced economies with high public debt. An increase in energy taxation can be a critical component in fiscal consolidation plans that are badly needed in light of recent surges in public debt to historically almost unprecedented levels. In sum, there's a sound case for reforming energy subsidies, and a rich background of country experience that provides a roadmap for reform. In this light, renewed efforts at subsidy reform are well justified.

In energy-rich countries, governments provide subsidies to their populations as a way of sharing the natural resource wealth. In the region's energy-importing countries, governments use subsidies to offer people some relief from high commodity prices, especially since social safety nets are often weak. The question is: does this well-intended social protection policy represent the most efficient way to channel aid to the most vulnerable? The answer is no! **Costly and harmful scheme** [Energy subsidies are very costly, explicitly and implicitly. In 2011, they amounted to about $240 billion, more than 8.5 percent of regional GDP. Particularly in the region's oil importing-countries, subsidies eat up a large part of governments' budgets, which often leads to higher deficit and debt levels. In addition, there is a clear opportunity cost to providing energy subsidies'spending money there means limiting valuable investments elsewhere. Areas such as health care, education, or infrastructure that are essential to improving the long-term economic prospects of the region can easily end up neglected, thus dampening growth. Moreover, in oil-exporting and oil-importing countries alike, energy subsidies are highly inequitable. If we look at who actually benefits from those subsidies, it's clear that the bulk of the benefit goes to the better-off, who use energy the most'people with automobiles, air-conditioned houses, and electrical appliances. Energy subsidies also have other harmful effects on the economy. When something comes cheaply, people tend to buy more than they need, resulting in excessive consumption and higher pollution. Furthermore, subsidies can also lower profits'or cause losses'for energy companies, making it less likely that they will invest in the energy sector and potentially leading to energy shortages. And subsidies encourage capital- intensive investment rather than job-creating investment. Despite the many good arguments for dismantling energy subsidies, in practice this has not been easy. Reform attempts face resistance by vested interests and by households who are not convinced that the government will use wisely the resources saved. Now, how do governments go about reforming energy subsidies once consumers have become accustomed to them? **Weaning off subsidies** To succeed, governments need to carefully plan subsidy reform and make sure to not unduly affect the most vulnerable. The IMF has just completed a review of 22 country case studies of energy subsidy reform. The results varied, but suggest the following six key ingredients for success: **_A comprehensive energy sector reform plan._** The plan should include clear long-term objectives, an assessment of the impact, and consultation with those affected by it. **_A good communications strategy._** A strong communications campaign helps generate broad understanding and support for change and should be undertaken throughout the reform process, emphasizing not just the cost of subsidies but also the benefits of reform. **_Measures to compensate the poor._** It is crucial that those who are hardest hit by the removal of subsidies are compensated from the beginning. There are many ways to subsidize the poor, either by subsidizing the goods they consume, targeting regions where they live, or by providing them lifeline tariffs and cash transfers. **_Phased price increases._** Phasing in price increases and sequencing them differently across energy products can be helpful. Too sharp an increase in energy prices can generate intense opposition. A phased strategy will allow people and businesses to adjust and governments to strengthen social safety nets. **_Improved efficiency of state-owned enterprises to reduce producer subsidies._** State-owned companies'especially power generation'often receive substantial budgetary resources to compensate for inefficiencies in production, distribution, and revenue collection. Improving their operational efficiency can strengthen the financial position of these enterprises and reduce the need for subsidies. **_Depoliticized price setting._** Durable reforms require a depoliticized mechanism for setting energy prices and allow the transmission of changes in world prices to domestic prices. Automatic pricing mechanisms can reduce the chances of reform reversal, while price smoothing rules can help avoid large price changes. **IMF technical expertise can help** The IMF can be a key partner for subsidies reforms that can unlock growth, reduce inequality, and help the environment. The IMF can help make the case for subsidy reform by explaining how costly subsidies really are, and provide'in collaboration with the World Bank and other stakeholders'the technical expertise on how to design and sequence the removal of subsidies, strengthen targeted social safety nets, and establish automatic mechanisms to smooth price movements while protecting the government's budget. It can also share the lessons of experience from across its membership. The IMF's advice can help countries free up fiscal space to preserve or expand social spending and investment, a crucial objective in many countries in the region'particularly those in transition'where governments must support better their citizens but also face a difficult fiscal environment. **Supporting the people** [The economic and social challenges facing many countries of the region underscore the widespread desire to shift away from the status quo and to embrace new socioeconomic policies. A shift from subsidizing energy to supporting the people would help respond to the region's social needs, raise investment, eliminate distortions, enhance human capital, and create jobs.**** ", "index": 444}, {"pub": "3/18/2013", "title": "An Open and Diverse Economy To Benefit All Algerians", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=6030", "content": " [By [Christine Lagarde (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) I was in Algiers last week, my first time as the Managing Director of the IMF. It was a good visit: we reaffirmed the special partnership between Algeria and the IMF, and I was able to gain a deeper insight into Algeria's aspirations'and also its challenges in reaching a hopeful future. **A true partnership** As partners, we listen to each other on many levels. On the morning of my arrival in Algiers, the IMF team had conducted a seminar with government and business representatives to discuss the findings of our recent annual check-up of the economy, known as an Article IV report. I continued that dialogue with my many interlocutors: President Bouteflika and other senior officials including Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal, Finance Minister Karim Djoudi, Governor of the Banque d'Alg\u00c3\u00a9rie Mohammed Laksaci, as well as academics, business people and representatives from civil society. I particularly enjoyed a breakfast with a group of women leaders, which included politicians, film directors, NGOs and businesswomen. They all spoke passionately about their lives, their commitment, and their hopes for their country. Huge talent! Our partnership with Algeria is reciprocal in many ways. In the 1990s, during difficult times, the country borrowed from the IMF. Today it is a creditor. I thanked the authorities for Algeria's US $5 billion pledge the IMF's global firewall'an investment that we will guard well and repay with interest if the funds are used. That Algeria is in a position to support the global effort to contain the crisis is in part due to its capable management of its oil and gas windfall. This has resulted in high foreign exchange reserves and economic stability. Yet the goal of continued stability'and certainly the hope for more broadly shared growth'cannot be taken lightly. Everybody I spoke to in Algiers agreed the country needs a more open and diverse economy to create a bigger pie, and to ensure that _all_ Algerians get their fair share in it. So what are the priorities for generating more inclusive growth? **Ensuring economic stability** Steady growth, and low fiscal and external deficits and debt levels are core building blocks for future prosperity. On all of these counts, Algeria's economy has performed well over the past decade, and often in the shadow of global uncertainty. However, inflation has been on the rise, reaching nearly 9 percent last year'a 15'year high. The causes have been wage hikes that exceeded productivity increases, and relatively accommodative monetary policies. Such pressures risk undermining growth and hurting the most vulnerable. It's no accident that inflation has been called the worst 'tax' on the poor. Fortunately, steps in the right direction have already been taken: this year's budget contains demand pressures on prices as it keeps the rise of current spending and public wages in check, and last year's decision to raise the required reserves rate as well as the liquidity absorption will help. Still, further monetary tightening may be necessary. **Building a vibrant private sector** Oil and gas have served Algeria well. In fact, the country's reliance on hydrocarbon is almost unparalleled: it accounts for around 40 percent of total GDP, 98 percent of exports, and two-thirds of budget revenues. But only about 2 percent of the workforce is directly employed by the sector. This cannot provide a lasting basis for jobs or rising living standards for the wider population. The issue therefore is how best to use Algeria's vast natural blessings to spark lasting and inclusive growth that creates good jobs for all. The answer, I believe, is a vibrant private sector that works hand-in-hand with government. Indeed, many of the businesspeople I met in Algeria spoke of their country's huge potential in agribusiness, industry and services such as tourism and trade. Now is the time to open up to reach out to global markets and to also let some of the world in'for investment, trade, and expertise. In our discussions, we identified some of the steps that can be taken to improve the business environment, from the reducing red tape to changing the rules for foreign ownership. It will take time to fundamentally change the business climate, but a start can be made now. **Reforming_ _the_ _labor market ** Stability ultimately hinges on providing jobs, especially for those first entering the labor market. Here Algeria has come a long way: while a decade ago youth unemployment stood at more than 50 percent, it has since dropped to 20 percent'still unacceptably high, with many more young adults soon to be looking for work. So, reforming the labor market is essential for sustainable job creation. Some might think that, coming from the IMF, labor market reform means pay cuts. Well, the world has changed and the IMF has changed. The bigger issue in Algeria is that too many people rely on the government as _the_ employer of choice. Mindsets need to change. The next generation of Algerians also should aspire to be doctors or lawyers or engineers, and to run their own businesses. Government policies can give them a helping hand. One step, for example, would be changing laws and regulations that make it hard for private businesses to employ people. More active labor market policies'such as jobs-based training for young graduates or job placement programs'can also help, particularly with better matching worker skills to the needs of the labor market. **Protecting the most vulnerable ** Like in many countries, prices for certain goods and services in Algeria are subsidized by the government, which means they are made cheaper than they should be. This is very costly and does a bad job of supporting those truly in need. For gasoline and gas alone, implicit subsidies provided by the government may be as much as 12 percent of GDP. The main beneficiaries are the well-to-do who consume energy more heavily, for example because they drive bigger cars. At the same time, subsidies steal precious resources away from other government spending priorities, including on health, education, and infrastructure. This problem cannot of course be tackled over night. As a first step, subsidies should be made explicit and better targeted to the people who really need them. **Working together** Creating a more prosperous and more inclusive Algeria will take time. And, at times, the way forward may not be easy. In this, Algeria is not alone. Some of the issues I have mentioned'inclusion, jobs, a more flourishing private sector, subsidy reform to better help the truly needy'are just as pressing for other countries in the region. We all must do our part to tackle these challenges together. Our partnership with Algeria, built on the kind of constructive dialogue that I had there last week, is a good basis to do so.

Let's celebrate the incredible progress women have made over the past decades in different parts of society, playing a key role in economic life that our grandmothers worked for and dreamed about. Today, although men still dominate the executive suites in most professions, women all over the world hold high positions in the private sector and in public office. Women are no longer the _Second Sex_ Simone de Beauvoir wrote about. **But far too many women face the most fundamental challenges: the right to safety and to choose the life they want.** Across the globe, fewer women than men are in paid employment, with only about 50 percent of working-age women participating in the labor force. In many countries, laws, regulations and social norms still constrain women's possibilities to seek paid employment. And all over the world women conduct most of the work that remains unseen and unpaid, in the fields and in households. **Women who get paid for their work earn less than their male colleagues, even when doing the same work, which economists call the gender wage gap**. Across the advanced and emerging economy countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the gender wage gap is about 16 percent. Many women take career breaks or work part time to take care of children and elderly family members, and therefore get lower pensions'a problem in itself, and one with implications for public finances. **And tax regimes often impose a higher tax on so-called 'second earners'\u009d in the family, reducing the incentives for women to work.** The economic crisis has only complicated this picture. In developing economies, girls' school completion rates have dropped more rapidly than those of boys. ** In advanced economies female unemployment has been on the rise'for instance in Portugal and Spain.** If these trends were to persist beyond the crisis, they could spell further trouble for women's participation in the labor market. Women have huge talents. Employers who don't offer equal opportunities to women simply ignore a large part of the skilled workforce. **In many countries, growth could be much higher if more women were in paid employment**. In [Japan, for example, raising the female labor force participation rate to Northern European levels would permanently raise per capita GDP by 8 percent. Women also have great entrepreneurial potential. For instance, women-owned companies represent between 30 and 40 percent of formal small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets. Also, raising women's incomes will improve education levels, as [ research shows that women spend a larger share of their income on the welfare of their children. **This will take changes in a wide range of areas, and let me mention a few I think can begin to make a difference.** Politicians can change legislation to provide equal opportunities for women to own property, get credit, and work outside the home. And equal access to health services, education, and vocational training will prepare women for paid employment. **Better infrastructure, transportation, and child care will also allow more women to seek paid work.** In rural South Africa, for example, access to electricity gave women the opportunity to work less in the household and more outside the home, increasing women's labor force participation by about 9 percent. And in Mexico, the federal daycare program for working mothers has helped low-income mothers. **In advanced economies, more women will work if they have access to parental leave and affordable child care**. Sweden is a good example of this, with a difference in labor force participation rates between men and women of only 6 percentage points, compared to 25 percentage points in Japan. Breaking down the barriers between part-time and full-time work contracts also encourages women to join the work force. For example, in the Netherlands the female labor force participation rate increased from about 35 percent in 1980 to more than 80 percent in 2008, largely as a result of more attractive part-time work options. **And flexible work arrangements help women to juggle their many responsibilities and to achieve a better work-life balance.** We can help. The International Monetary Fund is in continuous dialogue with its member countries on how to achieve stability and growth. Women's labor force participation is one part of this equation'all the more so at a time when many countries are struggling with the fiscal impact of aging populations and high public debts. Access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises is another key issue. We are not experts in all the complex elements at work in this area, but we can flag issues and draw on the expertise of others. In addition, **we can use our fiscal expertise to look into ways to assess whether tax regimes and the allocation of public resources contribute to gender equality and better opportunities for women.** Today, on International Women's Day, we see both amazing achievements and formidable challenges. **But I am an optimist and see beyond these challenges; our daughters and granddaughters will have even better opportunities than women have today.** And let us always remember that when women are allowed to develop their full potential, it is not only women who gain, but the whole world.

This [video looks at this puzzle from a somewhat different perspective than the usual'and still correct'narrative of weak banks and over-indebted public sectors caught in a vicious cycle. More specifically, we examine the role of household and corporate balance sheets in the countries under financial market stress and the implications for policy priorities. Some countries in the euro area do not just suffer from over-extended government and bank balance sheets, but also from over-extended household and corporate balance sheets. While the type of stress (household, corporate, or bank) differs from country to country, it is sufficiently large to be a potential drag on domestic demand. The negative relationship between pre- crisis indebtedness and post crisis growth'in incomes, consumption, and investment' is striking. [ The downdraft on growth from corporate and household balance sheet problems is likely to be with us for some time. Obviously this affects the financial situation of governments and banks, worsening the interdependence between flagging growth, public finances, and banking health. This has resulted in lending rates that are still too high in countries such as Spain and Italy, despite strong efforts from the European Central Bank. As this chart makes clear, the transmission of easy monetary policy remains impaired. [ Meanwhile, there have been spillovers via trade, financial linkages, and confidence to Europe more widely. Growth has been weak even in economic powerhouses like Germany and in the emerging markets to the east. [ [ [ All this argues for a more nuanced policy response by countries and European institutions that allows balance sheets to adjust but with minimum output and job losses: * For countries: Given the downdraft on consumption and investment, fiscal policy should emphasize long-term measures to raise primary balances and/or cyclically adjusted balances'as opposed to headline deficit targets. Structural measures on the supply side (labor and product market reforms) are crucial to offsetting some of the output cost of depressed demand. We also need to take a second look at whether the legal framework supports timely workouts of household debt. * For the European Union: Fully translating easy monetary policy into easier lending rates is probably the most pressing issue to tackle. Initiatives such as the European Central Bank's Outright Monetary Transactions framework, which would allow for the purchase of government bonds will help but a faster move to a banking union also seems essential, as argued in [a recently-released staff paper. Policymakers will need to make progress on the broader reform of the European Monetary Union's architecture, including fiscal union and'more urgently'the use of the European Stability Mechanism for direct recapitalization of banks. Pressing ahead with orderly balance sheet repair at the national level, and supportive monetary policy and European Monetary Union architecture will help translate the financial market recovery into a real economic rebound.

Our audience appeared encouraged by our assessment of performance over the previous three years (2008'10): the economy had been recovering strongly, supported by generous aid and an easing of Israeli restrictions on movement and trade. And the Palestinian Authority had made impressive progress in institution- building, which alongside prudent fiscal management, had enhanced public- sector efficiency, reduced wasteful expenditure, and enabled a reduction in its recurrent budget deficit from US$1.7 billion in 2008 to US$1.1 billion in 2010. But the mood in the room became less upbeat as our discussion turned to the risks facing the economy. Donor aid had started to fall below the amounts needed to finance the Palestinian Authority's already tight budgets. The decline appeared to be driven largely by donor fatigue from a deadlocked peace process, rising global economic challenges, and competing aid needs of countries in the region with the onset of what became known as the Arab Spring. Today, two years later, the [Palestinian Authority is facing a major fiscal crisis that is raising social tensions and threatening its operations. The donor aid shortfalls, worsened by repeated delays in the transfer of clearance revenues (which are indirect taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority) have led to a rapid buildup of domestic payments arrears and borrowing up to domestic commercial banks' limits. The drop in aid, coupled with the persistence of restrictions on trade and movement of goods and people, has also hurt economic growth and contributed to an increase in unemployment. The Palestinian Authority's** financing difficulties** will have severe negative consequences unless they are addressed quickly. Given its limited scope for further arrears and debt accumulation, the Palestinian Authority would be forced to cut public-sector wages and core operating expenditures. This would severely impair its operations, and could erode the institutional gains of recent years. There have already been repeated delays in the payment of public-sector wages, which have led to recurrent strikes in ministries and government agencies. In addition, there is a risk that assistance targeted to the needy will be curtailed, further fueling social tensions. Finally, the buildup of domestic arrears is bound to weaken private-sector confidence in the government's ability to meet its payment obligations. **Concerted action** by the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and the international community are needed to address the immediate fiscal crisis and help support a lasting recovery in Palestinians' living standards. First, the Palestinian Authority needs to prepare for the possibility of continued shortfalls in aid by containing the budget deficit. To that end, several measures are key, including increased restraint on the public-sector wage bill and better targeting of employee allowances. Other expenditures should continue to be prioritized, and cash management strengthened to ensure that nonessential spending takes the brunt of cuts. Tax administration should continue to be enhanced by widening the tax base and improving compliance. It is also important to press ahead with civil service and pension reforms and to strengthen the legal framework facing businesses. Second, the understandings reached in mid-2012 between the Palestinian Authority and Israel on measures to enhance the collection of clearance revenue and ensure its timely transfer to the Palestinian Authority are important steps in bilateral economic cooperation and should be implemented promptly, given that clearance revenue represents the bulk of the Palestinian Authority's income. A broadening of that cooperation to include an easing of Israeli restrictions on external trade and movement of goods and people in the West Bank and Gaza is essential to expand private-sector growth and employment and to reduce the Palestinian Authority's reliance on aid. Over the past two decades, real GDP per capita has been substantially influenced by the extent of such restrictions (see figure). Finally, it is **critical** for the international community to re-engage in supporting the economic development of the West Bank and Gaza, in particular by providing a framework for economic cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis. More immediately, it is important that the Palestinian Authority's efforts be complemented by the prompt disbursement of additional donor aid to prevent a further buildup of arrears and debt to commercial banks, and avoid a serious disruption of the Palestinian Authority's core operations. Timely disbursement of aid is essential for sustaining an orderly path of budget deficit reduction and institution-building toward a self-reliant Palestinian state.

I suggest that policymakers de-clutter their to-do lists by focusing on** three priorities**. These policies will help economies grow and will significantly improve financial and monetary stability in 2013 and beyond. **Strong banks** **We need strong banks that can support economic growth**. Financial institutions in advanced economies look healthier today. But policymakers have yet to complete the cleanup of the banking sector. This is a particularly pressing issue in Europe, where weak banks have become a drag on growth. Non-performing loan ratios continue to rise in several countries in the euro area periphery and emerging economies in Europe amid high unemployment and anemic growth. Some banks may need extra capital cushions to offset this deterioration in the quality of their loans. And in some cases, direct recapitalization of weak euro area banks through the European Stability Mechanism should be a viable option. Other banks, however, may prove to be beyond repair and must be restructured, or wound down, to prevent the emergence of 'zombie'\u009d banks. These financial institutions have little or no capacity to provide fresh loans to companies and households. They also tend to avoid writing down bad loans. This masks inevitable losses and creates 'zombie'\u009d companies that are unviable in the longer term. Weak banks in Europe should complete their spring cleaning this year to get the real economy back on track. But they cannot do it alone. This work requires a joint commitment by all financial industry stakeholders, including management, investors, regulators, and political leaders. **Strong regulation** **We need strong financial regulation and supervision that encourage a shift towards lower-risk business models**. This would support financial stability and growth and restore confidence in some of the world's biggest banks. Much has been done, but the job has yet to be completed. The new international banking rules known as Basel III need to be implemented, and further work is needed on the too-big-to-fail problem, over-the-counter derivatives reform, and shadow banking regulation. National authorities must make further progress in the next few months in implementing the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements. Worryingly, there are still significant differences across countries in banks' calculations of basic Basel III metrics such as risk-weighted assets. Policymakers must therefore encourage a steady, and internationally consistent, buildup of the new capital and liquidity buffers to minimize the risk of banks seeking out jurisdictions with the most lenient rules. [IMF research shows that larger, shock-absorbing capital and liquidity buffers contribute to lower financial stress and higher and more stable economic growth. This is particularly true in cases where these buffers consist of high-quality capital and more liquid assets. I also believe the reform of the market for derivatives must shift into high gear. The wider use of derivatives clearing houses, known as central counterparties, will increase transparency in the over-the-counter derivatives market and will help make the financial system as a whole less risky. But national authorities have not met recent deadlines to implement these reforms, reflecting the legal complexities of this opaque industry. Recent scandals involving complex derivatives suggest that banks' internal risk controls are all too often inadequate, leaving investors, regulators, and banking executives in the dark. Because of their size, complexity, and interconnectedness, some banks are still considered 'too-important-to-fail'\u009d. Policymakers must remove this unacceptable moral hazard. For example, the Financial Stability Board is promoting the establishment of [effective resolution regimes that allow unviable banks to die safely. And the IMF encourages financial centers in particular to swiftly adopt resolution regimes. The United States and the United Kingdom have recently become trail-blazers in this area. They have agreed to coordinate their contingency plans for winding down failing cross-border banks. But creating stronger rules is not enough. We also need stronger supervisors who can enforce the new rules in a fair and effective manner. One of their biggest challenges is the need to address risks to the financial system as a whole. Policymakers largely ignored these systemic risks in the run-up to the recent global financial crisis. This year, many national authorities will need to press ahead with the implementation of new [macroprudential policies to identify and mitigate risks to the financial system as whole. This requires national decisions on the institutional and operational aspects of these policies. The IMF has been heavily involved in the development of the new macroprudential frameworks and policies. And we will support their implementation by integrating the new concepts into our surveillance and technical assistance work. **Strong central banks** **We need strong central banks that are independent and continue to deliver on price stability**. More than five years after the onset of the financial crisis, central bankers continue to face a daunting challenge'how to respond to the changing demands placed on them, while preserving credibility and confidence that were built up over a long period. This balancing act is at the center of an increasingly lively public debate about the effectiveness of monetary policy in a world of ultra-low interest rates, anemic growth, and high unemployment. It is a healthy discussion because it compels central bankers to reinforce their commitment to price stability and independence that have served us well. I believe the focus on price stability'avoiding both inflation and deflation'remains the most appropriate goal of monetary policy. It may be tempting to think that countries can use increased inflation to address high public debt ratios, which continue to weigh on growth and financial stability in many advanced economies. Yet countries cannot use inflation to substantially reduce the real value of public debt unless inflation shocks are large and unanticipated, and uncertainty may actually push up real interest rates. The cost of such policy action would be unacceptable: numerous historical examples\u00c2\u00ad underscore the devastating impact of high inflation on economic growth and social stability. I therefore believe that we need to preserve independent central banks with a mandate and tools to maintain price stability. Empirical evidence strongly suggests that central bank independence is associated with lower inflation. We must preserve these achievements, even while we need to modify the traditional monetary policy toolkit. Some commentators have recently argued that extraordinary monetary policy actions, such as quantitative easing, may have already undermined central bank independence. But there is little evidence to support this claim. Granted, many central banks have taken actions that would have been inconceivable in normal times. But they have done so in the context of their mandates and have steered clear of political pressures. Strong central banks that are independent and continue to deliver on price stability will be well equipped to navigate this new world. **Perfecting the plan is a must** I believe these priorities'strong banks, strong regulation, and strong central banks'should be at the top of the policy to-do lists. They are 'must-haves'\u009d, rather than 'nice-to-haves.'\u009d They will support growth and significantly improve financial and monetary stability in the medium term. I also believe that policymakers can muster the necessary resolve to stick to these priorities.

In India, the rupee has strengthened and the Bombay Stock Exchange index (Sensex) crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time in two years. Industrial production has started picking up. **So is India's growth about to go back to 8-9 percent? The short answer is no**. But we need to look back to understand why India's growth has decelerated to a decade low and why the slump, which has hit investment particularly hard, has persisted for over a year. As structural problems are at the root of the slowdown, so structural reforms must be at the core of the solution. In the IMF's annual check-up of India's [economy, **we attribute the slowdown mainly to structural factors. ** These include supply bottlenecks, but also uncertainty about policies, and lengthy delays in investment project approvals and implementation. Of course, subdued global growth and higher real interest rates have also contributed, but were not the main culprits. Our report also points out that India has one of the highest fiscal deficits and inflation among emerging markets. Also, India's external position has weakened, and banks' and corporates' balance sheets have deteriorated. **This analysis implies that there is no quick fix. Getting investment going again is not a matter of lowering interest rates or raising government spending. Structural measures that help lift obstacles to investments are vital. ** At the same time, lowering the fiscal deficit and inflation are necessary to ensure investment revives. Strengthening bank and corporate balance sheets is also important so that, once conditions are favorable to investment, firms will find adequate financing. Keenly aware of these challenges, the Indian authorities have started to act in recent months. Addressing the nation on September 21, 2012, the Prime Minister said, 'We need a revival in investor confidence, domestically and globally'\u00a6 the time has come for hard decisions.'\u009d Speaking at the Economic Editors' Conference on October 9, 2012, the Finance Minister P. Chidambaram cautioned, 'Without reforms, we risk a sharp and continuing slowdown of the [economy which we cannot afford'\u00a6'\u009d **Indian officials have taken steps to restructure the debts and reduce the losses of state power distribution companies, to facilitate large investment projects with the Cabinet Committee on Investment, to liberalize Foreign Direct Investment, and reduce uncertainty in tax policy**. The Finance Minister presented a roadmap to reduce government deficits. Buttressing this commitment, the government has started to contain fuel subsidy spending and to roll out cash transfers, which could improve spending efficiency considerably over time. Are these measures enough? They have definitely boosted financial markets and economic confidence, but the impact will depend on successful implementation and follow-up. Negative growth in mining and low electricity output growth suggest that supply-side bottlenecks persist, and investment continues to be weak. **Addressing long standing and complex structural issues holds the key to reviving growth.** For example, resolving problems in the power sector'from fuel linkages to pricing and the financial health of distribution companies'is essential. We also see progress on inflation and the reduction of government debt and deficits as required to boost investment. The Planning Commission in the Draft 12th Plan has also presented growth scenarios contingent on the progress on reforms: they range from 8 percent growth with strong and wide-reaching policy implementation to 5-5.5 percent growth with policy logjam. Given the complexity of the issues, reviving investment in India is going to be a marathon not a sprint. That's the reason why we expect the recovery to be gradual and inflation and the current account deficit to remain elevated for some time. We project real GDP growth of 6 percent for the 2013-2014 fiscal year, gradually increasing to about 6.5-7 percent over the next 5 years. And because elevated inflation and a sizable current account deficit are also partly symptoms of supply bottlenecks, combined with persistent high inflation and a gradual reduction of government deficits, we expect modest progress on these variables too. However, more important than the exact numbers is progress on addressing the current impediments to investment. This will create a recovery that can be sustained and lay the foundations for faster growth. **Stamina to carry out the reforms is required.** *_Rahul Anand is an Economist in the IMF's Asia Pacific Department_.

The widespread belief was that it would benefit both south and north'capital was finally able to flow to where it would best be used and foster real convergence. But in fact, a lasting convergence in productivity did not materialize across the European Union. Instead, a competitiveness divide emerged. As the financial crisis gripped the euro area in 2010, these and other problems came to the fore. Three years later, the financial symptoms of the crisis are thankfully receding with a new sense of optimism in markets. But the underlying problems'lack of convergence of productivity and the structural flaws in the architecture of the monetary union'have only been partially addressed. So where do we stand, and what more is needed? **(Not) the right kind of integration** Europe has committed itself to increasingly harmonize legal structures and governance to facilitate the free flow of goods, services, and capital, as well as the free movement of its citizens. Even those European countries that are not part of the European Union, such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, share formal ties through pacts and treaties, such as the European Free Trade Agreement. But if Europe has clearly become more integrated de jure, has it made a difference, de facto, in economic terms? The answer is clearly yes. One simple way of illustrating this is to look at correlations of business cycles between countries. Figure 1-2, which depict these correlations, show the close links developed between European economies during the past decade. All economies in the European Union'not just euro area member states'are more tightly clustered now than they were. [ But integration has many more dimensions. For the 17 euro area members, the introduction of a common currency also meant a common monetary policy and, for a while, the convergence of risk premia. This encouraged capital to shift from the richer north to the poorer south (known as the periphery), and differences in sovereign yields across the euro area narrowed quickly. But as we now know, the optimism about the use of these funds turned out to be overdone. Domestic productivity in most of the recipient countries did not improve'credit was used to finance current consumption and investment in real estate rather than productive capital. In fact, there has been little absolute real convergence in the euro area. Those euro area countries that had low per capita incomes in 1999 did not have the highest per capita growth rates. The newly accessant countries from emerging Europe did better'their per capita incomes seem to be converging faster to northern Europe levels (Figure 3). These economies were in a better position to take advantage of global growth, attract FDI, and strengthened their integration in worldwide supply chains, in particular by building strong links with Germany. [ The crisis in the euro zone stems, in large part, from the unwinding of financial integration that occurred in the absence of the necessary accompanying improvements in productivity. As the gaps in growth prospects became apparent, financial markets again began to discriminate among countries that hitherto had enjoyed similar borrowing costs. This resulted in a reversal of capital flows and a fragmentation of the financial system in the euro zone. That fragmentation has had implications for the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The Target2 system, the mechanism by which national central banks in the euro area borrow from or lend to each other, is a good indicator of financial fragmentation along national borders (Figure 4). [ In late 2011, Target2 balances increased particularly due to fragmentation affecting the markets in Italy and Spain. Surplus countries, particularly Germany, provide the counterbalance. On the positive side, the existence of the Target 2 system was an important shock absorber that worked when needed, and now balances have stabilized. In the past three years, the hard-hit countries on the southern periphery have implemented tough reforms to improve their competitiveness, and these are now starting to bear fruit. But much work remains to be done. [Research from the IMF shows that if euro area member states managed to close half the gap with OECD best practice in labor market and pension policies, they could boost GDP by almost 1\u00c2? percent on average after five years'and by another 2\u00c2? percent if more competition is introduced into markets for products and services. As the reform policies take hold and growth prospects improve, private capital has to return again to the periphery. But the countries have to put it to good use'to finance investment that turns those prospects into reality. **Fixing the flaws** While national governments need to continue their reform efforts, it is by now widely accepted that managing the crisis also requires 'more Europe'\u009d to undo the financial fragmentation and avoid sudden stops in capital flows within the currency union. What is economically necessary is, however, politically difficult: public support for the European project has fallen in most EU member countries. So how much more integration is really necessary for the euro area and the European Union more generally? Many of the measures taken recently aim at strengthening the functioning of the monetary union. Figure 5 shows euro area policy actions taken over the last year or so. Actions which help growth are in yellow; those which help integration are in blue; and the intersection is in green. The process has not always been elegant and I would characterize it as 'just in time integration'\u009d'but euro area leaders have defied the skeptics and managed to make significant progress. [ Looking ahead, two elements would seem necessary to make the union more viable: a banking union, to make the financial sector more robust to future economic shocks; and more fiscal integration, to address the current gaps that amplify country-level shocks into zone-wide events. Recent decisions on the shape of a banking union constitute important steps to strengthen the architecture of monetary union. From an IMF perspective, a banking union also requires a common fiscal backstop to deal with resolution of troubled banks and a common approach to deposit insurance. There is not yet consensus on the shape of closer fiscal integration. Some proposals have been made for a common euro area treasury, with its own centralized budget. Other proposals call for the power to direct national budgets, and for common borrowing. Clearly, there are direct monetary implications, as well as substantial consequences for national sovereignty, that policymakers need to carefully think through. The empirical evidence from a variety of federations across the world shows governments can make many models work. **More integration, more growth** Further steps to integrate Europe are taking place against the backdrop of a still very weak economic outlook. For this reason, the focus needs to be squarely on growth, particularly to address unemployment, which has reached intolerable levels in much of the EU. That means making progress on national level reforms that will encourage labor mobility, product market reforms, and investments in infrastructure and education to foster competitiveness. Other reforms, such as central support for market access or troubled banks, need to happen at the eurozone level. 2012 was a year of balancing on the edges of cliffs and precipices for Europe. 2013 needs to be a year of climbing mountains'doing the long and hard work of restoring competiveness across economies to restore growth, and making steady progress on completing the architecture of the monetary union.

Unfortunately, it's also traditional that these commitments quickly fall by the wayside, only to be taken up again next year, usually with the same results.

The average headline deficit in these countries fell by about \u00c2\u00be percent of GDP last year, bringing the cumulative deficit decline to 3 percent of GDP since budget shortfalls peaked in 2009. This is good news. Indeed, in some countries deficits have fallen to the point where debt ratios have already begun to decline, and in several others debt ratios have stabilized. But there is another group of countries'which unfortunately contains some of the very largest economies'where debt ratios are continuing to rise rapidly or have stabilized but at very elevated levels. Many of these countries will need to undertake significant deficit reduction in the coming years to return debt ratios to more sustainable levels, and even those countries where debt ratios have stabilized or started falling will need to commit to keeping their fiscal positions strong for many years to return public debt to safer levels. In some countries, a few other resolutions would also be in order. The **United States and Japan** need to resolve to adopt and begin enacting credible medium-term plans to get their public finances back in shape. The short-term fiscal stimulus recently introduced by the Japanese authorities makes it even more imperative to tie down the longer term path for debt and deficits. And while the United States has thankfully avoided the so-called fiscal cliff, it also needs to resolve to increase the debt ceiling expeditiously (and not just for a few months). The concerns about the **impact of deficit reductions on growth** are valid, but the effect will depend on the specific design of fiscal adjustment policies, as well as on their timing. Under normal circumstances, when the government cuts spending by $1, output normally falls by less than that because some of the resources that used to be employed to produce goods and services for the public sector will be freed up to produce for the private sector, instead. But with a weak private sector, cuts in government spending are not partially offset by higher spending by households and firms. And with interest rates in many advanced economies close to zero, there is little scope for central banks to limit the impact of fiscal tightening by loosening monetary policy. That's why governments that can afford to move gradually need to be careful not to tighten policy too much now. But the current weak conditions will not last forever. As private sector balance sheets are mended and banks recover their lending capacity, private demand should pick up. When this happens, lower government demand for goods and services will be replaced in part by stronger private demand. Of course, this will require that monetary conditions remain relaxed for a long time. This is what the Fed has recently reiterated and what other central banks should do. This means that, when financing conditions allow, countries that need to tighten policy should resolve to reduce their fiscal deficits in a gradual and steady manner that avoids excessive front-loading, a position we have advocated for some time. The emphasis should be on both 'gradual'\u009d and 'adjustment'\u009d: just postponing all adjustment to the future would hardly be credible. The need to avoid excessive front loading has been recognized in many countries that are currently implementing Fund-supported adjustment programs. For example, in response to slow growth fiscal targets have been revised in both Ireland and Portugal, allowing for a more gradual pace of consolidation than would have been possible if the original deficit targets had been maintained. **Making resolutions is easy. Keeping them is hard**, even when we know they are good for us. In the current uncertain global environment, the deficit reduction that some advanced economies need to achieve will be difficult indeed. Whether reducing excessive deficits or extra bodyweight, however, gradual but steady progress is the safest and surest way to a healthier future. Here's hoping countries'and the rest of us'make good on this year's resolutions.

Many observers know that Latvia returned to strong economic growth after a severe downturn in 2008 and 2009 and a tough austerity program. In late 2012, Latvia even repaid the IMF in full, several years early. But the international consensus ends there. Critics of Latvia's economic strategy point to continuing high rates of unemployment and poverty; advocates point to the benefits of frontloading spending cuts and tax increases to lay the foundations for recovery. Each side has a point. 2008 and 2009 were traumatic years for Latvia. Unemployment surged [to over 20 percent, and poverty rates remain [high by EU standards. This is why the IMF has consistently [made the case for a strong social safety net in Latvia. **Severe downturn, then steady recovery** What happened in 2008 and 2009 needs to be seen in the context of what went wrong before. At first glance, Latvia's economic performance between 2004 and 2007'real GDP growth averaging 10 percent annually'seemed like a tour de force. But it was a steroid-fueled performance. Credit flowed freely and asset prices boomed. Average wage growth reached 20 to 30 percent _annually_, far outrunning productivity. And the government of the day spent the boom-related increases in revenue'from the cyclical perspective, at exactly the worst time. The headline fiscal deficit stayed low but the [structural fiscal position weakened. Latvia ran up massive current account deficits of over 20 percent of GDP in 2006 and again in 2007. So when the global crisis struck Latvia in 2008, the wheels came off. Latvia's response'sticking to the long-standing exchange rate peg to the euro, and implementing a fiscal adjustment of over 15 percentage points of GDP'also needs to be seen in the context of two more country-specific facts: * Latvia's financial system is already very highly 'euroized'\u009d. When Latvia requested its EU-IMF [loan in 2008, some 70 percent of bank deposits and nearly 90 percent of loans were in foreign currency, mainly euros. * In Latvia, the crash came first, and then the fiscal austerity, not the other way around. The output collapse of 2008 and 2009 [ran most of its course already in the first half of 2009. But the [massive fiscal consolidation effort began in earnest only in the second half of 2009, with the supplementary budget approved in June 2009. Since then, the [economy has been recovering steadily. Latvia stuck to its economic policy course. External and structural fiscal imbalances that had ballooned before the crisis have been brought back under control. We will know in coming months whether Latvia will qualify to adopt the euro in 2014. For a country that kept its peg to the euro even under severe strain in 2008 and 2009'and whose people earn wages and pay day-to-day bills in local currency but save, borrow, and pay for mortgages in euros'the economic case for euro adoption is strong. Latvia is stable again. But things aren't perfect. The unemployment rate has fallen to between 13'14 percent: well down from the peak, but still high even allowing for emigration. **Sustaining the recovery** Our new [paper on Latvia asks three questions: * Is Latvia's economic activity back in line with its potential? Is still-high unemployment structural or cyclical? * After years of economic policy discipline and reform efforts, what further microeconomic reforms could support sustainably higher growth? We find that Latvia still has a negative output gap of about 2\u00c2? percent of potential output. This is much closer to balance than before. Latvia swung from overheating (positive output gap) of up to 10 percent before the crisis, to a slump (negative output gap) of some 13 percent in 2009. We also estimate Latvia's rate of unemployment if the economy is neither overheating nor slumping'the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment'at around 12'13 percent. The analysis finds the rate would have been fairly steady over the past few years, even taking into account some hysteresis'that is, when unemployment persists and becomes permanent'in 2011 and 2012. This means that the high _level_ of unemployment in Latvia is largely structural (it's not about the cycle). At the same time, it is true that the _increase_ in unemployment through the crisis was largely cyclical. Why does this add up? Because when the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent in 2007, it couldn't last: the economy was badly overheating at the time. Our paper also focuses on **three areas where sectoral reforms could bear most fruit**: improving the efficiency of the legal system, including curbing abuses of the insolvency procedures; improving governance and transparency of state-owned enterprises, and upgrading the quality of vocational and higher education. The good news: the authorities also recognize the case for reform in these areas, and are planning accordingly. But implementation largely lies ahead. From the perspective of higher growth, employment, and living standards, it will be implementation that matters. A more efficient legal system would improve the business environment and promote investment. An education sector that better responds to the needs of employers would boost productivity and reduce skills mismatches. And tax-benefit reforms could promote incentives to work, consistent with a safety net that adequately protects the poorest'an IMF concern throughout the program. The policy debate on Latvia has so far tended to focus on how the country dealt with its crisis and regained its stability, at a high price. We hope more attention can now turn to how Latvia can promote economic growth in the future. But this time, growth not fueled by fiscal or financial doping, but underpinned by quality microeconomic reforms whose results can endure.

Optimism is in the air, particularly in financial markets. And some cautious optimism may indeed be justified. Compared to where we were at the same time last year, acute risks have decreased. The United States has avoided the fiscal cliff, and the euro explosion in Europe did not occur. And uncertainty is lower. But we should be under no illusion. There remain considerable challenges ahead. And the recovery continues to be slow, indeed much too slow. Put poetically: We may have avoided the cliffs. But we still face high mountains. **A year ago, we were worried about two short term risks:** We were worried that gridlock might lead to excess fiscal consolidation in the **United States**. And that firewalls in **Europe** may not be strong enough to prevent a crisis in **Spain** or **Italy**.

Still, **we have not yet turned the page**. The world recovery continues to be hampered by the need for fiscal consolidation'the reduction of government debt and deficits' and by a still weak financial system. **A brief world tour** The challenges clearly remain highest in the countries of the euro area periphery. We forecast that some countries will have another year of recession, with -1.0 percent growth in Italy, and -1.5 percent for Spain. The adjustment process is at work. Competitiveness is starting to improve, and export market shares are increasing. Sovereign spreads have decreased. Cross border imbalances have stabilized, and in some cases started to reverse. Yet, **interest rates are still too high, the required fiscal adjustment still large, and uncertainty still very much present, all leading to low demand and low output**.

Investors often pull sudden stops'they stop buying or start selling off their holdings of government bonds. But what has become apparent in recent years is that advanced economy government bond markets can also experience investor outflows, and associated runs. At the same time, some traditional and new safe haven countries have seen their borrowing costs drop to historic lows as they experience rising inflows from foreign investors. Our new research shows that advanced economies' exposure to refinancing risk and changes in government borrowing costs depend mainly on **who is holding the bonds' the demand side for government debt.** **Tracking who owns what, when and for how long can shed some light on potential risks in advanced economies' government debt markets.** **Mind the investor base** Regardless of their level of debt, some countries are more at risk of sudden investor outflows, and associated spikes in government borrowing costs, based on the risk characteristics of their investor base. Aside from standard measures of sovereign risk, such as debt-to-GDP ratios, we need to understand better the investor base for government debt, and why and how investors change their allocations. In our latest [research, we construct a publicly available [database of **government debt holdings** by six different classes of investors. We propose a new risk index that focuses on stability of investor demand, called the investor base risk index. The **index** runs from zero to 100, based on the composition of the investor base and the risk scores assigned to different investors given the way then tend to change their holdings. By this metric, countries with a high share of domestic investors, such as domestic banks and central banks, as well as foreign central banks in their investor base receive lower scores. In contrast, we assign high scores to countries whose investor base has a high share of foreign private investors as we find they are the most skittish in times of trouble. The index is especially useful when **used in combination with a supply-side risk indicator of government debt to assess the overall sovereign risk of a country.** We summarize our thinking in a two-by-two table in Figure 1. The best of all worlds is represented by Quadrant III (low debt and low investor base risk), while the worst is represented by Quadrant II (high debt and high investor base risk). [ We tested this idea by looking at how **countries fared in terms of investor base risk at end-2009** before sovereign risk emerged as an issue for some advanced economies in 2010. Our risk index shows several euro area countries were prone to a sudden stop as early as the end of 2009, before the current euro area debt problems fully came to light (Figure 2, Quadrant II). At the same time, countries with high debt and low investor base risk, which include **Germany, Japan, and the United States**, did not face similar market pressures despite their high projected levels of debt, while countries with low debt and low investor base risk, which include **Australia, Canada, and Sweden**, became the 'new safe haven'\u009d countries during this period. Although hindsight is perfect, this classification is remarkably close to how markets ended up differentiating these countries in terms of sovereign risk after 2009. **High debt, low yield puzzle explained** **Both supply and demand dynamics are driving trends on sovereign bond yields'and likely to continue to do so in the future**. We generally understand trends in supply of government debt, often measured by projected debt-to-GDP ratios in publications such as the IMF's own _World Economic Outlook_. But demand factors are more difficult to track. Also, **supply factors alone do not explain well recent changes in government bond yields.** For instance, highly indebted governments like Japan and the United States still experience some of the lowest government bond yields among advanced economies. **Our index can explain why some countries are able to sustain much higher levels of debt without pressure from financial markets.** For example, despite continued worries about Japan's fiscal outlook, demand for Japanese government bonds, in particular from domestic banks, has been strong and bond yields have been stable'a fact captured by our risk index. That suggests that in cases where the investor base risk is low, high debt-to- GDP levels may matter less, as the likelihood of a run by sovereign investors is also less. **In that respect, our index suggests that Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States may be in the same category as Japan, although for a different reason**: those countries rank low in the index mainly because of the high share of foreign central banks and domestic central banks in their investor base. At the same time, too much reliance on domestic financial institutions as an investor base may result in inflationary pressures or stronger sovereign-bank interdependence, potentially curbing credit channels to private sector and thus hurting growth. So it seems likely that demand side factors will continue to play an important role in sovereign debt markets.

We also need to do more to secure our future. Beyond our current economic and financial problems, there are long-term issues that we all know about, but that get too little attention in an era when policymakers are so fully engaged in slogging away at more immediate problems. Unfortunately, long-term issues unaddressed today will become crises tomorrow. So we had better lengthen our focus, see what looms on the horizon, and do more to steer the global economy in a better direction. #### Die Another Day Policymakers around the world have been hard at work mending their economies. In the coming year, they will need to carry on supporting growth while correcting imbalances by: * providing accommodative **monetary policy**; * striking a balance on **fiscal adjustment**'tightening where possible but taking care to support short-term growth; * completing **banking sector** cleanup and making financial systems safer; * implementing **reforms** to boost productivity and growth potential. A rebalancing of global demand toward dynamic markets, including emerging economies, should also help complement all of these efforts. These are the core issues of the day and we will all focus on them. But we must also put several long-term issues onto our action agenda. #### The World Is Not Enough Some pundits today look at the world in the wake of the financial crisis and predict a future of de-globalization. More likely, just as early auto travel adapted to accidents, we will see globalization continue but with the economic equivalent of speed limits, bumpers, and seat belts. In that world, rising standards of living will depend on all economies making the most of their potential, while integrating into the global economy in an orderly way. Over the next generation or two, the greatest untapped potential to drive global growth comes from the emerging and developing countries. While we are accustomed to thinking of the _development_ _challenge_, we need to shift our thinking to the _convergence challenge_. A top priority will be helping emerging and developing countries achieve growth trajectories that produce a sustained convergence of living standards toward rich country levels. That means modernizing economic structures and institutions, along with supportive political institutions, that are crucial to fostering growth and employment. Globalization with convergence will not be easy, as it will mean a continuation of the shifting patterns of production and demand that we have seen over the last generation bring rising living standards in emerging economies, but disruption in advanced economies. It also means adapting to new technologies and their global dispersion. In addition, all forms of policy coordination, from financial market regulation to taming externalities, such as carbon emissions and pollution, will likely grow more complex. #### Tomorrow Never Dies But that is the future we need to anticipate and to begin to prepare for. In that respect, there are three key issues that I believe warrant more attention and action than they currently get. They include: * Encourage and help countries_** modernize economic structures and institutions** _that are crucial to fostering growth and employment. * Harness the_** technology and growth nexus** _so that countries can stay competitive and create, not destroy jobs. * Face up to the**_ challenges of climate change_**. With global warming continuing, a failure to mitigate emissions will bring costs and hardships that will likely prove irreversible. _**Policymakers need to modernize and revitalize their economies** _by undertaking key structural reforms. Of course, every country is different. But some challenges affect us all, whether we live in advanced or developing economies. We know that the policy space and readiness on the part of government and society to address these issues varies widely. The challenges are particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where countries have to embark on difficult reforms aimed at boosting growth over the medium term, while also stabilizing their economies in the short term. Necessary reforms include making labor markets more responsive to the needs of enterprises and at the same time more inclusive for employees. Policies to increase competition in product and service markets, notably in Europe but also elsewhere, are also needed. In the euro area, implementation of all the steps needed for both a fiscal and banking union should also have priority. Policymakers face the immediate challenge of finding the right balance between satisfying peoples' high expectations and carrying out tough decisions to bring public finances under control and restore the strength of weakened financial systems. _**Technological change** _is profoundly affecting the relationship between people and their contribution to a country's economic growth. One can only marvel at the spread of mobile computing and at all that you can now accomplish away from your desk. But technology is also driving business models, both expanding possibilities and directing decisions on costs savings and investment strategies. As we look at what pervasive computing means for our economies and for our lives, countries need to find the right balance, investing in technology to stay competitive but dealing with the implications for wages and jobs. Expert analysis has concluded that _**climate change and global warming** _pose real risks to economic performance, especially for some of the countries least able to deal with it, including by increasing the number and frequency of major weather events. Such events often come at great human and economic cost. Hurricane _Sandy_ is a reminder of how damaging such events can be, with its costs climbing close to $70 billion for the damage done to New York and New Jersey alone. If hurricanes of such devastation become common, even a country like the United States would see serious economic and fiscal implications from Mother Nature, likely making an already grim budget picture worse. Important steps to deal with the climate challenge include ending fossil fuel subsidies in all countries and implementing strong, credible carbon pricing to encourage conservation and the use of cleaner fuel around the globe (and provide a much-needed contribution to sounder public finances). Newer technologies may also be helpful. Progress in this area has been much too slow. #### A Quantum of Solace We can manage a bright future if everyone'governments, civil society, and the private sector 'gets to work now. While it is possible that these long term issues mean a more unstable outlook going forward, complicating the already difficult tasks at hand, it is not inevitable. Together, we can make more of our economic potential, including through new technologies, and we can coordinate to achieve sustained and balanced growth. At the start of a new year, it's time for us to look up and look ahead.

Like firms in other high-performing emerging markets in Asia, companies in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (the 'LA5'\u009d) have benefited from abundant external financing, strong domestic credit, and generally robust demand growth. These favorable conditions have resulted in robust corporate profitability and valuation, reasonably contained debt ratios, and lower short-term maturity exposures than those observed in other emerging markets. But some vulnerabilities are starting to build up. **Learning from Asia** Nearly 15 years ago, the failure of large private firms unleashed a deep economic and financial crisis in [Asia, even though prior to the crisis their economic fundamentals were strong. Even today, this event still serves as a stark reminder of the fact that firms matter'as they can act as a source or a magnifier of adverse shocks. The Asian experience also shows that the boom episode preceding the crisis gave rise to vulnerabilities in the corporate sector. When firms' assets become overvalued, they can borrow too much based on inflated collateral. In addition, abundant capital inflows can raise foreign currency exposures in unhedged firms. In light of this experience, gauging the financial strength of the corporate sector in the LA5 countries, especially given the still uncertain global environment, is important. **Looking at the data** But assessing the strength of a country's corporate sector is not easy'especially because of significant [data gaps. The best alternative is to use information available for a subset of large firms'those that are publicly traded, which have relatively stricter reporting standards. Using this sample can still provide valuable insights, since large firms tend to be 'systemic'\u009d'that is, they are sufficiently large to impose severe costs on the wider economy once they become affected by adverse shocks. Our recent [study'based on publicly-traded firm-level balance sheet data'takes an in-depth look at the financial strength of private (nonfinancial) firms in the LA5 countries based on a range of indicators, such as debt burden, maturity exposure, liquidity, collateral, and profitability. **A more sobering picture** Data for firms for the LA5 countries suggest that some vulnerabilities may be creeping up. The 'red flags'\u009d come from a hike in leverage'as measured by the debt-asset and debt-sales ratios of firms'since the Lehman crisis. The higher debt-sales ratios are especially stark for the wholesale trade and the transport and utilities sectors. Debt-asset ratios have risen as well, but they remain at more manageable levels. Profitability has been moderating nearly across the board, as are the liquidity and collateral buffers. On the upside, LA5 firms in all sectors have improved markedly the maturity composition of their debt, taking advantage of the soft financing conditions they have been facing in recent years, At the country level, the picture also shows a gradual pick up in the debt burden. In Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, averages for the debt-sales ratios have lingered around the 100 percent mark. Debt-asset ratios also have trended up since 2008, although they are at more reasonable levels. Risks are moderated by across-the-board reductions in the short-term maturity exposures. In most countries, firms have kept their liquidity buffers, but are reducing their holdings of collateral. Profitability has declined in Brazil and Chile, but picked up significantly in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. On balance, these rising debt ratios and moderating buffers imply that firms in LA5 countries are more vulnerable to a sudden stop in credit today than they were before the Lehman crisis. Specifically, if financing were to dry up sharply'making debt rollover difficult'the share of firms in the sample at risk of not being able to repay their debt on time would be equal or greater today than it was in 2007. **Keeping an eye on risks** What can be done to keep corporate vulnerability in check? We find that greater availability of bank credit lessens vulnerability, although a rapid increase in borrowing from abroad can actually raise it. We also find that, on average, the probability that firms will be unable to generate enough cash flow to repay their debts increases when the currency depreciates. However, this vulnerability is greatly reduced in countries where the exchange rate regime is more flexible, since that flexibility entices firms to hedge and avoid excessive exchange rate bets. The risks posed by abundant capital inflows to the corporate sector may be mitigated with [macroprudential tools'such as measures targeted to moderate borrowing in foreign currency (say, through prudent loan-value ratios), or geared toward boosting provisions, capital buffers, and liquidity requirements in the domestic financial system. These tools can ensure that credit markets are resilient to sharp reversals in external funding and can continue to provide a healthy level of domestic credit to firms during times of global stress. But more importantly, increasing the availability of data on the assets and liabilities of firms would be critical to monitor risks and adapt needed policies and regulations in a timely manner.

I return with increased optimism, as much of Latin America continues its impressive transformation that started a decade ago. The region remains resilient to the recent bouts in global volatility, and many countries continue to expand at a healthy pace. An increasing number of people are escaping the perils of poverty to join a growing and increasingly vibrant middle class. During my visit to [Colombia and [Chile next week, I will talk to policymakers, business leaders, students, and civil society about the challenges of sustaining this transformation. Both countries are emblematic of the region'not only of its recent success but also of its desire to continue to move forward. They are aware that in our increasingly interconnected and changing world, economies must be resilient and adaptable. They are also working to make their societies more productive and competitive, and ensuring that the economic gains are shared more equally. **Not an easy year** This year, uncertainties about the path of policies in advanced economies have weighed on growth in many emerging economies. Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed from 4\u00c2? percent in 2011 to an estimated 3\u00c2? percent this year. Although this slowdown also reflected domestic factors in some cases, it serves as a reminder that the region is not immune to shifting global tides. The region is projected to expand by about 4 percent in 2013, broadly in line with its potential. Commodity exporters in the region continue to be supported by the double tailwinds of high commodity prices and favorable external financing conditions. However, the global recovery remains fragile and subject to serious downside risks. Policy slippages in advanced economies could weigh on Latin America. A fiscal cliff-spurred recession in the United States would affect the region, particularly Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, given their strong trade, tourism, and remittances ties. A deepening of the crisis in Europe could heighten risk aversion and lead to a sudden drop in external financing flows. And continued robust growth in Asia in the medium term is critical to support the region's strong commodity exports. **Policies to strengthen resilience** Against this backdrop, the region must continue to work hard to enhance resilience. Tailwinds can quickly turn into headwinds should global risks materialize. * With debt levels higher and fiscal balances generally weaker than before 2008, the priority in many countries remains to strengthen their fiscal positions. Policymakers should avoid the temptation to use fiscal policy to support demand, especially in countries where private domestic demand remains very strong. But, let me be clear, we are not advocating fiscal consolidation at all cost. If circumstances change, if global risks materialize and private demand slows sharply, fiscal stimulus could be considered in countries not facing financing constraints. Meanwhile, monetary policy should continue to act as the first line of defense in case of slowing demand. * Large and potentially volatile capital flows continue to present a challenge to the region. The Fund's thinking on this issue has evolved, and a recently released document underscores that a variety of tools could be useful in dealing with [capital flows. Managing the risks associated with inflow surges or disruptive outflows requires not only sound macroeconomic policies, but also strong financial supervision and regulation, and in some cases capital flow management measures. With credit growing briskly in many countries of the region, policymakers need to balance remaining vigilant to financial sector excesses, while harnessing the benefits of capital flows. **Making growth more inclusive** Looking beyond these near-term challenges, building a vibrant and stronger Latin America will require boosting its productivity and competitiveness, a longstanding weakness in the region. To achieve this, the region will need to invest more in high-quality infrastructure and education, to improve its tax and regulatory structure, and to diversify its exports. I know that these reforms are not easy, but they are necessary. And since these reforms take time to bear fruit, countries should act now that conditions are generally favorable. But it is not enough to grow more quickly. The region must ensure that the benefits of growth are shared more broadly. More equal growth is also more lasting growth. Latin America has made significant progress in improving social outcomes. But more needs to be done. In particular, better access to quality **education** is necessary to reduce inequality, as well as to ensure that young people have the skills and knowledge to compete in our increasingly integrated and rapidly changing world. I am eager to discuss these issues with policymakers from Chile and Colombia, and more broadly from the region at the meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in Vi\u00c3?a del Mar, as well as with women leaders in Colombia, and students in Chile. Given its recent strong track record, my hope is for Latin America to continue to rise to the challenge of ensuring lasting prosperity and stability for all.

Almost two years since the Arab Awakening started, the future of the Middle East and North Africa is in a flux, with fledgling democracies struggling to find their way and renewed outbreaks of violence adding to the challenges the region is facing. Some are starting to worry aloud that the revolutionary path may hit a dead end. To me, a useful way to think about the present situation is that the region could end up taking any one of **three alternative paths**, as far as its economic future is concerned. We could witness either: * _**Economic deterioration**_, if squabbling over political power prevents stabilization, let alone reform; * _**Stabilization through a reassertion of vested business** **interests**_ that would offer a respite from eroding economic conditions, but condemn the region to a return to economic stagnation or at best tepid growth; * Or we could see _**a new economy emerge**_, as newly elected governments gradually find a way to end economic disruptions and undertake reforms that open the way to greater economic opportunity for their people. While the first two paths would be undesirable, they could come to pass. Needless to say, the third path of transformation would be best. No doubt the [Arab countries in transition will chart their own paths. But I strongly believe that the international community also has a role in helping them avoid the unfavorable outcomes. Let me share some thoughts on how we can provide support. #### Need for economic change When I visited [Tunisia in mid- November, President Moncef Marzouki and Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali explained to me the many challenges facing their country. It was in Tunisia that the Arab Awakening began nearly two years ago, with a self-immolation by a street vendor in December 2010. The next month, the call in Egypt for 'bread, freedom, and social justice'\u009d echoed across much of the Arab world and caught the attention of the world. 'The whole Arab world is watching Tunisia,'\u009d President Marzouki told me. 'We have to succeed'-not only for us, but for everybody else.'\u009d The mandate for change in the Middle East was not just [political' it extended deep into the economic sphere. People were calling for a say in how their countries would be governed and for greater [opportunities for prosperity and human fulfillment. If there is one fact I think sums up the problems of the region, it is that the non-oil exports of the whole region, are $365 billion, about the same as the exports of Belgium, a country of 11 million people, compared with the 400 million people who make up the Arab world. This is a crucial indicator of the nature and size of the structural adjustment problem the Arab countries in transition face. If you cannot export to the rest of the world, you are stuck serving the limited domestic market, and as we have seen, countries in the region have not been able to create the jobs to employ their rapidly [growing populations. This statistic epitomizes the problem. But ironically, it also illuminates the way forward. #### What should transition countries do? To achieve broad-based and sustainable growth, the countries of the Middle East and North Africa need to move away from state-dominated to private investment and from protected industries and rent-seeking to export-led growth and value creation. That's where the jobs will be. To unlock the region's formidable [growth potential, the private sector must become the main source of growth, which will only happen if they can access global markets, not just their home markets. So now is the time for a dynamic dialogue with political and thought leaders about their economic future, a dialogue that might lead to a roadmap and transformation strategy to channel peoples' energies toward a common goal. The process of defining the reform agenda in each country must be truly participatory and draw on the perspectives of all stakeholders. Reform plans, no matter how technically sound, cannot be imposed without broad popular understanding and acceptance. Despite the rain pummeling Tunis during my short visit, it was hard not to be optimistic given the country's obvious dynamism. Jebali himself symbolizes a fresh start: under the previous regime he spent 15 years in prison'10 of them in solitary confinement. Yet I found him serene and focused on the task of rebuilding his country. Turkey also provides an inspiring example of a Muslim country that has chosen fundamental economic reform and has become a vibrant emerging market economy with a strong and growing middle class. #### How can the international community help? When one considers the potential costs of the two undesirable paths I described earlier, and the benefits not only for the region, but for the global economy and security of the third path, it is clear that the international community should make a concerted effort to help, by providing adequate financing, trade access, and policy advice. At the IMF, for our part, we are trying to step up to the challenge. In the past year alone, we have provided a total of $8\u00c2? billion in loans for [Jordan, [Morocco, and [Yemen. We have just reached a staff-level agreement on a $4.8 billion support package with the government of [Egypt. We are helping [Tunisia through policy advice or technical assistance, and stand ready to provide financing, if needed. As in the other countries, we are providing policy advice and technical assistance, including to [Libya. But the IMF must focus on its core mission, stabilization. The MENA countries need much more, if they are to transform their economies. So, it will be very important for the international community, including the G-8 countries, regional partners such as the [Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and international and regional development banks to provide not only adequate support for stabilization, but also for capacity building, trade and investment. The European Union and the United States will need to hold out the prospect of deep market access for trade in products and services for countries that are willing to undertake fundamental reforms. Investment, including with support and enhancements from bilateral and regional partners, can help jump start growth. The invaluable expertise, coupled with investment in the private sector by the [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other financial institutions can act as trailblazers, leading investors into new sectors and markets, as happened in eastern and central Europe. Those investments will not only catalyze economic transformation, but also serve the economic and security interests of the international community. I believe one thing is clear: the region deserves our support now.

Some of them have adopted an [inflation target and use the policy interest rate as the main tool to achieve that target. **But how do central bankers know whether [monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary?** Policymakers would need to know how the current policy rate compares to a benchmark or _neutral_ rate. The neutral interest rate is the real interest rate **consistent with the economy operating at full employment and stable inflation**. If the economy is operating above its potential capacity and inflation is rising, policymakers should increase the policy interest rate above the neutral level to cool down the economy. Conversely, if the economy is operating below its full employment level, interest rates may need to be lowered below the neutral level. **Estimating neutral rates** In our [study, we estimate neutral interest rates for 10 Latin American countries (see also our [Working Paper). The neutral rate cannot be observed and there is no single best method to estimate it. Therefore, we use several different methodologies, and obtain a range of plausible values for the neutral rate for each country. Our sample includes countries that have a full-fledged inflation targeting regime (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) or have recently transitioned to it (Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Paraguay).[ We find that financially developed economies with a longer history of inflation targeting typically have lower neutral interest rates. These countries tend to have stronger economic fundamentals (for example, lower inflation uncertainty and sovereign risk premiums measured by [JP Morgan's Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spreads). A puzzling notable exception is Brazil, where the neutral rate is among the highest in emerging economies. We also find that stronger economic fundamentals and the easing of global financial conditions (reflected in lower federal funds rates) have also resulted in a downward trend in the neutral interest rates, with the recent exception of Brazil and Uruguay. **Comparing actual and neutral rates** Using our estimated neutral interest rates we find that current policy rates are close to their neutral level in several countries (Chile, Colombia, and Peru). For Brazil and Mexico we find that monetary policies remain stimulative (with actual interest rates below neutral).[ For other countries in the region our analysis suggests that Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Uruguay have lower interest rates than their neutral level. However, these results should be viewed with caution given data limitations and weaker monetary policy transmissions. Taking monetary policy decisions is a very challenging task owing to the many unknowns (such as the position of the economy in the business cycle and likely future economic shocks). It is even more challenging today given the volatile external environment. Reliable estimates of country-specific neutral rates can help central bankers in Latin America set the course for monetary policy. ", "index": 463}, {"pub": "11/7/2012", "title": "Jobs. Jobs. Jobs.

Rightly so: High persistent unemployment has major human and economic costs, from loss of morale to loss of skills. More broadly, it seems to undermine the very fabric of society.[ Against this backdrop, the theme for the IMF's 13th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference, '[**Labor Markets through the Lens of the Great Recession**,'\u009d could not be timelier. This year's conference program weaves together a number of contributions by researchers both inside and outside the IMF, aiming to shed light on those labor market issues that are central to the current economic and social landscape. **Cyclical vs. structural** [Peter Diamond, Nobel Prize winner in Economics and Professor of Economics at MIT, will give the keynote Mundell- Fleming lecture on the controversial issue of cyclical vs. structural unemployment. Peter will explore whether and how we can use the information contained in two widely used tools, the [Beveridge curve relation between unemployment and vacancies, and the matching function, which relates hires, unemployment, and vacancies. His contribution will help us understand both the usefulness but also the limits of these tools, and give clear indications on how we should extend our research in the future. The remainder of the program consists of 12 papers on key dimensions of labor markets and income distribution, and on the role of trade and financial globalization in labor market outcomes around the globe. Just to give you a flavor of what to expect, here are some of the questions that we will be discussing: * Has the relationship between employment and output growth (the so-called '[Okun law'\u009d) changed in recent years? To what extent is such a relationship stable over time and significantly homogeneous across countries? * What is the role of skills mismatch in unemployment? Is the [Beveridge curve shifting significantly over time and, if so, how do social policy (namely, unemployment insurance) and skill mismatch account for such shifts? * What is the relationship between growth and income and wealth [inequality? Do rising top income shares exacerbate economic fragility? And if so, how far should and could fiscal policy go in trying to mitigate it? * Do contractionary monetary policies systematically increase inequality in labor earnings and consumption? * How far does imperfect financial intermediation help explain fluctuations in employment and asymmetries in job creation between small and large businesses? * How large has been the impact of trade integration with large emerging markets (China, India, and others) on employment and income distribution in advanced countries? * What are the stylized facts about fast employment recovery '[miracles'\u009d? Do recoveries tend to benefit more those who lost their jobs in the first place through 'employment recalls'\u009d at the expense of new entrants in the labor force? How crucial have been labor market reforms and regulation in fostering employment recoveries? In addition to the Mundell-Flemming lecture, the conference will feature two other events. [George Akerlof ' Nobel Prize winner in Economics and Senior Advisor in the IMF [Research Department' will deliver the opening remarks to the conference, sharing his views on the nature of unemployment and main trade-offs in [job creation policies.

And unless that information is made public, citizens and their legislatures can't hold governments accountable for those decisions. **Fiscal transparency**'the public availability of timely, reliable, and relevant data on the past, present, and future state of the public finances'**is thus crucial to the foundation of effective fiscal management.** A new [paper from the IMF on fiscal transparency, accountability, and risk considers the progress we have made in opening up the 'black box'\u009d of fiscal policymaking over the past decade, the lessons of the recent crisis for current fiscal reporting standards and practices, and the steps we need to take to revitalize the global fiscal transparency effort. **Revealing governments' fiscal mysteries'how much progress have we made?** The last ten years have seen the development of improved standards for fiscal reporting, such as the International Federation of Accountants' [International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the IMF's [Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency and [Government Finance Statistics Manual. We have also witnessed steady progress in countries' adoption of those standards. For example, the paper finds that out of 188 IMF member countries, the number able to report fiscal data covering the whole of the general government has risen from 48 to 78 over the past six years. Countries have also improved the timeliness of fiscal reporting, with just over 80 countries now reporting some fiscal information on a monthly basis. At the same time, there remain serious shortcomings in governments' adherence to fiscal reporting standards, the standards themselves, and the monitoring of governments' compliance with those standards. **Let me give some examples. ** For over a decade, reporting standards for fiscal statistics and accounts have called on governments to adopt accrual-based reporting of revenues and expenditure and to publish balance sheets showing their assets and liabilities. **Today, however, only 12 countries are able to report on a full accrual basis** and only 14 report a full balance sheet including both fixed and financial assets and liabilities. At least international standards for these kinds of retrospective fiscal reports exist'**there are no such standards for budget forecasts**. It can be hard therefore to know how to interpret these forecasts or judge their credibility. Yet the budget is probably the single most important fiscal report, and certainly the one that attracts the most legislative and public attention. **Lastly, multilateral monitoring of governments' compliance with those standards needs to improve**. For example, the number of [fiscal transparency reviews conducted by the IMF has fallen from over twenty in 2002 to just one last year. And, the track record of these reviews in identifying the fiscal transparency problems that contributed to the recent crisis was decidedly mixed. **Fiscal transparency and the crisis'what have we learned?** These latent gaps in fiscal transparency standards and practices were not the main cause of the economic and financial crisis that began in 2008, but they exacerbated it in many countries. The paper looks at the ten countries that experienced the largest unanticipated increase in reported general government debt in the wake of the crisis and finds that just under one-quarter of that increase was caused by shortcomings in government's understanding of their current fiscal position. These failures in retrospective fiscal reporting were most evident in Greece where yields shot up once it became clear that the government had substantially underreported its debt and deficit. **A lack of credible information about future fiscal developments and risks** has also hindered countries' response to the crisis. Whether a government is trying to reduce its deficit or stimulate the economy, it needs reliable estimates of how its finances will evolve under current policies, the fiscal impact of any policy changes, and the risks around any central scenario. However, the paper found that only one-third of countries systematically distinguish the fiscal impact of current and new policies in their forecasts. Moreover, even among advanced countries, less than half produce the kind of fiscal risk statements required to give citizens and markets the confidence that the government's fiscal policy settings are robust to a plausible range of shocks. Finally, the fiscal adjustment process requires, in many cases, governments to set ambitious targets for reducing deficits and debt. We know from experience that governments in these circumstances are often tempted to resort to creative accounting as a way of avoiding, albeit temporarily, the tough fiscal choices implied by those targets. By way of illustration, the last four years has seen a more than ten-fold increase in the stock of government-guaranteed bonds issued by private and public financial institutions. In the vast majority of countries, the value of these guarantees is not reflected in headline measures of the government deficit or debt. A revitalized fiscal transparency effort is therefore essential to address the gaps in reporting standards and practices revealed by the crisis, inform governments' response to the crisis, and guard against a resurgence of fiscal opacity in the wake of the crisis. **Rising to the challenge'where next on fiscal transparency?** The new IMF paper considers how existing standards themselves can be improved by requiring consolidation of a broader range of public entities; recognition of a wider range of assets, liabilities, and flows; and more frequent publication of summary fiscal data. **These improvements in _retrospective_ fiscal reporting need to be matched by improvements in _prospective _fiscal reporting**. The paper therefore calls for the development of a new standard on fiscal forecasting and risk disclosure. The paper also discusses how governments can be encouraged to adopt these enhanced reporting standards. At the national level, this requires institutional reforms to promote strong domestic constituencies for fiscal transparency such as legislatures, state audit institutions, and fiscal councils. **At the regional level**, this requires improvements in fiscal surveillance of the kind being incorporated into the budget framework directives of the European Union, West African Economic and Monetary Union, and Central African Economic and Monetary Community. **At the international level**, the IMF and other technical assistance providers need to provide countries with more practical guidance in areas such as the transition from cash to accrual accounting and fiscal oversight of public corporations. Finally, the paper looks at how the IMF can do a better job of identifying problems in fiscal reporting and of helping governments solve them. We are now working to revise our own Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency and we'll soon be seeking public comment on our ideas. At the same time, we're planning to revitalize the fiscal transparency evaluations that we produce on countries' compliance with the Code. We want to make sure these reports are tailored to the particular needs of each country and look not only at the quality of government's processes and procedures but also assess the extent to which reported debt and deficit numbers reflect underlying fiscal reality. There's a lot of work to be done, and it's important we get it right.

This has led to concern that the rise could result in higher inflation and hurt the most vulnerable. [ Two points to note are that the recent increase in food prices has been **less acute than the two previous episodes** (in mid-2008 and early 2011), and features important differences across [commodities. For example, while the price of **soybeans**, **corn** and **wheat** are up sharply, coffee and sugar prices are down. Market projections suggest that corn, soy, and wheat prices will stay high through end-2012, but then decline gradually as supply conditions normalize. #### #### Watching out for inflation The impact on domestic inflation in [Latin America and the Caribbean of the latest food price shock is beginning to be felt, although the pass- through to core (or underlying) inflation has been relatively limited thus far. Monetary authorities need to remain **vigilant**, however, as the impact of global food price shocks on [inflation and inflation expectations can be significant, and often operate with a lag. Countries with weaker monetary policy frameworks should be particularly alert and be **ready to act decisively** in view of their historically high pass- through from global to domestic food prices, and from domestic food prices to core inflation (for more detail, see our previous [research). Wage restraint will be required in countries with pegged exchange rate regimes or [dollarized economies. [ #### Uneven impact The impact on the balance of payments of the higher food prices is also likely to differ across the region. While Southern Cone countries (which export soybeans, corn, and wheat) stand to benefit the most from the recent spike in food prices, the Caribbean, a large food importer, stands the most to lose. Central America also will be adversely affected even though it is a net food exporter, because it imports corn and wheat (whose prices have risen) and exports coffee and sugar (whose prices have declined). These [food price trends are adding to the external imbalances in the Caribbean and Central America, which have been affected by high energy prices for several years. #### **Protecting the poor** Policies to **protect the poor**, which tend to spend a larger share of their income on food, will need to be accommodated within tight budgets. Countries that need to reduce public debt (the Caribbean) or regain policy space (Central America) will have to adopt those policies while keeping overall spending at a _sustainable_ level. Countries operating near potential (South America's commodity exporters) would have to reallocate spending from other areas to income support for the poor to keep fiscal positions in check. Countries could scale up well-targeted **social safety net programs** (while avoiding generalized price subsidies), and reduce taxes/tariffs on food items temporarily (while avoiding export taxes/restrictions as they generally distort production incentives and are difficult to unwind). Supply-side policies could be also considered to encourage food production (for example, **subsidies** on fertilizers and seeds), although these should be limited to clear cases of market failure in the agricultural sector.

This fiscal fury is understandable. People want to **regain the confidence they once had** about the future when the economy was booming and more of us had jobs. But after a protracted economic crisis, this will take planning, fair burden- sharing, and time itself. If history is any guide, there is no silver bullet to debt reduction. Experience shows that it takes time to reduce government debt and deficits. Sustained efforts over many years will ultimately lead to success. Most countries have made [significant headway in rolling back fiscal deficits. By the end of next year in more than half of the world's advanced economies, and about the same share of emerging markets, we expect deficits 'adjusted for the economic cycle'to be at the same level or lower than before the global economic crisis hit in 2008. But with a sluggish recovery, efforts at controlling debt stocks are taking longer to yield results, particularly in advanced economies. [Gross public debt is nearing 80 percent of GDP on average for advanced economies'over 100 percent in several of them'and we do not expect it to stabilize before 2014-15. So what can governments do to ease the pain and pave the way for successful debt reduction? I would highlight **two** key premises that governments must meet for fiscal consolidation to succeed. * First, **governments need to put together a credible medium-term plan and stick to it**. This plan should be based on structural (not nominal) targets to allow flexibility in response to the economic cycle. Such plans are a vital ingredient when it comes to restoring confidence. For most countries, this means tackling the thorny issue of entitlement reform. * Second, **governments need to ensure that fiscal adjustment is fair and carried out in a transparent manner**. Spending cuts and tax raises that people perceive as unfair are unlikely to be sustainable. Let me elaborate on both. ##### Restoring confidence Adjustment to restore fiscal sustainability in high-debt countries will need to be gradual and steady. The pace of consolidation should reflect the size of adjustment needs, the state of the economy, and financing constraints. As a general rule, adjustment of about 1 percentage point of GDP per year seems an appropriate pace for advanced economies over the medium term. Large advanced economies should take the lead in providing certainty. The **United States** should define a reasonable plan to reduce government debt and deficits to avoid the '[fiscal cliff.'\u009d **Japan **needs to proceed with a decisive debt reduction plan that includes both revenue and entitlement reform. The recently enacted consumption tax hike will slow debt accumulation, but not arrest it. In the **[euro area**, determined steps to implement a robust fiscal governance framework that limits moral hazard remains of the essence. A credible roadmap toward a banking union and fiscal integration will enhance necessary crisis actions. Both advanced and emerging economies **need to tackle entitlement reform**. Pension and health spending is projected to increase by over 4 percentage points of GDP in advanced economies by 2030, and by 3 percentage points in emerging markets. [Pension reforms have been widespread in the last few years, but [health care reform has been more timid, and in many countries remains the key long- term challenge for public finances. I personally worry most about getting health care spending under control'reforming health care in countries with rapidly aging populations is a complex undertaking. In contrast, pension reform, while politically difficult, is fairly straightforward'governments can address costs by increasing the retirement age and looking at contribution and benefit rates. ##### A fair plan [Income inequality tends to rise when governments need to cut debt and deficits, but this does not have to be the case. Countries should limit the painful social effects of debt reduction and build their plans to last. This means they need to tailor policies to support social equity and long-term employment. In practical terms, this means a degree of progressivity in taxation and access to social benefits. An enhancement of social safety nets should be supported by greater means-testing and monitoring. Policymakers can improve equity by fighting tax evasion, and'particularly in low-income and emerging economies'subsidy reform. In many advanced economies, including in the euro area, reviving long-term growth and boosting competitiveness will require tackling policies that have been on the books for years but don't necessarily work for a modern economy. Countries often also need to strengthen their fiscal institutions and governance to enhance the credibility of medium-term fiscal plans. #### In it for the long haul The results of the changes taking place now will take time to bear fruit. This is a frustrating truth for all those people who don't have the luxury of time. That's why it is so important for governments to make the case for reforms and to be as transparent and open as possible about their impact on the different segments of the population. Young people in particular need to be involved and their voices heard loud and clear.

Within an hour, parts of Japan's northeast coast were hit by a wall of water that swept away cars, boats, trains, buildings, roads'and thousands of lives. It was with humility and respect, then, that I visited parts of the affected area more than 18 months on, in a special event this week in and around Sendai'the Japanese city most affected by the disaster, a couple of hours by train north of Tokyo. This \"[**Sendai Dialogue**,\" cohosted by the Government of [Japan and the [World Bank, was part of the overall [IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings being held in Tokyo this week. **Disaster turned to success** I went to two areas around Sendai'the first was the Arahama Elementary School, site of a successful evacuation during the disaster. The school is still in its wrecked state'just as it was straight after the tsunami struck. Debris is strewn all over the grounds'a mangled mass of vehicles resembling more a scrap yard than a school. The corridors and classrooms inside are also in ruins. This school, however, represents a success story-because the children were evacuated straight after the quake and airlifted out by helicopter as the area was being submerged in water. The Arahama School Principal told us proudly of how the local community had come together, of the heroic efforts that had been made, and how, these days, the children of the Tohuko region are \"becoming more cheerful.\" [ The other location that I visited was the Seaside Park Adventure Field, which offered a vantage point over a disaster waste treatment area. I was told that the disaster generated some 1.35 million tons of debris from the city. As part of a three-year project, it is sorted into various categories with the aim of recycling most of it. It is a massive undertaking. No one could fail to be horrified by the scale of destruction, while being moved by the courage, determination, and collective action that the Japanese population showed in the face of this disaster. **Learning from experience** The [_Sendai Dialogue_ provided us with an opportunity to learn from Japan's experience with managing disasters and to learn how the international community can better work together to strengthen defenses, reduce risks, and lower the human and economic costs of natural disasters. Of course, dealing with disasters'physical ones anyway'is not the core business of the IMF. But we do have a role to play. The IMF may be a relatively small link in this chain, but an important one nevertheless. Small links are needed if the chain is to be kept together. [ Lagarde (right) with World Bank President Kim (center) and Japanese Finance Minister Koriki Jojima What can the IMF do in the face of natural disasters? We can provide rapid emergency financing, for one thing-we have responded to 42 cases of natural disasters since 1962. A recent example was when the IMF provided financing to [Haiti within three weeks of the earthquake that struck in early 2010. We also, of course, provide policy support'either through our regular economic oversight or through the financing of programs'helping to lay the foundation for recovery. And we also give [technical assistance to build capacity for recovery. For example, Haiti has received over 35 technical visits from us since early 2010 on topics ranging from revenue administration and financial sector reform, to exchange rate policy and improvement of statistical information. The IMF has valuable knowledge to share. A [paper released this week draws lessons from seven countries hit by natural catastrophes and how countries can strengthen their resilience to disasters. I highlighted five lessons, in particular, in Sendai: early warning of disasters; flexibility to redeploy spending rapidly; coordination between all agencies when disaster strikes; transparency in the effective use of assistance; and a growth strategy as an integral part of reconstruction and recovery. **Valuable opportunity** Natural disasters, unfortunately, will always be with us. And the costs and number of people affected by disasters continues to rise in the face of such influences as growing urbanization and environmental degradation. But the visit to Sendai was a valuable opportunity for me-and for the many others who participated in the Dialogue-to learn how we can strengthen our [defenses and better react in these emergencies. \"I just want our children to be able to hope and dream again,\" said the Principal of the Arahama school. That is a goal that I believe all 188 member countries of the IMF and World Bank share as they gather this week in Tokyo to discuss the challenges facing the global economy.

Yet our latest [assessment is that confidence is still very fragile and **risks have increased**, when compared to the IMF's last report in April. Policymakers need to do more to gain lasting stability. **The principal risk remains the euro area. **The forces of financial and economic fragmentation have widened the divide between countries at the core and the \"periphery\" of the euro zone. Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery'quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union. This has driven up funding costs to governments and banks, as well as for companies and households, and, in turn, threatening a vicious downward economic spiral. **Can this process of fragmentation be reversed? **My firm belief is yes. As recognized in our [_Global Financial Stability Report_, actions taken by the [European Central Bank have helped remove investors' worst fears. Now policymakers at both the national and euro area level will need to build on these. The stakes are high. For instance, if pressures continue, total assets of major banks in Europe could shrink by as much as $2.8 trillion, possibly leading to a contraction in credit supply in the periphery by 9 percent by the end of 2013. In a more adverse case, as illustrated in our weak policies scenario, European Union bank assets could shrink by as much as $4.5 trillion, and lead to a reduction in the supply of credit in the periphery by up to 18 percent. In contrast, a rapid move to complete policies would avoid this economic damage. **So what is needed?** 1. _Safer banks_: policymakers have made progress, including the [European Banking Authority's capital enhancement exercise, but weak banks still need to be restructured or resolved. 2. S_afer sovereigns_: through well-timed fiscal consolidation and _safer economies _through structural reforms. 3. _Strong firewalls_: The [European Stabilization Mechanism and the European Central Bank's bond purchasing program should have credible conditions so they are regarded by financial markets as real, not 'virtual.'\u009d 4. A _stronger union_: establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism is an important step that policymakers need to implement without delay. A clear roadmap to a complete banking union is required to guide market expectations and help break the pernicious link between sovereign and bank balance sheets. **A key lesson for the United States and Japan from the euro area crisis is that delaying policy adjustments until market strains become evident leads to financial turmoil and harsher economic outcomes**. Fiscal imbalances in the United States and Japan are amenable to medium-term adjustment, but a blueprint for policy actions must be developed right away. We cannot let current market conditions give rise to a false sense of security. Safe haven flows to the United States and Japan and easy monetary policies have led to record low interest rates, and have suppressed risk premia in government and corporate bond markets. Furthermore, a potential political impasse in the United States could result in a repeat of the debt ceiling strains that occurred in the summer of 2011 and a possible push over the [fiscal cliff. Policymakers and politicians should avoid both risks and put an end to these policy uncertainties. **[Japan's high sovereign debt and rising concentration of government bond holdings in the banking system are important stability risks**. We project bank holdings of government bonds could rise to about one-third of banks total assets in five years time. This would tie banks ever closer to the sovereign and potentially weakening financial stability should interest rates rise. To mitigate these effects, [macroprudential vigilance and a further strengthening of bank balance sheets and bank business models, together with much-needed fiscal consolidation. **Are emerging markets safe? **As a whole, emerging markets have navigated global risks skillfully, but they must keep up their guard. Several [central and eastern European countries are most vulnerable because they are directly exposed to European bank deleveraging pressures, while some private balance sheets are weak. Asian and Latin American emerging markets are less impacted by shocks emanating from Europe, but are not immune to adverse external spillovers. Following a period of rapid credit growth some key economies in both regions have reached the late stages of the credit cycle. These tend to be accompanied by peaking asset prices, and early indications of worsening loan quality. In the face of the global slowdown, emerging markets need to use their available policy space wisely, and address domestic vulnerabilities. Banks, policymakers and regulators have accomplished a lot, but confidence is still fragile. This is the time when governments need to complete what they have started to enhance actions already taken by central banks. The choice today is between making the necessary but tough policy and political decisions, or delaying them ' once more ' in the false hope that time is on our side. It is not.

In fact, **significant progress** in many countries has been made during the past two years in strengthening their fiscal accounts after the 2008'09 deterioration. The IMF's latest [_Fiscal Monitor_ takes stock of this progress. **Deficits are lower, and in many cases debt is too** Let me first say something about **advanced economies**, which is where the most urgent fiscal problems exist. Most advanced economies have made good progress lowering their fiscal deficits (the imbalance between spending and revenues). Deficits, adjusted for the economic cycle, fell by about \u00c2\u00be of a percentage point of GDP in 2011 and 2012, and are projected to do so by about 1 percentage point of GDP in 2013. But, as I discuss at a bit more length in our [_Fiscal Monitor_ video, deficits are not declining enough to stop the rise in public debt: countries borrow less than in the past but they still borrow quite a lot and overall their debt is increasing, including in relation to GDP. This is partly because GDP growth is low. But even here there is some progress, because even though debt ratios are still rising, they are doing so at a slower pace than in the past. These are averages, though, and they obscure a lot of important details. Let's look more closely at what advanced economies are doing. Broadly speaking, we can sort the advanced economies into **three groups**. [ The first group includes those countries with declining or stable public'debt- to GDP-ratios. The chart below shows their average deficit and increase in the debt ratio over time. The vertical axis represents the level of the deficit starting in 2007 and the horizontal axis shows the cumulative change in the debt ratio since 2007. [ For countries in the **first group**, represented by the blue line, debt and deficits initially increase. Subsequently, their deficits start to decline, but the debt ratio keeps rising. Finally, in the last stage the debt ratio starts to catch up with the deficit and begins falling, too. The **second group** consists of countries where the debt ratio hasn't started to fall yet, but is about to do so. Deficits in this group are falling, and the increase in the debt ratio is petering out, but they have not quite turned the corner on debt, which, however, remains relatively low (see the green line). The **third group** consists of countries where the fiscal imbalances are larger. In most of these countries deficits have started declining, but debt is high, or still rising, or both (see the red line). **So where do we go from here?** Many countries, particularly among those in the third group, will have to proceed with fiscal adjustment for several years. As we have underscored in the past, the necessary [speed of adjustment will depend on the size of fiscal imbalances, the degree of market pressures, and the state of health of the overall economy. In general, we continue to believe that a relatively gradual pace of fiscal adjustment is preferable, given the still persistent weakness of economic activity. In the **United States**, maintaining a gradual pace of adjustment will require avoiding the '[fiscal cliff'\u009d of automatic deficit reduction, and timely action to raise the debt ceiling. As to **emerging economies**, the _Fiscal Monitor_ underscores that, on average, their fiscal deficits and debt are well below those of advanced economies. Most of these countries will pause their fiscal adjustment in 2012 and 2013: the average fiscal adjustment in these countries, which had been sizable in 2010 and 2011, will be almost zero this year and next year. This is an **appropriate response** to the weaker global outlook, but there are several emerging economies that, over the medium term, will have to make significant efforts to reduce their still sizable deficits and debt. It is indeed significant that several emerging economies are still running very large primary deficits'so their revenues are not even sufficient to cover their non-interest expenditure'in spite of several years of historically strong growth. So when the downside risks to global growth recede, these countries will need to begin making progress again in reducing their fiscal weaknesses.

In advanced countries, growth is now too low to make a substantial dent in [unemployment. And in major emerging countries, growth that had been strong earlier has also decreased. Let me give you a few numbers from our latest projections in the October _[World Economic Outlook _released in [Tokyo. Relative to the IMF's forecasts last April, our growth forecasts for 2013 have been **revised down** from 1.8% to 1.5% for advanced countries, and from 5.8% down to 5.6% for emerging and developing countries. The downward revisions are widespread. They are however _**stronger**_ for two sets of countries-for the members of the [**euro** area, where we now expect growth close to zero in 2013, and for three of the large emerging market economies,[** China**, [**India**, and [**Brazil**. **Familiar story ** The forces at work are for the most part familiar. Let me start with the **advanced economies**. The main force pulling up growth is accommodative monetary policy. **Central banks** continue not only to maintain very low policy rates, but also to experiment with programs aimed at decreasing rates in particular markets, at helping particular categories of borrowers, or at helping financial intermediation in general. But two forces continue to pull growth down--**fiscal consolidation**, and a still [**weak financial system**. In most countries, fiscal consolidation is proceeding according to [plan. While this consolidation is needed, there is no question that it is weighing on demand, and the evidence increasingly suggests that, in the current environment, the fiscal multipliers are large--larger than in normal times. The **financial system is still not functioning efficiently**. In many countries, more so in Europe than in the United States, [banks are still weak, and their position is made worse by low growth. As a result, many borrowers still face tight borrowing conditions. And more seems to be at work than these mechanical forces, call it a general feeling of **uncertainty about the future**. Worries about the ability of European policymakers to control the euro crisis, worries about the failure of U.S. policymakers to agree so far on a fiscal plan, worries about the ability of [Japanese policymakers to reduce their budget deficit further-all appear to play an important role, although one which is hard to nail down. Let me turn to **emerging market and developing economies**. A constant theme of our IMF forecasts has been the degree to which the world economy is [**interconnected**, be it through trade or through capital flows. And this time is no exception. Low growth in advanced countries is affecting emerging and developing economies through **exports**. As was the case in 2009, trade channels are surprisingly strong, with, for example, lower exports accounting for most of the decrease in growth in **China**, and through supply chains, much of the decrease in growth in **Asia**. Alternative _risk-off_ and _risk-on_ episodes, triggered by progress and regress on policy actions, are triggering volatile [capital flows, in particular to Asia and to Latin America. Adding to these are some home grown woes, policy uncertainty in **India** affecting domestic demand, tighter policies in **Brazil** in response to an earlier boom. We do not see these developments as signs of a hard landing in any of these countries. Indeed, we see positive policy measures being taken in all three countries. But they suggest** lower growth for some time**, lower than we have seen in the recent past. **What should be done? ** The general strategy is clear. Continue with accommodating [**monetary policy**, which is a very powerful force for growth, and limit the adverse effects of the brakes holding things back. Continue with steady **[fiscal consolidation**; our advice still holds: [_not too slow, not too fast_. Continue to **repair the financial system**. Decrease policy uncertainty. In other words, deliver fiscal consolidation and maintain growth. In the short run however, the main issue continues the state of the **euro area**, and this is what I shall concentrate my remaining remarks on. Over the past few months, it is clear that there has been **an important change in attitudes in the euro area**, and the realization that an ambitious architecture must be put in place. The lessons of the past few years are now clear: [euro area countries can be hit by strong shocks. Weak banks can considerably amplify the adverse effects of these shocks. And, if it looks like the sovereign itself might be in trouble, sovereign/bank interactions can further worsen the outcome. Thus a **new architecture** must aim at reducing the amplitude of the shocks in the first place; at putting in place a system of transfers to soften the effects of the shocks. It must aim at moving the supervision, the resolution, the recapitalization process of banks to the euro level. It is good to see these issues being seriously explored, and some of these mechanisms being put together. In the short term however, **more immediate measures are needed**. [**Spain** and [**Italy** must follow through with adjustment plans which reestablish competitiveness and fiscal balance, and maintain growth. To do so, they must be able to recapitalize their banks, if needed, without adding to their sovereign debt. And they must be able to borrow at reasonable rates. Most of these pieces are in the process of falling into in place, and if the complex puzzle can be rapidly completed, one can reasonably hope that the worst might be behind us. If uncertainty is indeed partly behind the current slowdown, and if the adoption and implementation of these measures decrease it, things may turn out better than our forecasts, not only in Europe, but also in the rest of the world. The case for an _upside scenario_ is a bit stronger than it has been for a while.

[Youth unemployment and long-term unemployment are at alarming levels. The number of unemployed people is nearly [16 million higher today than in 2007 among countries where labor markets are tracked regularly by the IMF. Much of this increase has been in advanced economies (Chart 1). The need to tackle the unemployment crisis in these economies is self-evident. But what is to be done? [ In the near-term, **a growth strategy is the best [jobs strategy**. Policies that restore growth in advanced economies will also put people back to work in these countries. And the growth spillovers to emerging markets and developing economies will boost jobs there as well. Put differently, the human costs'in terms of increased unemployment'of making bad policy choices are immense.** ** **The unemployment costs of slower growth** To illustrate the consequences of making bad policy choices in advanced economies consider the following scenario. Suppose that overall growth in these economies slips from the current consensus range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent in 2012-13 to just below 1 percent this year and -0.5 percent next year, as some observers fear. A [template developed by IMF staff makes it easy to quantify the unemployment consequences of this drop in growth. Instead of the slow decline in unemployment rates we have seen over the past year, unemployment will shoot up to nearly 9 percent, an increase of 1.2 percentage points. To put this in terms the person on the street can easily understand, 5 \u00c2? million more people will be unemployed in the advanced economies from this fall in growth (Chart 2). [ The fall in growth in advanced countries will also raise unemployment in emerging markets and developing countries. Using the IMF's estimates of growth spillovers and employment-growth [linkages, the unemployment rate in emerging markets and developing economies will inch up by \u00c2? percentage point. This would add over 3 million people to the ranks of the unemployed in these countries. **Avoiding a lost generation** Our work with the [ILO documents the enormous personal and social costs from unemployment. Workers laid off in a recession suffer long-term loss of earnings, even once re-employed. Job and income loss has an adverse effect on productivity, health and mortality of the unemployed, and on school performance and future income of their children. High and prolonged unemployment also leads to loss of faith in public institutions. Restoring growth will help make a dent in youth unemployment. Though the average level of [youth unemployment varies across countries due to structural factors, in most advanced countries youth unemployment is also very responsive to growth. Chart 3 illustrates this strong association for two countries, the United States and Spain, that have experienced a surge in youth unemployment over the past few years. [ **Policies to foster growth** In short, t**here is an urgent need to implement policies, particularly in advanced economies, to secure the global recovery****. **These policies were laid out in a speech by our Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, at the [Peterson Institute: '\u00aa **Central banks** have announced the right steps. In contrast to the mistakes by central banks that led to the Great Depression, let's hope that recent actions by the major central banks pull us firmly out of the Great Recession. '\u00aa **Europe** is clearly where further action is most urgently needed. We need implementation of announced actions on the firewall, the banking union, and the fiscal union. '\u00aa In the **United States**, the immediate need is for actions to keep the country from plunging off a '[fiscal cliff'\u009d'reducing growth by as much as 2 percent. These actions in advanced economies would not only restore growth and bring back jobs in these countries, they would also help the jobs outlook in emerging markets and low-income countries. Of course, even after we surmount these near-term challenges, the need for a more durable model for long-term growth and job creation will remain. We have a long road ahead but first we need to clear the roadblocks to the near-term recovery.

Although the intentions of policymakers are clear and positive, the system remains precarious. Our[ new study presents an **interim report card** on progress toward a safer financial system. Overall, there is still a long way to go. **How we measure progress** In our [study, we first tried to pay attention to those features of financial systems related to the crisis'the large dominant, highly interconnected institutions, the heavy role of nonbanks, and the development of complex financial products for instance'features that need to be addressed in some way. To do this we needed to construct measures of these features in a way that would allow us to gauge how well the reforms are working toward changing them. We looked at a lot of data, but we focus on **three types of features.** * The extent to which financial intermediation is market based'the hallmark trait of the United States, with a big nonbank financial sector, active capital markets and banks conducting activities other than borrowing and lending. * Features related to the size and scope of different financial activities within a country'like the size and concentration of its banking system and how connected certain parts of the financial system are, through say, interbank markets. * Measures about how connected the financial system is to the rest of the world through banking systems and the importance of the country in global markets The next thing we did is try to tie the reform agenda to how it could reasonably be expected to alter these chosen financial structures. **Good effort, but requires follow through** So, are the reforms moving the structures in the right direction'to a safer financial system?** Our answer so far is: 'somewhat, but not enough.'\u009d** We do not yet see the impact of the reforms; they have long implementation lags and the crisis is ongoing. There are elements, such as new[ international banking rules known as Basel 2.5 and the market's anticipation of the [Basel III implementation that are promising: many banks hold more capital and have begun to divest themselves of activities they view as less profitable. However, the [basic financial structures that we found problematic before the crisis are still with us: financial systems are still overly complex, banking assets are highly concentrated, with strong domestic interlinkages, and the too-important-to-fail issues are unresolved. As some activities become costly, some banks will get out of those businesses, but others with enough scale economies will stay in, making these activities even more concentrated'the fixed income, currency, and commodities trading business line is one such activity. The good news is that [globalization has not been seriously harmed, except for in crisis-hit economies in [Europe. But this also means that in the absence of proper policies, bad outcomes from one country can easily affect the financial system in another. **What to do?** **So why do we see so little progress and what should we do about it?** We have to recognize that some regions are still in a crisis and measures to prevent deeper financial system distress, and those to bolster nascent economic growth, remain in place. The recent introduction of further central bank efforts along these lines'QE3 from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank's buying of government bonds through outright monetary transactions, and similar quantitative easing from the Bank of Japan'attests to the need for ongoing crisis-fighting efforts. While these need to be in place, this is also the time to think about their inadvertent side-effects on financial stability. Some of the cleansing of the financial system has not yet taken place, preventing a reboot to safety. Even if the needed restructuring had taken place, financial structures tend to move slowly and the reform agenda has built in rather generous implementation schedules, in part to allow the economy to recover. So we want to emphasize that while we cannot definitively say financial systems are safer than four years ago, we want to emphasize the 'somewhat'\u009d part of the answer. By taking stock of all the regulatory reforms to date we can see** some [areas that still need to be addressed.** These areas include: * More discussion on what it takes to break the 'too-important-to-fail'\u009d conundrum, including a global level discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on **business models**. We can already see that both the Volcker Rule in the United States, which aims to force banks to divest their trading businesses, and the Vickers commission proposals in the United Kingdom, which would ring fence retail banking from investment banking activities, will have effects beyond their respective jurisdictions and a global perspective is sorely needed. * Further progress on **recovery and resolution planning** for large institutions, especially cross-border resolution. * Better monitoring and, if needed, a set of prudential standards for** nonbank financial institutions** posing systemic risks within the so-called shadow-banking sector; and * Careful thought about how to encourage **simpler** financial products and simpler organizational structures. The success of the current and prospective reforms depends on **enhanced supervision**, the political will to implement regulations, incentives for the private sector to adhere to the reforms, and the resources necessary for the task of making the financial system simpler and safer. Policymakers need to press ahead. We are not encouraging a sprint, but simply a brisk, purposeful walk toward the goal of a safer financial system.

For example, the Congressional Budget Office [estimates that after-tax income almost tripled for the **top 1 percent** of households between 1980 and 2007, but grew only 22 percent for the bottom 20 percent. Recent research has focused on the link between [income inequality and growth, but less attention has been paid to the link between inequality and savings. So together with a few colleagues we have looked at how income distribution is linked to saving behavior. **Saving rates matter** because they are an important factor for the U.S. economic outlook. The decline in the saving rate in the years leading up to the crisis (from 10 percent of after-tax income in 1980 to 1.5 percent in 2005) is the mirror image of the unsustainable boom in consumer spending during the bubble years. Following the crisis, sharp losses in the values of houses and financial assets, as well as difficulties in obtaining new credit, forced American families to save more and rebuild their wealth. The ensuing rise in the saving rate, which stood at 4 percent in the second quarter of 2012, has been an important reason why the recovery from the 2008'09 recession has been sluggish. Therefore, our [study looked at which types of households drove the aggregate saving rate down before the crisis and those that drove it up afterwards, so as to improve our ability to assess the potential for future U.S. growth. **Saving patterns _before_ the crisis** To analyze individual household behavior, we used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a well-established dataset that collects data from the same households over time. Our key finding is that that households with consistently lower income growth experienced larger declines in their saving rates and a larger rise in their mortgage debt before the crisis. We also find that these types of households contributed significantly to the overall decline in the saving rate. For instance, the households with the bottom third of income growth over 1999'2007 accounted for half of the decline in the overall saving rate over the same period. This finding is surprising because economic theory would predict that households save less when their income falls temporarily, but not when the fall is highly persistent. By contrast, we don't find a large decline in the saving rates of families with consistently lower income levels; their saving rates have always been lower than the saving rates of higher income families. Our results suggest that households with disappointing income growth attempted to preserve their living standards in the boom years by tapping into their housing equity. Their decisions did not anticipate the impending correction in house prices, the weaker economy, and lower incomes.The easy availability of home equity financing allowed households with low income growth to at least temporarily 'keep up with the Joneses'\u009d; in other words, consumption inequalities remained smaller than income inequalities. With the subsequent housing crash, those households already suffering from lowest income growth found themselves more vulnerable, with high levels of debt. Another interesting finding is that the decline in saving rates was larger for households with bottom third of income growth than for those who experienced the top third of house price increases. On the basis of this finding, it seems worth examining further whether the decline in the saving rate prior to the crisis reflects more the declining opportunities'grasping for the last straw to prevent declining living standards'rather than the story of winners in the 'housing lottery'\u009d consuming their windfalls. **Saving patterns _after_ the crisis** How did households fare after the crisis? We found that those more dependent on housing wealth and those with higher debt levels on the eve of the crisis indeed raised their savings sharply after the crisis. Yet, as this sharp correction started from very depressed and even negative saving rates, these households have not yet made meaningful progress in reducing debt and repairing their balance sheets. Hence, these households may face grim future consumption prospects. Taken together, our results do suggest that the lower income growth for segments of the income distribution was linked to the drop in saving rates and growing indebtedness of American families. Moreover, households that entered the crisis with a more precarious wealth situation have made limited progress in rebuilding their net worth (the difference between household financial and nonfinancial assets and their debt) by actively saving out of their incomes. Recent [data on household finances indeed show that at least half of the American families had lower net worth (in inflation-adjusted terms) in 2010 than they did two decades ago (the median American family in 2010 had a net worth of $77,000, compared with $126,000 in 2007 and $79,000 in 1989). The data also shows that the share of the population that saved any of their income dropped from 54.6 percent to 52 percent between 2007 and 2010. Unless their incomes and house prices pick up robustly, many households will need sustained levels of higher savings to rebuild wealth, making it less likely for the [American consumer to drive U.S. growth.

Elliott In response to the global crisis, policymakers around the world are instituting the broadest reform of financial regulation since the Great Depression. **Some in the financial industry claim the long-run economic costs of these global reforms outweigh the benefits. But our [new research strongly suggests the opposite'the reforms are well worth the money.** Granted, just as adding fenders, safety belts, airbags, and crash avoidance features can make cars slower, we know that additional safety measures can slow down the economy in years when there is no crisis. The payoff comes from averting or minimizing a disaster. Five years after the onset of the current crisis, we sadly know all too well the cost in terms of economic growth, so the potential gains in avoiding future crises are very large. **[Our study finds that the likely long-term increase in credit costs for borrowers is about one quarter of a percentage point in the United States and lower elsewhere**. This is roughly the size of one small move by the Federal Reserve or other central banks. A move of that size rarely has much effect on a national economy, suggesting relatively small economic costs from these reforms. **What we looked at** How did we reach these conclusions? We examined the likely long-term impacts on credit costs from: * the increased capital and liquidity requirements in the new international rules known as Basel III ; * the major reforms in the way derivatives markets operate; and * higher taxes and fees to be charged to the financial industry. We focused on these as the reforms with the largest effect on credit pricing. Other reforms will also matter, such as securitization reforms and extending the perimeter of financial regulation. We believe however that the combined effects of the reforms we studied will capture the significant majority of the total impact. Our analytical framework **The central framework for our analysis is simple**. Lenders have to earn enough on their loans to compensate for the after-tax cost of the capital they put at risk; the rest of the funding they use to make the loan; their expected losses from borrowers who do not repay; and their administrative expenses. One offset would come from excess profits on non-lending business associated with the lending relationship. The areas of reform we studied directly affect the cost of capital, the average funding cost, and taxes. Banks can then respond to these higher costs by passing them along, accepting a lower return, or offsetting the costs by reducing expenses or taking other actions. **[Our study extends previous analyses in two major ways.** **First**, we emphasize the importance of starting with the right baseline. Most studies have implicitly attributed all costs for the adjustments in the financial system since the crisis to Basel III and the other new financial regulations. This ignores the certainty that banks would have substantially raised their levels of capital and liquidity in response to the demands of creditors, shareholders, and other constituencies even if there were no changes to regulation. We explicitly estimate the levels that financial markets would likely have demanded on their own, and use this as the starting point to determine the additional effects from the regulatory changes. **Second**, most studies over-estimate the effects of the increased safety margins by assuming the only adjustments would be through increased credit pricing or decreased availability. However, like every other industry under pressure, banks will reduce their expenses over time, in response to the squeeze on profit margins, and investors in banks will accept modestly lower returns in recognition of the greater safety of their investments in financial institutions. For example, a big trading loss or loan default has a smaller per share cost when there are more shares as a result of higher required capital levels. **Our findings** We estimate, based on a series of calculations explained in our paper that, in our base case, that long-term U.S. credit prices would rise by 0.28 percentage points. This consists of a gross effect of 0.68 points, offset by 0.20 points of benefits from lower required returns to investors, 0.15 points of expense reductions, and 0.05 points of other actions. Ignoring these offsets, as many previous analyses have done, leads to a significant overstatement of the ultimate impact on consumers and businesses. We estimate even lower net effects on credit pricing in Europe (0.18 points) and Japan (0.08 points). It is important to note that our analysis looks at the long-term, and therefore does not take account of transitional economic costs 'such as the potentially high cost if large amounts of capital need to be raised by banks simultaneously' that may be quite significant in early years, but would be outweighed by the benefits over time. Nor does it reflect the lingering near-term effects of the financial crisis and the impact of the current crisis in Europe, which make credit substantially more difficult to obtain and more expensive in many countries. These are not the result of financial reform. The combination of these effects may well produce short-run swings in credit pricing and availability that are considerably larger than our long-term results. We have also assumed that the financial regulations will be implemented in ways that do not unnecessarily create extra costs beyond those inherent in the higher safety margins. In the long run, any such implementation mistakes are likely to be corrected. Banks and other financial institutions will continue to adjust, with considerable pain, to the new reforms, but the long-term effects on borrowers and on the economy should be relatively limited compared to the large potential benefits from reducing the damage from future crises.

Bakker and [Christoph Klingen With all eyes on the euro area, it is easy to forget that only a few years ago the emerging economies of Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, went through a deep economic and financial crisis. This crisis is the topic of a new [book that we will introduce to the public this week in Bucharest, London, and Vienna. One lesson is that your best chance to prevent deep crises is forcefully addressing booms before they get out of hand. Another is that even crises that look abysmal can be contained and overcome' policies to adjust the economy and international financial support do work. In the half decade leading up to the crisis, easy global financial conditions, confidence in a rapid catch-up with western living standards, and initially underdeveloped financial sectors spawned a tremendous domestic demand boom in the region. Western banking groups bankrolled the bonanza, providing their eastern subsidiaries with the funds to extend the loans that fueled the domestic boom. Economic growth was impressive, but underneath there was much to worry about. Current account deficits were as high as 15-25 percent of GDP in the Baltic countries and Bulgaria; private sector credit surged, much of it denominated in foreign currency; housing prices boomed; and non tradable sectors, such as construction, became bloated. Governments also contributed to the problem, using buoyant taxes to fund rapid spending growth. While headline fiscal balances looked good, the underlying health of public finances deteriorated rapidly. The crisis in emerging Europe was an accident waiting to happen. Time was up when Lehman Brothers defaulted in September 2008. As banking groups in Western [Europe came under pressure, new funding for the subsidiaries in emerging Europe stopped. This pulled the rug out from under credit and domestic demand booms'just when the collapse of global trade pummeled the region's exports. The economy went into a tailspin, housing prices collapsed, and unemployment surged. The region's economy contracted by 6 percent in 2009, but that is an average: some countries experienced recessions comparable to the Great Depression in the United States, though some with less extreme precrisis booms, more policy space, and better crisis management escaped more lightly. But it could have been worse had governments not moved quickly to stabilize their financial systems and get their public finances back under control. The international community committed '\u00ac100 billion of financing under IMF- supported programs to stave off regional financial meltdown. Western banks contributed by refraining from recalling previously provided financing in an effort coordinated under the [Vienna Initiative. One lesson the episode drives home is that countries are better off if they deal with domestic demand booms before they get out of hand. * Policies to fight bad economic times should not only be preserved for bad times. Taking away the punch bowl in good times helps mitigate the build-up of imbalances and creates buffers to fall back on when fortunes turn. Fiscal policy should keep a lid on expenditure growth in boom periods, even if the government's fiscal balance is in surplus and higher spending seems easily affordable. * Keeping credit growth in check is critical. It requires more effective cooperation with bank supervisors in Western Europe, where emerging Europe's banks are headquartered, and a tougher line on foreign-currency lending. * Some countries in the region, such as Poland, implemented policies in this vein; it was rewarded with avoiding a recession in 2009 and achieving healthy growth in the subsequent years. Another lesson is that determined adjustment after a crisis works. Many countries in emerging Europe implemented highly demanding adjustment policies, including reducing government debt and deficits, bank restructuring, labor cost reductions, and other measures to restore competitiveness. It is paying off. Currency and systemic banking crises were largely avoided. Growth in the region has bounced back'4\u00c2? percent in 2010-11'unemployment has started to come down; the repair of public finances and financial systems is well underway; and external flow imbalances have disappeared. Most encouraging is the renewed focus on exports. Estonia's sales abroad, for example, now account for 100 percent of GDP, up from 70 percent of GDP in 2007. Emerging Europe is not out of the woods yet. External debt is still high, fiscal repair has further to go, and the banks need to resolve a large stock of [non-performing loans. Moreover, the crisis in the euro area poses new challenges considering its tight linkages with emerging Europe. But the experience of emerging Europe should give hope to other countries that face tough adjustment challenges'including in the euro area. Risk premiums for sovereigns in emerging Europe are now often lower than those in Western Europe. Who could have imagined that in 2009? That year, emerging Europe was the sick man of Europe, but no longer.

Ostry One of the main arguments against [**capital controls** is that, though they may be in an individual country's interest, they could be multilaterally destructive in the same way that tariffs on goods can be destructive. A particular concern is that a country might impose controls to avoid necessary macroeconomic and external adjustment, in turn shifting the burden of adjustment onto other countries. A proliferation of [capital controls across countries, moreover, may not only undercut warranted adjustments of exchange rates and imbalances across the globe, it may lead in the logical extreme to a situation of financial autarky or isolation in the same way that trade wars can shrink the volume of [world trade, seriously damaging global welfare. So should multilateral considerations trump national interests? **Possible rationales for controls** To begin, it is worth reviewing some of the reasons why countries may wish to impose [controls. The first is the **exploitation of market power** (akin to the 'optimal tariff'\u009d argument in trade). By restricting inflows (or outflows, respectively), debtors (or creditors) can manipulate the (intertemporal)terms of trade (the interest rate) in their favor. Of course, what is good for the imposing country is bad for everyone else on the other side of the transaction'the terms of trade is inherently a zero-sum concept, so the exercise of market power has no multilateral justification. And although deliberate terms of trade manipulation may sound farfetched, it is worth bearing in mind that not only do some of the biggest players maintain capital controls (including creditors on outflows), many other measures, such as expansionary monetary policy, may have a material impact on the world interest rate. The second rationale for capital controls relates to **financial stability**. Foreign borrowing may amplify risks of a financial crisis, and such risks may not be taken into account in private borrowing-lending decisions (an [externality). Capital controls allow the authorities to price in the social risk inherent in private foreign borrowing, so that the externality can be \"internalized\" in private decisions. But[ controls can also create problems for other countries by deflecting capital flows elsewhere (by how much is a matter of some debate; but logically the deflection must occur, all that is in question is the amount). Some countries might welcome the additional flows, so for them, this is a bonus. But others may be in the same boat as the country that chooses to restrict inflows, that is, they may be worried about financial-stability risks at home, and the additional inflows they now face will only compound that worry. Does this mean that multilateral considerations should proscribe action by the first country? Not necessarily. If country A's interest is served by restricting inflows, and a (similar) country B faces more inflows as a result, the right answer is for each country, acting in a decentralized fashion, to impose controls appropriate to its own concerns. This would be unilaterally optimal and multilaterally efficient. So when would a multilateral solution be necessary? As argued in a paper by [Ostry, Ghosh, and Korinek, the crux is whether the capital controls themselves carry a welfare cost. You can think of the cost in many ways (bureaucracy, compliance), but perhaps the most salient cost is the one due to 'imperfect targeting'\u009d'the likelihood that when countries seek to keep 'hot money'\u009d out, they unwittingly also keep out 'good flows'\u009d (such as foreign direct investment for start- up projects). Once controls have an identified cost, coordination'which simply means each country taking into account the impact on other countries when choosing its own intervention'will generally be necessary to achieve global efficiency. When an inflow surge affects multiple recipient countries at once, there will be a tendency for each country to impose inflow controls that are too high under laissez-faire and coordination across recipient countries would seek to de-escalate an inflow control war (as countries on their own fail to take account of 'mutual deflection'\u009d of flows and the escalating response of others). The efficient outcome is not one where countries do not impose any controls'just lower controls than they would have chosen unilaterally. Coordination becomes thornier when the costs associated with controls are not only rising but, plausibly, rising at an increasing rate (a 10 percent tax is more than twice as distortionary as a 5 percent tax). This is because a solution now needs to involve the lender exercising some restraint on outflows, and the lender's interests to do so are not obvious. This brings us to the** third and last rationale for capital controls**'an externality in the production of exportables'sometimes referred to as a learning-by-doing externality (the more you produce, the more productive you become). Here the correct response from a national standpoint is a subsidy to producers'a solution that has nothing whatever to do with capital controls. But suppose for some reason this first-best response is not feasible (for example because there is no budget to finance the subsidy and some alternative policies, like a tax on producers of nontraded goods or an import tariff, are also not feasible'for example because the nontraded goods sector is 'informal'\u009d and thus not easily taxed, and international obligations rule out an import tariff). Then a policy of currency undervaluation, supported by capital controls (which limit inflows that would otherwise undo the undervaluation), may look an attractive option for the country. What does this look like from a multilateral perspective? Theoretically, it's no different from the financial-stability case considered earlier and so by this logic the country should be allowed to go ahead with controls and any spillovers to other countries should be viewed as an inherent part of how the market system functions. But **here the case is far less clear cut**. A high bar is necessary to ensure that countries do not disguise old-fashioned mercantilism as building up infant industries or 'learning-by-doing'\u009d. Moreover, currency undervaluation inherently has larger multilateral implications'in terms of the trade balance or the current account'than the optimal response (a production subsidy), and may frustrate other countries' attempts to benefit from learning-by-doing in their own tradables sector. For these reasons, in most cases, policies of undervaluation supported by capital controls should raise **red flags.** As such, there would likely be scrutiny attached to situations in which countries adopt or sustain policies that are likely to have a substantial effect on capital inflows when their currencies are undervalued, and particularly when the intent of the controls is to support undervaluation. **Implications** Our analysis underscores that capital flows, which bring enormous benefits to borrowers and lenders alike, may nevertheless require some multilateral principles for their safe management. The notion that international cooperation can mitigate the severity of boom- bust cycles in capital flows is one that goes back to the IMF's[ founding fathers. Global financial integration has progressed a long way in six decades, but multilateral oversight of both source and recipient countries to assist in the management of capital flow volatility remains a worthy objective, and one likely to be essential to safeguard the stability of the international monetary system'a core purpose of the IMF and its members.

And the quality of those [institutions hinges on the quality of the people running them'their educational background and training, and the prevailing business culture and approach to policymaking. The work of [Douglass North and the school of thought known as the [_new institutional economics_ has taught us that differences in deep institutions'defined as the formal and informal rules of economic, political and social interactions'are responsible for sustained differences in economic performance. This is also the central thesis in [Acemoglu and [Robinson's fascinating new book, [_Why Nations Fail_. Inclusive (as opposed to extractive) [economic and political institutions are central in nations' efforts to avoid stagnation and ensure sustained prosperity. This is because sustained prosperity is a dynamic process of constant innovation and a never-ending cycle of Schumpeterian creative destruction, which can only be supported by open, inclusive institutions. Their thesis is certainly consistent with the contrasting experience of different countries in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe under communism and during the past two decades. The current [crisis in the eurozone also highlights the importance of coherent economic and political institutions at all levels of economic development. Weaknesses in national macroeconomic and statistical institutions in supposedly 'advanced'\u009d countries were at the root of the crisis, especially in Greece. And the lack of supportive fiscal and regulatory institutions at the European level'which require making additional steps in political integration'is behind the markets' continued anxiety surrounding the common European currency. The IMF takes institutions seriously. The lesson we drew from the experience of transition and the current crisis is that we neglect them at our peril. That's why the Fund recently created a new [Institute for Capacity Development. The idea is to take a holistic look at our capacity development work and to develop, over time, an IMF-wide strategy for capacity development. #### **** #### #### **Taking stock** As part of our efforts to rethink how we help our 188 member countries train skilled professionals and build institutions that can be held accountable for their delivery of public goods'including a stable currency, efficient tax collection, and trustworthy data, to name but a few'the IMF co-sponsored a [conference in Vienna with the Austrian government. The [conference marked the 20th anniversary of the [Joint Vienna Institute, a training center financed by the IMF and Austria and which also involves several other international institutions. The JVI has been at the heart of the IMF's capacity building efforts since it was created in 1992, three years after the fall of the Berlin wall. For the past two decades, close to 30,000 officials at all levels of seniority'from Belarus to Bulgaria, Mongolia to Montenegro, and the Ukraine to Uzbekistan ' have received some form of training in applied economics and finance at the JVI. Many JVI alumni were present at the conference, which convened more than 140 policymakers and academics to discuss lessons learned from the global economic crisis, the challenges ahead for the countries of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and the implications this might have for training and capacity development. #### **A new approach to people and institutions** What areas to prioritize in terms of future training clearly depend on many factors: countries' levels of economic development, their state of integration in the European Union or other regional structures, and other individual circumstances. This heterogeneity brings to the fore the need for more **tailored approaches to training and capacity development**, more coordination between [technical assistance and [training, and closer integration of training in national capacity development strategies. One way to make progress in this direction is to go beyond assessments of training and capacity development activities in terms of improvements in the skills of individuals being trained and examine the impact of training on the capacity of the units and organizations to perform their functions. This will require us to think creatively about ways to make training and technical assistance more demand-driven and to pay attention to how well units and organizations utilize the people who have been trained. We will also need to find more ways to exploit the synergies between technical assistance and training. Clearly, we also need to do much more to harness the potential of **e-learning** or we will be left behind. Many informed people think that we are on the cusp of a revolution in the delivery of education via the internet. Web-based tools would allow us to reach the many officials who are not able to come to Washington or the regional centers where training is delivered. It would also allow officials to prepare better for the courses they are able to attend. It may even allow us to explain the IMF's purposes and policies to a broader public, including civil society, than we can with our traditional approach to training. Also important for capacity development is the learning that takes place outside formal courses, in small, informal, high-level meetings that involve peer-to-peer interaction. We want to explore ways in which the JVI'and the IMF's other [training centers around the world'can be part of this network. We want to go beyond the standard two-week courses and consider flexible, customized seminars on special topics of interest to senior policymakers. We also intend to enhance our outreach efforts to civil society, journalists, parliamentarians, [students, and the public at large. We also need to do more to incorporate non-traditional thinking in our training. The crisis is forcing a [reconsideration of economic doctrine and policies. Old lessons are being rediscovered. Textbooks on macroeconomic stabilization, growth models, and modes of financial system supervision and regulation are being rewritten. We already invite experts to present alternative views in our training courses. But we need to do this in a more systematic fashion so as to reflect emerging, non-conventional thinking in our training programs. #### **Making a difference** In short, we have a lot of work to do. Apart from the excellent discussion and the many ideas that were offered by our speakers as well as the audience in Vienna, what really struck me personally was the great enthusiasm that many JVI alumni expressed for the training they had received after the fall of communism and during the hard years of transition that followed. Governor Gerg\u00c3?ri expressed these feelings most eloquently: '_It was my first time going outside the country. I remember it still, very much. It was exactly ten years ago here in Vienna, in this very melodious city. I came here, had the three-week course in monetary and financial statistics. I was flooded with enthusiasm because I was opening a small window for big opportunities'for my institution, and then this is the way I started in fact to build also my career_.'\u009d Building people, building institutions: that's what we at the IMF hope we can continue to achieve'and become even better at in the future'working in partnership both with countries that receive technical assistance and training and with the many donors around the world whose financial support enables us to provide these services.

The combined effect of these measures could result in a huge fiscal contraction, which would derail the economic recovery. **Why is this happening?** The payroll tax break, the Bush tax cuts (enacted in 2001 and 2003, and extended for two years at the end of 2010), as well as exemptions on the Alternative Minimum Tax are set to expire on January 1, 2013. As for the cuts to government spending, it was agreed last summer that if the so-called 'Super Committee'\u009d (a Congressional committee in charge of reducing the deficit) failed to approve a set of deficit-reduction measures, draconian cuts to defense and nondefense spending would take effect starting on January 1, 2013. Unfortunately, this threat did not work as envisaged'the Super Committee did not come up with any plan to reduce the deficit'and, as a result, the deep spending cuts are scheduled to kick in. All in all, the cliff would remove about $700 billion from the U.S. economy next year'over 4 percent of GDP'with higher taxes contributing about three quarters of the total. **Is it really that bad?** Unfortunately, yes. The reason is that the [U.S. economy is still slowly mending from the effects of the[ financial crisis. The pace of the recovery is tepid, and unemployment remains elevated. The fiscal cliff would reduce growth to about zero on an annual basis in 2013, and the economy would most likely fall into a recession early next year. This is because the large tax increases would make consumers and businesses cut back on their expenditures, while the steep government spending cuts would also subtract from growth. Furthermore, one traditional response'monetary policy action to lower interest rates'is hampered in the current environment because rates are already extraordinary low. And a weakening world economy would not be able to provide much support by buying U.S. goods and services. What's more, the negative impact of the cliff could start materializing even sooner, as uncertainty about what is going to happen early in 2013 might lead consumers, businesses, and government agencies to hold back their spending already this year, in anticipation of the cuts. Yes, the U.S. needs to raise taxes and cut spending. But it should do so gradually, without sapping the economic recovery. **What can be done about it? ** In principle, the fix is easy. A political agreement should be reached to ensure that tax increases and/or spending cuts are carried out by only a modest amount next year. Such an [agreement would be all the more powerful in restoring confidence if it also included a credible plan to gradually raise taxes further and limit the growth of spending, so that the U.S. public debt stops growing faster than U.S. GDP. In practice, of course, things are never easy, and there are significant differences across the U.S. political spectrum on how to reduce the deficit. But there is some common ground, and a number of bipartisan plans have been put forward. **The second self-inflicted wound** In late 2012 or early 2013 the U.S. federal government will again reach a statutory borrowing limit and will not be able to issue additional debt. Why is this a problem? First, because the federal government is spending considerably more than it collects in taxes; and second, because spending and tax collections are not synchronized. As a result, if the ceiling is not raised in time, the government would need to cut spending drastically, curtailing important government functions, with detrimental effects on output and employment. And just the mere possibility that the government might have to delay a payment on a bond could unsettle financial markets. In the past, Congress has raised this limit on a regular basis. But last summer an acrimonious debate delayed the lifting of the debt ceiling until the very last minute. True, interest rates on Treasury bonds did not rise, as many had anticipated, but financial markets suffered, and uncertainty and a decline in faith in the political system took a toll on consumer and business confidence. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time to regain confidence and trust, but it takes one rash action to lose it. Wounds are painful and can take a long time to heal'but self-inflicted ones are easy to avoid.

The Arab Spring has injected new optimism into the Middle East and North Africa and, if managed well, the historic transitions that are under way will lead to a more prosperous future for the people of the region. At the same time, the past year and a half has been difficult for the Arab countries in transition. They are [facing economic strains as they manage political change and urgent social demands. It is a period when hard choices must be made, and it does not help that this is happening at a time of great turmoil in the global economy. **Close engagement** Throughout this difficult period, the IMF has remained closely engaged. We are advising countries on how to manage shocks to maintain economic stability, ensure that vulnerable households are protected during the transition, and lay the basis for job-creating growth. We are also providing technical assistance to help build capacity and stronger institutions. In [Egypt, for example, on tax reform to improve tax equity; in [Libya to better manage its wealth through improved public financial management; and in [Tunisia on measures to strengthen the financial sector. Another priority'at a time when government budgets are stretched'is to help countries meet their financing needs. As we said in early 2011, the IMF stands ready to provide such financial assistance, but it must come when the countries themselves feel the timing is right and in support of economic programs that are designed by, and enjoy broad support in the country. As part of this process, I am pleased to say that a few days ago, in response to the authorities' request, the IMF Board approved two loans in support of the economic reform agendas of Arab countries in transition: one for Jordan under a Standby Arrangement in the amount of $2.05 billion, and another for Morocco in the amount of $6.2 billion under our Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). This follows on our earlier concessional loan to Yemen under the Rapid Credit Facility. **One size does not fit all** The IMF's assistance varies across the region, given that each country faces its own economic challenges, and the instruments to tackle those challenges must be tailored to address those unique circumstances. In [Jordan, the IMF loan supports the authorities' program to stabilize the economy and address the negative impact of exogenous shocks, mainly in its energy sector, as well as regional unrest. It will allow Jordan to guard against additional shocks and avoid sharp adjustments that could have an adverse impact on growth and the vulnerable segments of the population. By providing liquidity over the next three years, it will also allow the authorities to implement their national reform program gradually and with adequate measures to protect the poor and vulnerable households. And, it will support the authorities' efforts to foster high and inclusive through measures to improve the business environment, enhance transparency, and foster trade. In [Morocco, our financial assistance is designed to provide insurance in case the country is affected by a sharp deterioration in its external economic environment. Morocco's track record of sound economic policies has contributed to solid economic performance, which, in turn, has helped cushion the impact of the global crisis and respond to pressing social needs. So, Morocco does not have an immediate need for any IMF financing; nevertheless, uncertainties about the euro zone and possible higher oil prices pose real risks. The two-year PLL with the IMF provides Morocco with a useful insurance policy for meeting any possible financing needs should these risks materialize. For [Yemen, approval of the concessional IMF loan earlier in the year allowed for the immediate disbursement of financial assistance to support the country's economic recovery program following a prolonged political crisis. **Learning from experience** In providing support, we have taken something of a new approach that draws upon the lessons of the[ Arab Spring and the IMF's experience in its 188 member countries. We know that programs are much more likely to succeed if they are designed and owned by the national authorities and enjoy broad support within the country. We are also focusing much more explicitly on policies that ensure that the benefits of [economic growth are shared more broadly and on protecting the most vulnerable members of society. The Arab Spring has shown vividly that aggregate growth numbers alone tell only part of story. For growth to be sustainable, it must create jobs, its benefits should be widely spread'not captured by a few'and there should be a broader and fairer distribution of economic opportunities across the population. We are bringing this new understanding into our engagement with the region, and our discussions with authorities reflect this. I encourage you to look up the documents that will soon be on our website describing the programs we are supporting in Jordan and Morocco and tell us what you think.

As I step down from my position as Director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere Department, I would like to share some reflections on one of the central issues facing many countries'adjustment under fixed exchange rates. It goes without saying that these reflect a personal and not an institutional view. A lot of ink has been spent over the question of why you would lend money to a country trying to bring down its government debt and deficit. The answer is simple: to give the reforms needed to make economies competitive again time to kick in. In the old days, fixed exchange rates were the norm rather than the exception. A body of literature and a wealth of country experience have accumulated on how to adjust under such exchange rate regimes, mostly in emerging economies. The expression 'adjustment and financing'\u009d came to summarize what economies should do when faced with severe funding constraints brought on by high borrowing costs for government debt in financial markets. ** ** #### **Financing constraints, spending adjustment, and regaining competitiveness** Financing stress prevents an economy from maintaining its spending plans. With creditors unwilling to extend financing, reductions in government spending become unavoidable. Spending above the level of production, the root cause of debt accumulation and financing stress, needs to be reversed for financing to start flowing again. But what is produced must be sold'without demand to make up for spending cuts, production will fall too. If adjustment is to work, then producers of goods need to find new buyers to replace financing-constrained ones. Where can those new buyers come from? If, as is the case in a number of European economies nowadays, the excess debt and ensuing financing constraints affect both the public and private sector, then new buyers need to be found abroad through exports. However, exports will not appear just because goods produced at home find fewer domestic buyers; goods need to have a combination of quality and price that is attractive to foreigners. When domestic debt was increasing, home goods became less attractive: excess spending harms the trade balance, and inflates the prices of non-tradable goods and services'including wages. In turn, higher wages make exports less competitive. When governments have a hard time financing themselves, the economy is no longer competitive enough to automatically capture foreign demand. Part of the problem arises from the high costs of non-traded inputs. But, sometimes the competitiveness problem is more deeply entrenched, as booms in nontradables'typically housing'may have masked the underlying lack of competitiveness in exports, fostering complacency about the reforms needed to revive productivity. #### **Vicious circle** Adjustment'the process of reducing government debt and deficits while restoring competitiveness'typically entails austerity and structural reforms. Austerity is needed to fit spending to the amount of available financing and bring down non-tradable prices to restore competitiveness, since currency devaluation is not an option. A coordinated reduction of non-tradable prices including wages, agreed between labor unions and businesses, would be best, as it would mitigate the shrinkage in spending needed to realign non-tradable prices. But such agreements are often difficult to achieve. Structural reforms typically include measures to facilitate the downward adjustment of non-traded goods prices. Reforms in labor and product markets achieve this by increasing flexibility and competition. But, if competitiveness is very weak, other reforms may be needed to spur comparative advantages in new sectors. By their very nature, structural reforms take time to kick in and boost exports. In the meantime, if austerity is the only response to financial stress, the economy will experience a severe downturn or worse. As domestic spending shrinks, with the pull from exports still to occur, output will contract. Government revenue will also contract, feeding creditors' fears of default and crimping financing. In the private sector, contracting output will push down asset values, and affecting firms' ability to borrow. Banks, typically overexposed to the non- tradable sector, will face sizable loan losses. If they respond, as is likely, through defensive deleveraging, this will exacerbate the contraction of private demand. In turn, deflationary pressures will increase the real value of debts, further adding to the malaise. Eventually, the downturn would end as falling non-tradable prices make exports profitable again and boost import-competing home goods. But the output loss would be needlessly large. As structural reforms mature, the economy will once again become competitive, with the ensuing surge in exports boosting domestic demand and partially reviving the non-tradable sector. The trade surplus will allow the country to reduce foreign debt, and the recovery in tax collection will repair the balance sheet of the government, restoring access to market financing. #### **How to avoid excessive output loss** Why will the output loss be needlessly large? With prices slow to adjust until structural reforms kick in, the exchange rate inflexible, and financing tight, the up-front burden falls on output and employment. This excess output loss can be so severe that it strains the social fabric, a deep loss in itself, and introduce the perception of political and default risks. Official financing'for instance in the form of an IMF-supported program'during the economic transition while structural reforms mature will help avoid this fate, supported by steps to reduce non-tradable prices. To be certain, conditionality will be needed to prevent structural reforms from stalling. These reforms are usually difficult and require governments to spend a significant amount of political capital. Hence, the risk of backsliding will be present for some time. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund are now trying to provide financing to many besieged economies in Europe and avoid excessive output losses. Adjustment without financing may fail and, even if it succeeds, it will impose needless sacrifice, often the more vulnerable segments of the population. But also, no one should believe in the mirage that the problem could be solved without adjustment and sacrifice. As markets sometimes indulge countries by financing unsustainable expansions, all too often when they respond they overshoot and over-penalize. By then, the reality of austerity has arrived to stay. ", "index": 485}, {"pub": "8/1/2012", "title": "Japan Stands Up", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5371", "content": " [By [Jerry Schiff (Version in [\u00e6?\u00a5\u00e6?\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa?) As a Japanese proverb has it: 'Knocked down seven times, get up eight.'\u009d In a display of its resilience, **Japan** is getting up once again after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of a year ago. But the world's third largest economy still faces multiple challenges, and in our latest [assessment of the country's economy, the Japanese mission team at the International Monetary Fund has proposed a range of mutually reinforcing policies to strengthen confidence, raise growth and help restore [Japan's economic vitality. A year and four months ago, Japan was reeling from the Great East Japan earthquake and accompanying devastation. As well as the tragic loss of life, the economy was badly shaken. Supply chain disruptions brought production in parts of Japan to a virtual halt. Yet, since then, the country has shown its resilience, with reconstruction contributing to strong first quarter growth of 4\u00c2\u00be percent. But despite this hopeful sign, **all is not well**. A contentious debate over how to address the large and growing public debt has occupied the political center stage. Deflation continues to affect economic activity, euro Area turmoil is casting clouds on growth prospects, and the appearance of an army of office workers in 'cool biz'\u009d attire is a reminder of continuing energy shortages. Against this backdrop, the IMF conducted its regular [health check of the world's third largest economy. Following that annual checkup, and in response, Fund staff are proposing a virtuous circle of positive, integrated policies: well-designed fiscal adjustment plans to strengthen confidence, and structural reforms to raise growth and support central bank actions to end deflation. Indeed, an end to deflation would help fill fiscal coffers and support activity, and so on. #### **Rising debt** The first order of business is to put Japan's fiscal house in order. Net debt has increased ten-fold since 1990 and'at 130 percent of GDP'is the highest of any advanced economy. Over the same period, social security spending has risen from 10 to 22 percent of GDP while associated revenues have remained flat. These developments threaten fiscal sustainability, but also place an enormous burden on the young. A [typical household with head aged between 20 and 29 can expect to make net resource transfers to the government of 16 years of their income over a lifetime. So, how should Japan address this rising debt burden? The crisis in Europe offers two critical lessons. #### **Lessons from Europe** Once investor confidence is lost, regaining it is no simple task. So, while bond yields are low and there is no imminent threat of a crisis, it is critical for Japan to put in place as soon as possible, a credible medium-term adjustment plan. The recent passage by the lower house of parliament of a doubling of the consumption tax to 10 percent by 2015 is an important step. More will be needed, but this is a strong statement of purpose. Secondly, adjustment is necessary, but adjustment without growth is unlikely to work. Japan's potential growth has been depressed by a shrinking labor force and weak investment. Furthermore, adjustment may weigh on near-term growth. Failure to raise potential growth will make it all the more difficult to reduce the debt burden on the economy. #### **A more dynamic Japan** So how to raise growth? Some potentially fruitful directions to consider: * **Fiscal adjustment** can be designed to encourage growth, by enhancing incentives to work and invest. For example, a higher consumption tax rate could be combined with a rise in the retirement age'in line with increased longevity'corporate and payroll tax cuts and the elimination of distorting tax deductions. * **Increasing women in work**: Japan's declining population places a premium on raising women's labor force participation'currently among the lowest in advanced economies. It won't be easy, but there are policy levers, including tax reform and deregulation of day and long-term care. * **Increasing integration:** Japan lives in a good neighborhood, close to rapidly growing Asian markets. It lags in both inward and outward FDI, but is increasingly integrated into the region'new auto facilities in Indonesia and expanded financial activity throughout Asia are [examples. Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other free trade agreements would strengthen this momentum. And this would be good for the region as a whole: a staff paper finds positive spillovers to Asia from Japanese FDI (_forthcoming 2012 IMF Spillover Report)._ * **Financing Growth**: The Japanese [financial system, while sound, could do more to support growth. Venture capital and other financing for start-ups lag badly, while less dynamic SMEs receive guaranteed loans. A reorientation of public policy is needed. All this is easier said than done, of course, but Japan's history emphasizes its ability to reinvent and revitalize itself. It can do so again. _ _ ", "index": 486}, {"pub": "7/27/2012", "title": "Convergence, Crisis, and Capacity Building in Emerging Europe", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5343", "content": " [ by [Nemat Shafik Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe has been through a lot. In two short decades, the region moved from a communist planned system to a market economy, and living standards have converged towards those in the West. It has also weathered major crises: first the break-up of the old Soviet system in the early 1990s, then the Russian financial crisis in 1998, and finally the recent global economic crisis. How did these countries do it? From the Baltic to the Balkans, the [ region's resilience and flexibility are the result of hard work and adaptability. But more than anything, it is the strong institutions built over the last two decades that have enhanced the region's ability to deal with the momentous challenges of the past, the present'and those to come. **Building blocks for stable economies ** The IMF's role in the region's transition is most often associated with the emergency financing and sometimes tough advice that we dispensed during this period. The focus in the early 1990s was on getting the big picture right: stable economies, price and trade liberalization, and privatization. [ But, little noticed from outside, our involvement went deeper. Behind the scenes the long and arduous job of building skills and capacity was underway. In fact, many of the countries emerging from communism regarded the IMF's [technical assistance and training as even more valuable than its lending and broader policy advice. Capacity building, of course, isn't just about setting up new agencies or dispatching foreign advisors. It is doomed to fail without qualified staff to use the new legal and regulatory tools, to formulate policies and to execute them. There was no lack of smart and educated people in emerging Europe'what they needed were new skills and perspectives. I firmly believe that the region's remarkable transition during the past 20 years would not have been possible without these well-trained civil servants, many of them alumni of the [Joint Vienna Institute, a training center sponsored by the IMF, Austria, and other international institutions. **Lessons from the crisis** This investment in human capital paid off handsomely when the global economic crisis hit in 2008. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and what followed profoundly shook the region: growth, trade and employment collapsed and default threatened some governments and financial institutions. The region avoided the much feared meltdown thanks to quick and well-executed policies supported by unprecedented international financial support. Today, the ongoing [crisis in the eurozone is the main threat to recovery because of the region's close financial and economic ties to Western Europe. This is particularly true for countries where vulnerabilities remain high'those with substantial financing needs, widespread foreign-currency lending, and banks saddled with high [non-performing loans. No wonder that these were the economies most affected by spillovers when the eurozone crisis intensified in the second half of 2011. As Eastern Europe struggles to come to grips with the uncertain outlook, it's worth remembering lessons learned from the recent boom-bust experience. **First**, every boom'no matter how unsustainable'has a good story at the time. Many of us were misled by the perception that the imbalances, including huge current account deficits and double-digit credit growth, were a benign byproduct of inevitable convergence toward European living standards. With the benefit of hindsight we now know that the laws of economic gravity hold'in emerging Europe just as now in the eurozone. **Second,** counter-cyclical policies may be insufficient to fully prevent a bust, but they can dampen it. Take Estonia's conservative pre-crisis fiscal policy, which kept its budget under control and allowed the country to join the euro in 2011. Or the National Bank of Poland's far-sighted prudential policies that discouraged foreign exchange denominated borrowing, which made it less vulnerable to currency volatility. **Third,** a decisive and well-designed policy response can help overcome the crisis quickly. There is no silver bullet. What matters is that a country's program is internally consistent and properly executed. We at the IMF have stood by Latvia's ambitious consolidation based on maintaining its currency peg, just as we have supported the more conventional adjustments in Hungary, Romania or Ukraine. Poland managed to avert a recession altogether, thanks to a flexible exchange rate and apt policy response, supported by a financial backstop from the IMF. **Fourth,** in meeting these challenges two decades of capacity building bore fruit. In fact, this is the common theme that runs through this brief history of transition, crisis, and crisis resolution. Underpinning future growth with strong institutions'skilled policymakers and their staff'is key to sustaining the success. **Finally**, well-coordinated international support and close cooperation between the public and private sectors make a difference. As case in point are the joint IMF-EU financial support programs in the region, and the 'Vienna Initiative'\u009d'a unique body that brought together governments, regionally active banks and international institutionsto maintain lending levels to the private sector in the region. **The look ahead** What will the future hold for Eastern Europe? Much will depend on how the crisis in the eurozone is resolved. In the meantime, the answer at the country level is to address vulnerabilities head- on: by improving competitiveness, reducing fiscal financing needs or dealing with non-performing loans. Given its institutional capacities, I am confident that the region will yet again be able to design and implement the policies necessary to meet these challenges. At the international level, we need to reactivate the successful international cooperation of the recent past. This includes the revival of the [Vienna Initiative, taking into account the [ new circumstances for parent banks. It may also include financial support, possibly precautionary, from the international community. The IMF has stood by this region since the end of communism. We will continue to help whenever asked, with financing, policy advice, and capacity building.

A recent[ study by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department argues that reforms of tax and expenditure policies offer great promise in helping countries confront the jobs crisis, including in the short term. The study argues that improving employment outcomes, over and above what could be achieved through policies aimed at supporting the demand for goods and services by consumers and investors, requires actively supporting labor demand, strengthening incentives (or reducing disincentives) to work, and expanding training and job assistance, while preserving equity objectives. **The labor market challenge** The economic and social consequences of job losses since the onset of the global crisis have been enormous. However, as bad as the crisis has been for jobs, unemployment was already elevated before the crisis in many advanced and emerging economies. This would suggest that labor market challenges will not go away as the global economy recovers, and that policy measures are needed both to address structural employment issues and to improve the employment outlook in the short term. Three labor market challenges are particularly important: high rates of long- term unemployment'that is, unemployment lasting more than one year'which is often much higher than short-term unemployment, particularly when compared to Northern European countries that have effectively managed to contain long-term unemployment (Chart 1); high rates of youth unemployment'that is, unemployment among those aged 15'24'which stand at over 50 percent in Greece and Spain and close to three times the overall unemployment rate in a number of economies (Chart 2); and high unemployment rates for unskilled labor, which are much higher than those for skilled labor. [ [ In addition to having a large number of people without a job but searching for one, many countries also have a large share of the working-age population that is no longer looking for employment and thus not participating in the labor market. Non-participation may reflect cultural preferences or being discouraged from seeking work by weak job prospects or a lack of financial incentives. Raising labor force participation over the medium term can help spur economic growth and contribute to fiscal consolidation by expanding the tax base. **Policy design matters** Fiscal policy matters for employment'both in the short term and the medium term. There are several options to improve the design of taxes and benefits that can help boost employment without hurting equity. We see four areas of potential reform: * **Tax wedges**. Cutting the 'tax wedge,'\u009d that is, the amount of tax as a proportion of take-home pay, works best when targeted to groups that are most responsive to financial incentives: women, workers close to retirement, and the low-skilled. For example, low-skilled workers could be encouraged to work by receiving tax credits that increase their take-home pay. Reducing the tax wedge falling on the income of the secondary earner in a two-income family could encourage both spouses to work. In the short run, lower employer social insurance contributions, targeted to low-wage earners, can be effective in stimulating job creation. More progressive tax schedules (that is, tax schedules where the tax burden rises in percent of income as incomes go up), could also be considered as a revenue-neutral reform that reduces tax wedges for low-skilled workers. * **Unemployment benefits**. Tougher job search requirements for recipients of unemployment benefits, combined with intensive monitoring and appropriate sanctions, have been successful in reducing the length of unemployment spells. In particular, where the receipt of benefits has been made conditional on participation in 'active labor market'\u009d programs (see below), exit rates out of unemployment have increased considerably. * **Active labor market programs**. These programs can reduce unemployment by better matching those seeking work with job vacancies. They are most effective if targeted at the young and long-term unemployed. For example, subsidized on-the-job training and apprenticeships have been successful in smoothing the transition of youth from school to work. Targeted wage subsidies have been effective in generating jobs for the long-term unemployed and unskilled. A key lesson, however, is that, beyond targeted and time-limited interventions, merely providing more public sector jobs is generally ineffective in improving employment outcomes. * **Pension systems**. Older workers could be encouraged to work longer if their future pension benefits were adjusted fully for extra years of contribution, eliminating the financial incentive to retire early. Some may argue that the policies we recommend to increase labor force participation would be harmful, rather than helpful'don't the high levels of unemployment we see now mean that there are already too few jobs? The answer is timing'first of all, measures to foster higher labor-force participation will take more time to yield fruit than measures aimed at boosting demand or at improving matching. Further, over the longer-term, higher labor force participation rates, including for older workers, have been shown not to increase unemployment, but rather to be correlated with higher total employment through economic growth. **No time for delay** The appropriate reform mix differs across countries. It will need to be adapted to, and appropriately sequenced for, each country's employment challenges, labor market institutions, and fiscal constraints. An immediate priority for countries where unemployment has risen sharply is to restore labor demand and to implement active labor market programs that help match labor supply and demand. Beginning reforms to increase labor force participation, likewise, should not be delayed, given their longer gestation period. Now is the right time to implement structural reforms to tackle the employment crisis and to stimulate the demand for labor'and the design of policies matters very much for labor market outcomes. ", "index": 488}, {"pub": "7/19/2012", "title": "Mind The Gap: Policies To Jump Start Growth in the U.K.", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5317", "content": " [ By [Ajai Chopra The U.K. economy has been flat for nearly two years. This stagnation has left output per capita a staggering 14 percent below its precrisis trend and 6 percent below its pre-crisis level. Weak growth has kept unemployment high at 8.1 percent, with youth unemployment an alarming 22 percent. **The effects of a persistently weak economy and high long-term unemployment can reverberate through a country's economy long into the future'commonly referred to by economists as hysteresis.** Our [analysis of such hysteresis effects shows that **the large and sustained output gap, the difference between what an economy could produce and what it is producing, raises the danger that a downturn reduces the economy's productive capacity and permanently depresses potential GDP. ** Such effects could arise because of the erosion of skills from persistently high long-term unemployment, the scrapping of idle capital, and inadequate investment that erodes the capital stock and hinders innovation and the development of new technologies. This would be an enormous waste. But policymakers are not powerless; their action can help avoid such bleak outcomes. Notably, policies to bolster demand will help close the output gap faster, reduce the risk of hysteresis, and insure against the predominance of downside risks. So how should demand be stimulated? **Three policy priorities** **First,** monetary stimulus can be provided with further quantitative easing, which evidence suggests can continue to support demand by lowering long-term interest rates and improving banks' liquidity. In line with recommendations made in our report, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted on July 5, 2012 to expand further its quantitative easing program. The committee should also keep under review the merits of cutting the policy rate. The recent sharp flattening of the yield curve may have increased the stimulative effect of this instrument, possibly outweighing potential negative effects on money markets and financial stability. **Second,** credit easing measures can boost demand. Credit conditions remain tight because elevated bank funding costs have limited the quantity and maturity of lending to the private sector, despite significant monetary easing. We welcome recently announced efforts to lower private-sector borrowing costs through broader provision of bank funding against collateral with haircuts, including the 'funding for lending'\u009d program. Depending on the effectiveness of these new programs, further credit easing measures may be needed, including purchases of private-sector assets on secondary markets. The government is also considering taking advantage of its record-low borrowing costs to provide government guarantees to fund large, privately operated infrastructure projects. It is important, however, that the choice of projects and the modalities of their operation'public versus private, and financing by issuing public debt versus guarantees'is based on using public funds as efficiently as possible. They should also not be affected by attempts to artificially limit government gross debt or near-term expenditure. **Third,** slowing the pace of fiscal tightening would be the main policy lever to support demand if growth does not pick up sufficiently even after monetary stimulus and strong credit easing measures have been given time to work. The government's reduction of deficits over the last two years has created the space for recalibrating fiscal policy, if needed. **Delaying fiscal consolidation could yield gains** Our [analysis, which extends recent influential work by [DeLong and Summers, suggests that delaying fiscal consolidation can generate permanent gains if fiscal tightening has a larger negative effect on output during a period of negative or weak growth. The absence of growth, even after additional monetary and credit easing measures, would indicate that the ability of monetary policy to mitigate partially the contractionary effects of fiscal tightening is even more constrained than currently assumed, implying higher and more asymmetric multipliers when the economy is weak. This may occur, for example, if heightened uncertainty, including concern about tail risks, deters the private sector from borrowing, even in response to significantly cheaper and more easily available credit. In a nutshell, the **priority for U.K. policymakers is to implement more expansionary economic policies**, important elements of which are now in train. Without such policies, they risk weak demand that leads to persistently slow growth and high unemployment, which in turn will affect decisions made by consumers and investors, and permanently damage the long-run capacity of the U.K. economy.

Fiscal adjustment is continuing in the advanced economies at a speed that is broadly appropriate, and roughly what we projected three months ago. **In emerging economies there's a pause in fiscal adjustment this year and next**, but this too is generally appropriate, given that many of these countries have low debt and deficits. **The improvement in fiscal conditions in many advanced economies is welcome**, but it's going to take more than lower deficits to get countries under market pressure out of the crosshairs. **Signs of Progress** There are clear signs of fiscal progress in advanced economies. The deficit will decline in about three quarters of advanced economies this year, and in almost 90 percent of them next year. Debt ratios are also starting to come down: we project one-third of advanced economies to have a declining debt ratio this year and half of them to do so next year. The progress in deficit-cutting in **Europe** means less fiscal tightening will be needed in the future, reducing the fiscal drag on growth: in 2011'12 the fiscal tightening in the euro area will amount to a cumulative 2\u00c2? percentage points of GDP, while in 2013'14 it is projected to be one third of this, which is good news for growth. On the other hand, in the **United States** there is a risk that fiscal consolidation will increase dramatically next year, with the economy going over the 'fiscal cliff'\u009d of expiring tax cuts and of automatic spending cuts. A much more contained deficit decline would be preferable, and should be introduced in the context of a medium-term fiscal adjustment plan. There has been some weakening in the projected fiscal accounts in **emerging economies**. Many countries are now expected to show higher than anticipated deficits this year and next. This weakening in fiscal deficits reflects the deceleration in economic activity in the context of relatively stronger fiscal positions. There are a few countries where a more ambitious fiscal adjustment strategy is called for, but in most cases emerging economies have more fiscal space and some of them are using it wisely to cushion their economies against the impact of developments elsewhere. **Spreads not fully aligned with fundamentals** In spite of the progress in adjusting their fiscal accounts, **bond spreads remain very high for some euro area countries**'higher than what could be explained by fundamentals like debt and deficits, growth, and inflation. Italy and Spain pay spreads that are some 200'250 basis points above their fundamental level.

Timely implementation and further progress on banking and fiscal unions must be a priority. **And third, time is running out**. Now is the moment for strong political leadership, because tough decisions will need to be made to restore confidence and ensure lasting financial stability in both advanced and emerging economies. It is time for action. **Now, why have financial stability risks increased?** **** **First,** government bond yields in Southern Europe have sharply increased, while funding conditions for many European banks have deteriorated. The beneficial effects of the European Central Bank's extraordinary long-term refinancing operations have decreased in recent months, amid renewed policy uncertainty and growing concerns about the health of banks. This has led to a substantial flight to safe assets. **Second,** financial fragmentation has exacerbated the adverse feedback loop between weak banks and governments, and threatens to undermine the currency union. Private capital outflows have continued to erode the foreign investor base for government debt in countries such as Italy and Spain. Governments have increased their reliance on domestic banks to finance their public debt. At the same time, these banks have increasingly turned to the European Central Bank to meet their liquidity needs as wholesale funding markets remain closed to them. **Third**, sovereign and bank funding pressures have spilled over to the corporate sector in the periphery of the euro area. These companies have seen rising wholesale funding costs and a drop in bank lending. They are also facing a large amount of maturing bonds in the near term, which will likely exacerbate their funding squeeze. **Finally,** growth prospects in other advanced economies and emerging markets are a bit weaker. This has left them somewhat more vulnerable to spillovers from the euro area. It also reduces their ability to address home-grown fiscal and financial vulnerabilities. Uncertainties about the fiscal outlook in the United States present a particular latent risk to global financial stability. **Policy priorities** Given these risks, increased efforts are needed now to prevent financial conditions from further deteriorating and adversely affecting growth. **In the euro area,** the measures agreed at the recent European leaders' summit are significant steps to address the immediate crisis. While their timely implementation is essential, further efforts are necessary to break'once and for all'the adverse feedback loop between weak banks and weak sovereigns. In particular, measures are needed to help the euro area to **stabilize, integrate, and grow**. **Stabilization** requires bold policy actions right now. Policymakers should: * Strengthen the balance sheets of viable banks, where needed, through recapitalizations and restructurings. In some cases, this may involve direct equity injections from Europe's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism. * Strengthen sovereign balance sheets by implementing well-timed fiscal consolidation strategies and by enacting sweeping structural reforms. * Maintain supportive monetary and liquidity policies. * Consideration should also be given to actions at the euro area level to stabilize funding conditions in sovereign debt markets, such as the reactivation of the European Central Bank's Securities Markets Program. **Further integration** requires progress toward a full-fledged banking union and deeper fiscal integration. The planned, unified supervisory framework is the first building block of a future banking union. More building blocks will be needed, including a pan-European deposit insurance guarantee scheme and bank resolution mechanism with common backstops. **The United States' economy **is also facing an important fiscal turning point. By early next year, the U.S. is expected to reach the current debt ceiling. Financial market consensus suggests that the ceiling will be raised in time to avert a default. But a significant adverse market reaction cannot be excluded, especially if there is political gridlock over raising the ceiling. Credible medium-term fiscal consolidation is needed to avoid further sovereign rating downgrades and to preserve an important global public good'the stability of the U.S Treasury market. **Emerging economies **are facing a twin challenge: dealing with the impact from advanced economies' troubles, while confronting increasing home-grown vulnerabilities. * **Slowing global growth and spillovers from the euro area crisis** have clearly had an impact on many emerging markets, as seen in the response of equity markets and capital flows. * **Home-grown vulnerabilities** include rapid bank asset and credit growth in recent years, which may eventually trigger a significant increase in non-performing loans. Moreover, slowing domestic growth could erode bank profitability and pose risks to financial stability in countries such as Brazil, China, and India. * **In view of these challenges,** emerging economies need to pay special attention to the health of their domestic financial systems. At the same time, they need to preserve and increase the room for policy maneuver to respond to potentially large domestic and external shocks. Bold political actions are needed to address the balance sheet problems of banks and sovereigns. Monetary policy has bought valuable time and provided essential liquidity to financial systems, but political leaders need to make progress now. Concerns over the solvency of banks and governments, for example, cannot be addressed through liquidity measures alone. Now is the time for bold and concrete actions in advanced economies to achieve sustained balance sheet repair and institutional reform. Tough decisions will need to be made to restore confidence and ensure lasting financial stability in both advanced and emerging economies.

", "index": 492}, {"pub": "6/28/2012", "title": "Can Policymakers Stem Rising Income Inequality?", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5250", "content": " By [David Coady and [Sanjeev Gupta The issue of [**rising income inequality** is now at the forefront of public debate. There is growing [concern as to the economic and social consequences of the steady, and often sharp, increase in the share of income captured by higher income groups. While much of the discussion focuses on the factors driving the rise in [inequality'including globalization, labor market reforms, and technological changes that favor higher-skilled workers'a more pressing issue is what can be done about it. In our recent [study we find that public spending and taxation policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, a [crucial impact on income inequality in both advanced and developing economies. In advanced economies, this is especially important given that the ongoing fiscal adjustment needs to be continued for many years to reduce public debt to sustainable levels. But it is equally important in developing economies where inequality is relatively high. #### **Income inequality in recent decades** Our **database on inequality trends** in 150 advanced and developing countries shows that disposable income inequality (that is, after taxes and transfers) has increased in most advanced and many developing economies over recent decades (Chart 1). Inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient (which ranges from 0, when everyone has exactly the same income, to 1 when a single individual receives all the income of a society). Even more striking is the large variation in average income inequality across regions. [ Another striking trend has been the sharp increase in the share of income captured by the highest income groups since the early 1980s. For example, in the [**United States**, the share of market (that is, before taxes and transfers) income captured by the richest 10 percent surged from around 30 percent in 1980 to 48 percent by 2008. Similar trends have occurred in other advanced and also some developing economies. Some experts have argued that such increases have been a major contributor to the recent financial crisis. So what role has fiscal policy played in determining these trends? #### **A look at advanced economies** _The good news_ is that **taxes and public transfers** have played a significant role in offsetting the increase in inequality. Over the past two decades, fiscal policy decreased inequality by about one- third in OECD countries, with two-thirds of this decrease achieved through transfers such as child benefit and public pensions. The redistributive impact is even higher when in-kind transfers such as education and health are included. _The worrying news_ is that the **distributive impact of fiscal policy has diminished** since the mid-1990s. Chart 2 shows how market- and disposable-income inequality for working-age households have changed since the mid-1980s, with the difference between these capturing the redistributive impact of fiscal policy in each time period. Whereas fiscal policy offset 73 percent of the 3 percentage point increase in market-income inequality up to the mid-1990s, it offset a much lower 53 percent of the increase up to the mid-2000s. Over the whole period, market- income inequality grew by twice as much as redistribution! [ _What's responsible for the decreasing impact of fiscal policy?_ __ We find that the reduction in the generosity of** social benefits** (particularly unemployment and social assistance benefits) and lower **income tax** rates, especially at higher income levels, have contributed most to the reduced impact of fiscal policy since 1990s. This development is worrisome given the need for substantial fiscal [consolidation in advanced economies in the coming years. Indeed, in some countries, income distribution has already worsened since 2007 (for example, Ireland and Spain). However, fiscal policy can be used to mitigate the adverse impacts of consolidation by allowing automatic stabilizers (such as unemployment benefits) to work, protecting the most progressive social benefits, removing opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, and increasing reliance on wealth and property taxes. #### **Role of fiscal policy in developing countries** _The increase in inequality in advanced countries pales into insignificance when compared to the gap in inequality between developing and advanced economies_. Much of this higher income inequality can be explained by lower levels of taxation and public spending (Chart 3), as well as their greater reliance on less progressive tax and spending instruments. [ _So what can be done to change this?_ On the tax side, the focus should be more on **broadening tax bases** rather than increasing tax rates, through reduced tax exemptions, closing loopholes and improving compliance. However, continued tight revenue constraints and the large demands on these resources to finance development objectives means that greater emphasis will need to be placed on improving the progressivity of public spending through, for example, eliminating general price subsidies and better targeting of poverty programs to the most vulnerable.

Getting prices to reflect environmental damage will help slow pollution by encouraging people and firms to change their behavior and shift away from activities and products that pollute the planet. Paying true prices is something we need to do if we want to keep economic development on an environmentally sustainable track. Behind the concept of sustainable development lies a bold vision of the future, or '[The Future We Want,'\u009d as Ban Ki-Moon puts it. It is about the vitality of our global economy, the harmony of our global society, the nurturing of our global inheritance. It is about laying the foundation so that every single person can flourish and reach their true potential. #### Eyes on Rio This week the world is looking to Rio de Janeiro as those of us gathered there for the [Rio+20, United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development affirm our commitment to sustainable development'the idea that we should strive for economic growth, environmental protection, and social progress at the same time. Because, standing in the way of the future we want are the environmental problems we continue to face. [Climate change could lead to potentially devastating consequences down the line, especially for the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations. Look at **Africa**. This is the continent that contributes least to climate change, and yet suffers most from it. It is among the regions most at risk from natural disasters. It is the region with the highest rainfall volatility'and the region that desperately needs the rain for agriculture, growth, and employment. But environmental problems are broader than climate change. In **India**, for example, pollution from coal generation plants has been estimated to cause 70,000 premature deaths a year. Across the world, many of our fisheries are still being overharvested. And the delicate [ecosystems in many of our forests and wetlands remain under threat. Not everyone agrees on the appropriate policy responses to deal with environmental challenges. And that is one of the reasons why so many of us have gathered in Rio'to keep the dialogue going, and to continue to make incremental progress toward the future we want. While the International Monetary Fund is not an environmental organization, we cannot ignore the extensive human suffering and the misallocation of resources that leads us down the wrong path. And where we can, we will offer help in [finding solutions'something Christine Lagarde [spoke about in more detail last week at the [Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. #### **What's in a price?** One area where the IMF can help to promote sustainable development is by '[getting the prices right.'\u009d Getting appropriate pricing means, for example, making sure that companies and individuals pay the true cost of polluting our planet. The best way to come up with the true costs is through fiscal instruments, such as environmental taxes or emissions trading systems where governments sell pollution rights, to reflect environmental damages in the prices we pay for energy, food, driving our cars, and so on. Getting the prices right should form the centerpiece of policies to promote green, or environmentally sustainable, development. Because, as discussed in a new [IMF guide for policymakers, fiscal instruments can help to solve two of today's most urgent challenges: First, they can play a key role in** raising badly needed revenues.** In the United States, for example, a carbon tax of about $25 per ton of CO2'which would add 22 cents to a gallon of gasoline'could bring in about 1 percent of GDP, or over $1 trillion over a decade. And, as discussed in an [IMF-World Bank report for the G-20 last year, charges on international aviation and maritime emissions could meet about a quarter of the commitment developed countries have made to mobilize $100 billion a year for climate finance by 2020. Second, appropriately targeted fiscal instruments are, by far, **the most effective way to exploit opportunities to reduce environmental harm** across all sectors of the economy. Environmental taxes also galvanize clean technology development and deployment by the private sector'such as investments in energy efficiency and renewables. Recent empirical work at the Fund has confirmed this. #### **Our road ahead** But at present we are only at base camp in getting the prices right. Over 90 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions remain unpriced, only a handful of cities have begun to experiment with policies charge for the use of gridlocked roads, and worldwide farmers are not charged for the marginal costs of (increasingly scarce) water resources. And in fact, many countries continue to subsidize, rather than tax, fossil fuels, even though these subsidies may do very little to help the poorest members of society who do not have cars or access to electricity. As we push for pricing reform however, we need to think carefully about how vulnerable groups might be helped, for instance by strengthening social safety nets, or tightly focusing subsidies on products used by poorer groups. We can and must do better. We can all be a [part of the solution'rich nations and poor nations; economists, environmentalists, and social policymakers; public sector, private sector, civil society, and international organizations. We must all come together and work together. For in the end, we all share the same goal'to make this small planet we call our home a better place for this generation and for generations to come.

Tovar (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) **Latin America **has a long history of accidents that have occurred while navigating turbulent financial international waters. With risks looming over the world economy, should the region worry about new global financial waves? Global financial markets have seen frequent **bouts of severe stress** since 2008, although this isn't really anything new for the region. Global financial shocks have occurred on average every 2\u00c2? years since 1990, with significant effects on Latin America. [ But how costly are these shocks in terms of domestic output, and is [Latin America better placed to cope with them this time? In Chapter 3 of the IMF's latest [_Regional Economic Outlook:_ _Western Hemisphere_, we analyze whether changes in underlying fundamentals have made the region more or less vulnerable over time. The analysis, which complements our work on the [effects of terms-of-trade shocks, looks at what country features and policies make a difference. We focus here solely on the impact of the financial shocks by isolating the effect from commodity prices and global demand shocks. **Opposing forces** The impact of external financial shocks on domestic output in emerging economies generally depends on two factors: the extent of _financial linkages_ (integration) with the rest of the world, and the strength of the country's _economic fundamentals_. A higher degree of financial integration arguably increases a country's sensitivity to external financial shocks. Stronger fundamentals, on the other hand, tend to mitigate the impact of these shocks'both by helping maintain confidence on domestic macroeconomic management and so discouraging capital outflows, and by easing the economic adjustment following a given external shock. To assess the effects of global shocks, it is therefore necessary to examine where Latin America stands in these two areas. Over the past two decades, financial integration has deepened in Latin America. At the same time, key economic fundamentals have improved markedly, particularly those related to external and fiscal sustainability. Thus, given these opposing forces, it isn't immediately clear whether Latin America is [more or less vulnerable to financial shocks today than in the past. [ **Assessing what makes a difference** To shed light on this question, we studied the behavior of 40 emerging and 9 small advanced economies during seven episodes of global financial stress since 1990, and assessed the importance of different economic fundamentals in amplifying or mitigating the impact of these shocks. Our analysis yields some interesting insights: * **Exchange rate flexibility** is a key shock absorber, especially for financially integrated economies. * A country's **external position** (for example, its current account balance and external debt) also plays a part in determining how well a country does during times of external crisis. * Higher **financial integration** does not always increase a country's vulnerability to external financial shocks. The country's **exchange rate regime** is critical for this relationship: financial integration amplifies financial shocks in economies with fixed exchange rate regimes, but mitigates those shocks in economies with more flexible regimes. Overall, this means that financially integrated economies with strong fundamentals (especially exchange rate flexibility) are better equipped to cope with global financial shocks than countries with weak fundamentals and limited financial linkages. **Where does Latin America stand? ** Our research shows that the progress made by [Latin America on economic fundamentals appears to have paid off. [ Simulations show that despite increasing financial integration, output costs associated with global financial shocks in Latin America have declined in the past 15 years. Of course, the progress made so far does not make the region immune, but has helped it to ride more safely through the recent global financial waves. As we've [pointed out previously, the region should take precautions in case of a bigger global downturn. But so far it can take credit for its hard work on the policy front.

There is little doubt that the era of generous parent-funding for subsidiaries is over. But parent bank deleveraging'selling off assets, raising capital, and reducing loans, including to their subsidiaries'need not translate into a reduction of bank credit in emerging Europe. A credit crunch can be avoided as long as parent banks reduce exposures gradually and domestic deposits, other banks, and local financial markets fill the void. Policymakers should create the conditions for this to happen. #### **The ties that bind** The dependence of the banking systems in emerging Europe on Western European banks is well known: * **Ownership**' foreign banks control more than half of the banking systems in most of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Their share exceeds 80 percent in Bosnia, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Romania, and Slovakia. Only in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Slovenia, and Turkey do they not dominate. [ * **Funding**' foreign banks have lent up to 60 percent of GDP to countries in the region. The average stands at 27 percent of GDP. Roughly half of it is to banks, and direct cross-border lending to households and firms accounts for the rest. [ Reflecting these close financial ties, whatever happens to Western Europe's banks is keenly felt in emerging Europe. When western banks felt flush in the years leading up to the crisis, **they bankrolled much of the region's credit-driven domestic demand boom**. Not all countries with a large presence of foreign banks had a credit boom; the Czech Republic did not. When the global economic crisis hit in 2008, funding for the region came to an abrupt halt, and most countries fell into deep recessions. With western banks now under pressure from the euro area crisis, is emerging Europe once again on the brink? A closer look at developments in the second half of 2011 is instructive here. In this period, western banks were under intense funding pressures, before the European Central Bank provided relief by launching its 3-year refinancing operations. To cope, western banks reduced their funding to banks in the region by 8 percent. Yet, during the same period banks in Eastern Europe managed to attract substantial additional domestic deposits. The combined funding from both sources still grew in almost all countries, with the notable exceptions of Slovenia and Hungary. #### **Plan for a rainy day and diversify** Countries need to do two things to mitigate the impact of possible future funding losses from western banks. The **first priority** for policymakers is to promote stable domestic financial systems so that depositors continue to entrust their savings to banks that intermediate them effectively. Countries should maintain high standards for liquidity and capitalization, as well as sort out [nonperforming loans, which are still high in much of the region. Developing additional funding sources, for example by promoting local currency financial markets, is also an important objective. Second, **countries need to be prepared for an escalation of financial tensions** at home or abroad. Frameworks for emergency support and bank resolution have been upgraded throughout the region'the main challenge now is to make sure that they would work smoothly in practice. Contingency planning, tight monitoring of banks, and close coordination between financial supervisors in the banks' home and host countries are all critical. #### **No sudden moves** Policymakers also need to ensure that deleveraging remains orderly. Sudden large-scale exposure reductions of foreign banks would be difficult to compensate'and would also pose challenges for the balance of payments. Home and host country bank supervisors should work together in case a cross-border bank needs support or must be resolved. They should keep each others' interest in mind and avoid sudden and unilateral actions with adverse consequences for the other. This kind of coordination is at the heart of the latest initiative by officials, bankers, and regulators known as [Vienna 2.0. Given the tremendous credit boom many countries in emerging Europe went through between 2003 and 2008, some gradual and orderly deleveraging of western parent banks would not be a bad thing'it would help reduce the still high external debt in many countries. But orderly and gradual are the key words. Europe's emerging economies stand a good chance of leading a healthy life with deleveraging by parent banks, if policymakers and banks work together to keep the system on an even keel. ", "index": 497}, {"pub": "6/11/2012", "title": "Lessons from Latvia", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5180", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard In 2008, **Latvia** was widely seen as an economic \"basket case,\" a textbook example of a **boom turned to bust**. From 2005 to 2007, average annual growth had exceeded 10%, the current account deficit had increased to more than 20% of GDP. By early 2008 however, the boom had come to an end, and, by the end of 2008, output was down by 10% from its peak, the fiscal deficit was shooting up, capital was leaving the country, and reserves were rapidly decreasing. The treatment seemed straightforward: a sharp nominal depreciation, together with a steady fiscal consolidation. The Latvian government however, wanted to keep its currency peg, partly because of a commitment to eventually enter the euro, partly because of the fear of immediate balance sheet effects of devaluation on domestic loans, 90% of them denominated in euros. And it believed that credibility required strong frontloading of the fiscal adjustment. **Painful adjustment** Many, including me, believed that keeping the peg was likely to be a recipe for disaster, for a long and painful adjustment at best, or more likely, the eventual abandonment of the peg when failure became obvious. Nevertheless, given the strong commitment of both Latvia and its European Union partners, the [IMF went ahead with a program which kept the peg and included a strongly front-loaded fiscal adjustment. Four years later, [Latvia has one of the highest growth rates in Europe, the peg has held, and the fiscal and current accounts are close to balance. The mechanics of adjustment have been straightforward'a further sharp decrease in output, followed by increases in competitiveness due initially to decreases in wages, but increasingly due to productivity gains. Growth has come initially from external demand, but is coming increasingly from domestic demand. Unless Europe has a meltdown, [growth should continue. **Big costs** **Is it a success? ** The economic and social cost of adjustment has been substantial. Output further contracted by 16% in 2009, and is still 15% below its 2007 peak. Unemployment increased to more than 20% and still stands at 16% today, far higher than any reasonable estimate of the natural rate. Was there another, less costly, way of adjusting, through floating, and a slower fiscal consolidation? The truth is we shall never know. What is true though is that the adjustment looks likely to succeed under the peg, something that many of us thought nearly impossible, that the economy is growing, and that there is optimism in the air'a feeling quite unusual in Europe these days. This surely satisfies some definition of success. **Why has it worked?** Preparing for the [conference I just attended in Riga in which we tried to draw lessons, and reading the evidence, I could think of seven reasons (at the conference, some, including the Prime Minister, had other lists. The reasons were more general; for example, ownership of the program by the Latvians, a clear exit strategy, namely the promise of entry into the euro. My list is more prosaic, closer to an analysis of the plumbing, of each of the parts of the adjustment mechanism). 1. The **adjustment was preceded by an unusually strong boom**, so there was wide acceptance on the part of people that part of the downward adjustment was a return to normal. Some of the tough measures were seen as undoing the excesses of the past, for example the very large increases in nominal wages during the boom. 2. There was **support for fiscal consolidation**, and the acceptance of pain. Parties which argue for stronger fiscal austerity often did better than the others at the polls. Pedagogy, a factor emphasized by the Prime Minister (in his book with Anders Aslund, which gives a detailed account of the crisis and of the adjustment) was surely important. But historical reasons, including the painful transition from central planning in the 1990s, surely played an important role. The Latvians could take the pain. 3. **Wages were flexible**, at least relative to the generic European labor market. The initial adjustment came with a dramatic reduction in public sector wages, and thus a direct improvement in the fiscal position. Together with unemployment, lower public sector wages put pressure on private sector wages to adjust. A note of caution is needed here however: private sector wages, which are the wages which matter for competitiveness, have adjusted much less than public sector wages (by how much is a matter of some [disagreement). Indeed, I worry that nominal wages have started to increase, while more adjustment still has to come to maintain current account balance as output recovers. One has to hope that increases in productivity will do the trick. This takes me to the next point. 4. There was'and, looking forward, there still is'substantial room for **productivity increases**. Latvia has income per capita of half the European Union average. Being far behind the technology frontier, it has a lot of room for catch up. 5. Latvia is a **small, open economy**--although less so than its Baltic neighbors. With exports around 50% of GDP, improvements in [competitiveness can have large effects on both imports and exports, and in turn on GDP. 6. **Public debt was very low** to start, less than 10% of GDP. Even today, public debt remains around 40% of GDP. This more or less eliminated foreign investors' worries about default on sovereign debt, and allowed for a quicker return of Latvia to international financial markets. 7. The Latvian financial system was largely composed of **relatively friendly foreign banks**'better than unfriendly foreign banks, or friendly but weak domestic banks.For the most part, the Swedish banks recapitalized their banks and maintained their credit lines to the Latvian subsidiaries, reducing the intensity of the sudden stop and of the credit squeeze. Latvian policymakers would surely want me to add yet another reason'the strong front loading of fiscal consolidation: over the first two years of the program, the cyclically adjusted primary balance was increased by 11% of GDP. I am not sure. Growth was negative and large in 2009. Whether a slower adjustment would have led to less of an overall output loss just cannot be assessed. But I still draw two conclusions from what [happened. While the decrease in output was dramatic, the recovery has been relatively more V shaped than I expected, although I still worry about the effects of long term unemployment. And the Latvian experience makes a strong political case for taking into account adjustment fatigue. While the large initial budget cuts went through relatively easily, taking much smaller steps proved much more difficult in the 2011 budget. The political argument for front loading thus strikes me as fairly strong. So does the political argument for focusing on spending cuts initially. Targeted spending cuts are typically more costly politically than general tax increases; thus it may be better to keep those tax increases in reserve for later, if and when fatigue is settling in. **Wider application?** If my list is about right, one cannot avoid the question of how many of these conditions apply to Europe's southern periphery countries. The sad truth is that many of these conditions are not satisfied elsewhere. True, the adjustments that these countries have to make are smaller than those Latvia had to make. But their economies are less flexible, less open. They have less obvious potential gains in productivity, at least in the tradables sector. They had much higher public debt to start. So, the lessons are not easily exportable. And we should be under no illusion that the adjustment in the South will be difficult and painful. In that context, the argument for a social pact, and faster joint adjustment of wages and prices than implied by market mechanisms and the downward pressure from unemployment, remains, in my mind, a very strong one.

What happens if they start reducing their exposure to the region? The largest borrowers from European banks are Australia, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China, while China, India, and the economies of South East Asia generally have smaller liabilities. Among European banks, those from the United Kingdom have a particularly significant presence in Asia. For most regional economies, the nonbank private sector'businesses and households'is the main recipient of credit from foreign banks as a whole. #### **Prominent role** European banks play a prominent role in the areas of **trade** credit and specialized** project financing**. In several Asian economies, however, lending by local subsidiaries and branches is funded primarily by **local deposits**, reducing potential deleveraging pressures. In Australia, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China, the domestic banking sectors are relatively more reliant on European banks for wholesale funding, increasing their vulnerability to deleveraging through the financial system. It appears that European banks have already started deleveraging from Asia. So far this has been a gradual process, partially offset by regional banks stepping in. But what would happen if the process gathered pace and became a disorderly rush for the exits? #### Hints from the past One way to shed light on this question is to examine what happened the last time around, in 2008, a year that encompassed both the Bear Stearns sale and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. We find that deleveraging by European banks during 2008 led to a large contraction in credit supply in destination countries. But while the credit contraction in Asian economies in response to the deleveraging was substantial, **the size of the response was smaller'by about 50 percent**'than that for a broad sample of countries. What explains this smaller credit contraction in Asia? We explore two possible explanations for a more muted transmission in Asia: a **stronger policy response** and **healthier balance sheets** in local Asian banking systems. #### More vigorous response The evidence suggests that the monetary'and to a lesser extent the fiscal'policy response in Asia was more vigorous than in other regions. In addition, Asian countries also took a number of measures to maintain market confidence and stabilize financial markets. These included instituting liquidity guarantees, negotiating Federal Reserve swap lines, strengthening regional reserve pooling, expanding deposit insurance, and supporting trade finance and SME programs. #### Lower debt to equity ratios The second reason for the more subdued impact of foreign deleveraging could be that Asia's local banking systems had healthier balance sheets entering the crisis. This is supported by the fact that Asian financial firms had lower leverage ratios'the ratio of debt to equity'relative to global peers. #### **How Could Asia Handle a Future Shock?** Going forward, while the space for a macroeconomic policy response is smaller than it was entering the global financial crisis, **Asia's policymakers still have ample room to react appropriately** to a sharp deleveraging of foreign banks arising from a euro area shock. In addition, capital adequacy ratios, which exceed regulatory norms in most economies, and low nonperforming loan ratios, combined with room to offer liquidity support, suggest that** relatively healthy local banking systems** should also provide a buffer, as they did in the wake of the global financial crisis.

Private consumption is growing at a rate comparable to pre-crisis levels, but investment has not regained its strength. The culprit is **corporate investment**: its share in GDP has fallen to about 10 percent--4 percentage points lower than that in 2007/08. This is a serious concern as [India needs more supply capacity. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Subbarao recently said that India's 'non- inflationary rate of [growth is about 7 percent,'\u009d down from 8.5 percent before the global financial crisis, suggesting that supply constraints'for example in power, coal, and land'have become increasingly binding. Many reasons have been put forward to explain the investment malaise. Some analysts focus on the spillover effects of weak and uncertain global growth and point to the fact that Indian companies are increasingly factoring in global supply and demand when making investment decisions. Others have blamed the RBI for raising interest rates (though they were recently lowered). But weaker investment has also been attributed to a host of other factors: slower project approvals and clearances; shortages in power and coal; governance issues; inflation; policy uncertainty; and limited progress with reforms. The list is long. #### Confluence of factors Of course, as usual in economics, it's not just one factor, but a confluence of causes. Admittedly, this is not a very satisfactory answer, so to shed some light on this issue, we have analyzed the data in a recent IMF [Working Paper. What does our study show? First, a bird's eye view. Investment data from the national accounts indicate that in explaining the decline in corporate investment between 2006/07 and 2010/11, inflation and its volatility contributed five times more than global economic conditions. Meanwhile, lower domestic growth had a small impact. Real interest rates actually helped investment as they were lower in 2010/11 than in 2006/07. So from our analysis, we can conclude that domestic factors, but not real interest rates, were the main cause of the slowdown. Another interesting finding is that macro variables alone cannot fully explain the weakness in investment in recent quarters: this suggests that other causes, such as [structural factors that affect the business environment, were also at play. #### Missing culprits To try to get a handle on the missing culprits, we zoomed in and looked at firm-level data for over 1,000 companies across 12 cities. We found that their capital expenditure depends on their profitability, leverage, and liquidity. This is a fairly standard result; the finding that cash holdings matter indicates that there is room to improve access to credit. However, corporates' liquidity position has not deteriorated substantially over the past few years and financial sector reforms'for example, interest rates have been fully liberalized, measures have been taken to help develop the corporate bond market and fund infrastructure'have advanced. Instead, what has worsened appreciably has been corporate profitability, which has not returned to levels recorded before the global financial crisis. We thus searched for factors that might explain corporate profitability. We found that profitability is affected by business costs: things like the cost of starting a business, registering property, enforcing contracts, and the cost of exporting'the latter pointing to infrastructure being important to boost corporate profitability and investment. #### Creating a better business climate It is well appreciated that [India has substantial room for improving the business environment. The [World Economic Forum ranked India in 56th place in terms of its global competitiveness index in 2011 down from 49th place in 2009, reflecting weakening institutions (for example, transparency of government decision making) and relatively slow pace of infrastructure development. Equally, the authorities are keenly aware of this. In his budget speech, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, stated 'The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts in the past year.'\u009d 'Right now,\" the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, recently stated, \"we should focus on reviving the investment climate'\u009d. #### Difficult to change But how can India reduce business costs? This seems a hard nut to crack. Fortunately, India has a model of _its own _as large variations in the business environment exist across the country. For example, the costs of registering property and exporting vary substantially across cities: for registering property (in percent of property value), the best city has a cost which is a fifth of the most expensive city. This means that poorly performing cities and states could gain significantly by emulating their neighbors. We have estimated that reducing the average of each cost of doing business to the lowest among Indian cities could boost aggregate corporate investment by as much as 10 percent. This would be no small feat as just the direct demand impact could yield up to 1.5 percent of GDP, without counting the positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy. In short, India can learn from itself. *_ Kiichi Tokuoka is an Economist in the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department._ ", "index": 500}, {"pub": "6/1/2012", "title": "Latvia Beat the Odds\u00e2\u20ac\u0094But the Battle Is Far From Over", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5149", "content": " [By [Mark Griffiths **Latvia**, a nation of about 2.2 million people bordering the Baltic Sea, went through the most extreme boom-bust cycle of the emerging market countries of Europe, and was among the first to ask for financial assistance from the international community. Back in the dark days of December 2008, many doubted that Latvia'which joined the European Union in 2004 together with its Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania'would be able to stick to the tough economic program it had just agreed with the IMF and the European Union. But it did. Against the odds, it successfully completed its IMF-supported program in December 2011. Over the past three years, I have worked closely with the Latvian authorities in my capacity as IMF mission chief. Worked with them'but learnt from them too. #### **A successful comeback** Today, **Latvia is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union**. Real GDP grew by 5\u00c2? percent in 2011, and is now projected to expand by 3\u00c2? percent in 2012, a number that possibly will come out even higher. Latvia has also successfully returned to international capital markets. It has issued two eurobonds since mid-2011, and is now rated at investment grade. The turnaround has been incredible. Of course, there is more to be done. It's no longer 'Mission Impossible'\u009d'but it's also too soon to say 'Mission Accomplished.'\u009d Latvia is still one of the poorest and most unequal countries in the EU, and unemployment remains unacceptably high at more than 15 percent. There has been considerable migration. Some estimates suggest as many as 200,000 people (just under one tenth of the population)'mainly the young and educated'have left Latvia over the past decade for opportunities elsewhere. So what are the remaining challenges? I see three main ones: * Meeting the criteria for joining the euro in 2014 * Staying competitive within the eurozone * Developing a strategy to make growth more inclusive. #### **Meeting the criteria and joining the euro** From the start, adopting the euro was the program's exit strategy. This gave economic policy a strong anchor, and helped the government stick to the program. Adopting the euro would: * remove exchange rate risk'particularly for borrowers (90 percent of loans are currently denominated in foreign currency) * reduce interest rates for both the public and private sector * increase Latvia's integration into the single market It's true that the euro now faces new uncertainties'ones that, it's fair to say, we hadn't anticipated when the program was drawn up. But these uncertainties only make it more important for Latvia to stick to its record of fiscal discipline so that its economy can continue to flourish. Adopting the euro of course also implies challenges, just like under the fixed exchange rate. While Latvia's recent record shows it is ready to adjust within a currency union, it will need to focus on continuing to improve its competitiveness. This brings me to what I see as the second main challenge. #### **Growing within the euro area** To avoid the fate of the crisis-hit countries in the eurozone periphery, Latvia will have to stay nimble once it adopts the euro. In a context where the exchange rate cannot be devalued, improving competitiveness is the only viable way to create new jobs. And that can only be achieved through structural reforms that promote productivity growth in the traded goods sector. Key challenges include: * increasing labor productivity by improving the quality of education * strengthening the investment climate * increasing product market competition to ensure that productivity gains translate into an overall improvement in competiveness * To survive under a fixed exchange rate or common currency, fiscal policy will also need to remain disciplined. Here, the proposed Fiscal Discipline Law is a good step in the right direction. #### **Making growth inclusive** To improve the welfare of its citizens, Latvia needs growth but, above all, inclusive growth. The starting level is not good. Income levels are only about half the EU average, and income inequality is one of the highest in the EU. Unemployment rose from 6 to 21 percent during the crisis, and is still high at more than 15 percent. And yet, as a percent of GDP, Latvia only spends half the EU average on social programs. To compensate for the increase in hardship caused by wage and job cuts, the IMF'working with the World Bank and the European Commission'encouraged measures under the program to expand and improve the targeting of social assistance. Measures included extending the duration and coverage of unemployment benefits, and increasing health benefits for the poor. The program also strongly supported job-creating policies, including on-the- job training programs and public works programs such as the '100 Lats'\u009d program (a workplace-with-stipend program which pays L100 or '\u00ac140 per month). After the program ended, the IMF has continued to encourage the government to strengthen the social safety net by improving incentives to work and ensuring social benefits are targeted to those who need them the most. #### **In sum** The recovery in Latvia demonstrates that adjustment under a fixed exchange rate _is_ possible. But the huge decline in output, and increase in unemployment and hardship, also tells us beyond any doubt that adjustment has been painful. Latvia's experience will be discussed at a conference titled '_Against the Odds'Lessons from the Recovery in the Baltics_.'\u009d The [conference, jointly organized by the IMF and the Bank of Latvia, will see the likes of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard, EU Commissioner Olli Rehn, J\u00c3\u00b6rg Asmussen of the European Central Bank, and Giancarlo Corsetti from Cambridge University debate whether the lessons from the recovery in the Baltics are applicable elsewhere, including in the crisis-stricken countries in the eurozone.

That is, rebalancing in terms of reduced dependence on exports, and increasing reliance on the domestic market by boosting consumer demand. My own opinion is that it is too early to say. True, China's [current account surplus fell to around 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2011, from a pre- crisis peak of more than 10 percent in 2007. And while the reduction in China's current account surplus is welcome news, we remain concerned that these changes may not represent a sustained, downward trend. One possible sign of a durable turnaround in China's current account surplus would be a pickup in **consumption** growth but there is little evidence that consumption is rising as a share of GDP. But then if the rebalancing is not driven by greater domestic consumption, what might be the other forces behind the decline in China's current account surplus? Cyclical forces have played a role. Since 2008, growth and demand has been severely damaged by the global [financial crisis.[ The impact on China's export sector is obvious: for example, exports of machinery and equipment to the United States contributed 10-15 percent of China's overall export growth in the early 200s. This figure is now around 5 percent. Simultaneously, the higher demand for imported minerals and energy was a result of China's huge, infrastructure-driven stimulus against the global recession, funded by massive injections of new credit. #### Worsening terms of trade Yes, more lasting forces _did _contribute to the reduction in China's trade surplus. Strong Chinese demand for [commodities and minerals-which contributed to rising global prices for these products-was compounded by falling prices for the country's exports of machinery and equipment, all of which reinforced a steady deterioration in the country's terms of trade. (A pattern familiar to other export-driven economies like Japan and Korea who experienced a similar trend as they proceeded along the path of development.) So, worsening terms of trade, and the persistent strength of imports tied to investment spending have had a substantial impact on China's current account surplus. Economists here at the IMF suggest they account for close to two- thirds of that decline since 2007. But as I said above, there is little evidence that consumption is rising as a share of GDP. Yes, China _is_ increasingly becoming a source of final consumer demand for the world economy, but its imports of consumer goods are growing at a slower pace than its imports of machinery and equipment. And in our recently released [_World Economic Outlook_, IMF economists said they expected China's account surplus to rise again to around 4-4\u00c2? percent by 2017, albeit with a great deal of uncertainty thrown in about the country's structural changes. China's 12th Five Year Plan is very much focused on raising household income, boosting consumption, and expanding the service sector. If its proposed structural reforms to catalyze consumer spending are successful, China has the potential to successfully achieve an unambiguously consumption-driven decline in its external imbalance. Now that really would be a rebalancing act worth celebrating. **_What does this mean for China's Asian trading partners?_** **Asian trading partners** have benefited from China's strong demand for [commodities and capital goods. While China has become a growing source of demand for other countries in the region, its demand for investment goods has risen more sharply than its demand for consumer goods, generally by a ratio of 2 to 1. For Asia's leading capital goods exporters **Japan** and **Korea**, China accounts for 20-25 percent of their total capital goods exports, a fourfold increase from a decade earlier. However, with rebalancing in China requiring a shift toward consumption-led growth, regional trading partners would also have to adapt to benefit from such a shift. For starters, despite rapid growth, China's role as an importer of consumer goods is still small, as it only accounts for 2 percent of global consumer goods imports. Second, Chinese consumers have increasingly turned towards domestically produced goods as China's share in global consumer goods imports has fallen behind its share in global consumption. Asian trading partners have also benefitted from growing export links with China as Asia's supply chain hub. China today accounts for more than 50 percent of all intraregional intermediate goods imports, twice its share in the mid 1990s, and making it the center of Asia's supply chain. As a result of greater vertical integration, Asian economies' exports to China have increasingly been driven by the success of China's exports in world markets. This means however, that if the rapid growth of Chinese exports slows, Asian trading partners would also face significant headwinds. These headwinds would become stronger if China were to 'on-shore'\u009d a larger chunk of the regional supply chain. In sum, the net benefits for Asian trading partners from rebalancing in China would be larger and more lasting, if they are able to increase their direct and indirect access to Chinese consumers.

This would appear to suggest that economic activity in Brazil's neighbors is strongly influenced by Brazil's business cycle. But these close comovements could also reflect common global factors that affect all South American countries similarly, such as commodity prices, international financial conditions, and global demand. Our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Western Hemisphere_ examines this question, quantifying the importance of spillovers from Brazil to the rest of South America. [ #### **What are the linkages?** Trade linkages are the likely channel of transmission between Brazil and its neighbors. Direct financial ties, the other common channel, are almost negligible. Although intraregional trade in [South America increased markedly in the past decade, trade with Brazil contributed only marginally to this process. Brazil's share in total exports of its neighbors dropped in the early 2000s and reverted to the levels of the early 1990s. The story, however, varies significantly across countries. **Southern Cone** economies (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and'to a lesser extent'Chile) have relatively high export exposures to Brazil (measured both as percent of total exports and as a percent of GDP). **Andean countries** (Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela), on the other hand, have very limited trade linkages with the region's giant'less than 3 percent of total exports or \u00c2? percent of GDP.[ This evidence suggests that the high comovements in economic activity between **Brazil and most South American countries**, are indicative of an exposure to spillovers from Brazil only in the case of the Southern Cone countries. #### **Neighborly spillovers** We use a statistical approach'covering the period 1990'2011'that allows us to strip the effects of common external factors to quantify spillovers from the large neighbor. The results confirm that Brazil has a significant influence on Southern Cone countries, particularly on Mercosur partners (Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay), but not on the Andean economies. For the Southern Cone countries, spillovers from Brazil can take two forms: the transmission of shocks originating in Brazil and the amplification (through Brazil) of global shocks. These two factors explain an important share of the fluctuations in economy activity in the Southern Cone countries. [ **Impact of Brazilian _real_ depreciation** We also assess the impact of Brazil's currency depreciation on the business cycle of the South American economies. Interestingly, our analysis finds no evidence of a significant impact of such a shock, even on Southern Cone countries. We interpret these results as suggesting that the dampening effect on output of neighboring countries resulting from the appreciation of their bilateral real exchange rate vis-\u00c3 -vis Brazil is largely offset by the expansionary effect of the depreciation on Brazil's output and domestic demand.

GDP growth fell throughout 2011, from a high of 7.8 percent at the beginning of the year to 6.1 percent in the quarter ending in December. The slowdown in the economy has affected the industrial sector particularly hard and has extended to 2012 as shown by the 3.5 percent contraction (y/y) in March industrial production. For 2012/13, we at the IMF [project that GDP growth is likely to be about 7 percent. While India has been affected by the [worldwide slowdown, many observers have started to question the inner strength of the Indian growth story. By international standards 7 percent growth is still very robust, but it sometimes feels like underachievement for a country that was growing at more than 9 percent just a few years ago. **** #### Investment sees drop The slowdown in growth has been primarily due to falling investment. Investment reached 38 percent of GDP in 2007/08, just before the onset of the global financial crisis, lifting growth to nearly 10 percent. But** investment growth subsequently dropped sharply**, crossing into negative territory for the last two quarters of 2011. This downturn is unprecedented. With the exception of the September-December quarter of 2008, one would have to go back to the last quarter of 2001' more than a decade'to find a year in which investment fell. Since quarterly national accounts have been compiled, no consecutive declines in investment were recorded until 2011. The weakness in investment has been mainly due to domestic factors, such as high and volatile inflation, but not real interest rates. However, macro variables alone cannot fully explain the weakness in investment in recent quarters, suggesting that other causes, such as structural factors that affect the business environment, were also at play. We'll discuss investment in India in a subsequent posting. Regardless of its [causes, the slowdown in investment has far reaching implications for growth, particularly if it lasts. First, investment is a component of aggregate demand, so to reach a given rate of growth, its decline has to be offset elsewhere. Second, and far more important, lower investment translates into lower productive capacity, and lower average growth over time. Practitioners of the dismal science often use the rule of thumb (estimated for a large group of countries) that a one percent of GDP decline in investment could lower trend growth by about 0.3 percent. To give an idea of what that means for India, the decline of share of investment in GDP by 3.7 percentage points since the global financial crisis could lower trend growth by slightly more than one percentage point. While this may not seem much to some, the long-run implications are daunting: income per capita would be nearly US$1,000 lower in 20 years (more than 50 percent of _today's_ income per capita) if the economy were to settle at a growth rate of 7 percent instead of 8 percent. #### Holding back growth India's long-run challenges have turned into short-run problems. **Supply constraints**, particular in power, mining and land, have become increasingly binding. As these constraints have raised costs and inflation, investor sentiment has suffered. But other measures to remove bottlenecks also matter, such as streamlining taxation through the Goods and Services Tax and facilitating business investment via additional financial reforms (especially for the corporate bond market). Facilitating **trade** and easing **labor** regulations would also boost productivity and enable India to harness its huge and mostly young population by creating more jobs, as would **education** improvements by improving people's skills. **Fiscal consolidation** and reforms are essential complements to many of these reforms, and their implementation would increase resiliency and make growth more inclusive. Reducing inflation in a durable way is the best contribution that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could make to rapid and sustainable growth. The good news is that policies can make a big difference. Right now, the government can boost investor sentiment by accelerating the pace of project approvals and launching high impact reform initiatives such as rationalizing fuel subsidies or further liberalization of foreign direct investment rules. These steps could signal a turnaround and be catalysts for other reforms. Addressing problems in the **power** and** coal** sector is the immediate priority given the linkages across all sectors in the economy. The latest budget begins this process with some financial reforms, measures to broaden the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs), and an enhanced role for UDIs (unique identification numbers) in targeting government programs, which could improve the efficiency of spending. The RBI has continued to implement financial reforms to facilitate infrastructure financing, improve the transmission of monetary policy, and promote financial inclusion. If these positive signs are quickly followed by bolder government action, the recent slowdown would have a silver lining. _ _ ", "index": 504}, {"pub": "5/22/2012", "title": "Without Better Data, Middle East Policymakers Risk Getting Lost", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=5088", "content": " [By [Nemat Shafik (Version in[ \u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) Recently I went orienteering with my children as part of a school trip. Orienteering is a sport whereby you have to find your way to various checkpoints through unknown terrain with only a compass and a topographical map. Wandering through the woods with six 9-year-olds was a good lesson in the value of good directions and data to find your way when you are in unchartered territory. Likewise, making policy decisions without adequate and timely data would also result in getting lost, wasting time and money, and making policy mistakes with obvious negative consequences for growth and development. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region suffers significant shortcoming in data, which are particularly problematic at a time economic transition (see table below). There are important data gaps, poor data quality and in many cases, internationally agreed standards of statistical methodologies, compilation periodicity and timeliness, and data dissemination practices are not followed. I emphasized these issues during my participation at the [ArabStat Conference in Morocco this month. #### Gaps in standards In MENA, accordance with internationally accepted statistical methodologies lags behind other regions in most data categories. IMF reports found that the main [data shortcomings occur in the national accounts, government finance, and external sector data. In compiling consumer price statistics, for instance, only 17 percent of countries in MENA follow the internationally accepted methodology. These gaps hamper proper assessment of economic trends, effective policy formulation, and pre-emptive prediction of risks. Meteorologists cannot make forecasts without sufficient and high-quality data. Nor can economists or private investors for that matter. More accurate and reliable macroeconomic statistics pave the way for more effective policy making and provide investors with the necessary data to make informed decisions. Efforts in this direction have been made across MENA, but more needs to be done to bring statistical systems to a level comparable to other regions. #### What is needed More transparency and wider public data dissemination are called for, as is the adoption of statistical laws that stress the independence of statistical agencies from political interference. To these ends, we see great merit in a regional statistical body'**ArabStat**'that would coordinate activities among national statistical agencies and bring MENA's statistical systems in line with international standards. As in other regions, the purpose of such a body would be to take the lead in promoting the production and dissemination of data at the country and regional level. It would spearhead efforts to improve data quality to meet international standards and offer a forum to foster collaboration and enhance coordination across national statistical agencies to harmonize statistical methodologies and data dissemination practices. **The role of the IMF** The IMF is not only a major consumer of [statistics, but also promotes transparency and compiles and disseminates [data. We launched the Special Data Dissemination Standard ([SDDS) in 1996 to guide countries that have, or seek to have, access to international capital markets in providing their economic and financial data to the public; and the General Data Dissemination System ([GDDS) in 1997 to guide member countries in developing plans for statistical improvement. Both of these initiatives have been very successful. Subscribing to the SDDS is somewhat a proxy of statistical development and political commitment to disseminate data according to stringent and well- defined periodicity and timeliness. Unfortunately, only 5 MENA countries are currently subscribed to SDDS. In addition, GDDS participants from the MENA region are less successful in meeting the periodicity and timeliness guidelines compared to members from other regions. Nevertheless, several countries in the region have been successful in improving reporting on portfolio investment (Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, and Lebanon) and financial soundness (Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and West Bank and Gaza) ' which shows progress can be made where there is commitment. The MENA region, with support from the IMF, needs to invest more in improving statistics. 'Good statistics are cheaper than bad policy,'\u009d said one official at the conference. We will continue to work with governments across the region on improving statistical systems that will help guide the formulation of sound policies and ensure a safe and smooth journey at an important time for the region.

This is a critical issue for policymakers, perhaps the most important one in the short run. And yet, this [debate'which, _mea culpa_, I have myself [contributed to'is attracting too much attention. This is bad for two reasons: * The **debate is driven, to some degree, by ideology** and is therefore more focused on the relatively limited areas of disagreement than on the far broader areas of agreement. Most economists would agree that fiscal consolidation is needed in advanced economies, and that the average annual pace of adjustment during 2011-12'about 1 percentage point'is [neither too aggressive nor excessively slow. Most economists would also agree that countries under pressure from markets have to adjust at a faster pace, while those that do not face such constraints have more time. Of course, there is disagreement on some aspects of the fiscal strategy, but it relates to specific country cases. * The debate is **detracting attention from policy issues** that may seem less urgent, but which are nevertheless critical in the medium term. I am referring to what I would call the institutional gaps in fiscal policymaking that still exist in most advanced and emerging economies. **These gaps have contributed to a bias in the conduct of fiscal policy in favor of deficits that is behind many of the current problems**. #### **The deficit bias** Since the [collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, it has been pretty obvious that there is a **bias in favor of increasing public debt levels**. Even before the global economic crisis hit in 2008, the average public debt-to-GDP ratio for advanced economies was at its [highest level ever during the past 130 years, surpassed only by the [Second World War. On average, the public debt-to-GDP ratio [increased from 29 percent in 1974 of GDP to 74 percent of GDP in 2007. During this period, the debt ratio surged during bad times but did not decline in good times. In some countries where public debt appeared to be low before the crisis (examples include Iceland, Ireland, Spain and United Kingdom), no consideration had been given to the exposure of these countries' fiscal accounts to large risks linked to the size of their financial sector and revenues that were boosted by factors that turned out to be transitory. In emerging economies, fiscal accounts currently appear to be in reasonably good shape. This group of countries has been growing at unprecedented rates for almost a decade (with the brief exception of 2009), and many have benefitted from high commodity prices. And yet, 40 percent of them (representing some 60 percent of emerging market debt) still has a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the 40 percent threshold that is often considered prudent for this country group. In many of these economies, financial repression (the use of various measures to channel funds to the government) is still used to facilitate the financing of public debt. #### **Plugging the gaps** In order to overcome the bias in fiscal policymaking in favor of deficits, several institutional gaps need fixing. They relate to: * **budgetary processes** that are too focused on the short term * a lack of **transparency** in fiscal accounts * inadequate comparability of **information** across countries * **governance** issues Let me address each in turn. #### **Planning for the future** In most countries, the [budgetary process is essentially a short-term (annual) business. In the United States, for example, which faces severe'and largely unaddressed'medium-term fiscal challenges, much more progress is needed in establishing a binding multi-year budgetary framework. But the focus on the medium term is lacking in several other countries as well. While medium-term forecasts are prepared in many countries, they do not really constrain policy decisions in any meaningful way. The result is a focus on short-term developments, rather than underlying trends, which often implies a bias towards procyclical policies during high growth periods, and insufficient attention being given to long-term spending pressures, such as those related to [age- related spending. This short-termism also hampers policy planning. For instance, spending reviews aimed at assessing the medium-term effectiveness and financial impact of certain government policies are still absent even in advanced economies'Italy, for example, is only now moving more forcefully in this direction. Budgeting is also too focused on cash, rather than accrual, measures, which again often implies a short-term bias. #### **Being open and transparent** Transparency is far from adequate. Hidden fiscal imbalances have emerged in some European economies (Greece and Portugal come to mind), with negative consequences for the credibility of policymaking in these countries. Spain announced it would miss its fiscal deficit target by over 2 percentage points at end-2011. Public debt in China was recently revised up by 17 percentage points of GDP, owing to previously unrecorded local government debt. And there are many more examples. One key issue is data coverage: less than half of the IMF's 188 member countries publish fiscal data beyond the central government, and few publish comprehensive information on public enterprises. The frequency of information is also inadequate. Monthly data are scarce, quarterly data often unreliable. Only seven countries publish fiscal risk assessments, thus preventing a full appreciation of the exposure to shocks. Very few publish balance sheet data on assets and liabilities. No private firm would be allowed to operate, let alone issue securities, with such a limited degree of transparency. #### **Comparing apples and oranges** International comparisons of fiscal trends are hampered by [idiosyncratic accounting and budgetary practices. There are well-established accounting standards for private firms. Standards have been developed for the public sector too, but most countries do not pay much attention to them. In the European Union, a directive was issued only last year to bring some order to government accounting, and even then, it was framed in fairly general terms. International statistical standards also exist (including the Government Financial Statistics Manual of the [IMF), but they are not adhered to closely. For example, countries report widely varying definitions of financial assets held by governments. Gross debt definitions are also inconsistent. For example, Japan does not net out intra-governmental debt holdings in its general government debt figures, as most other countries do. The IMF has recently intensified its efforts to publish a fully harmonized definition of government debt'an initiative which over time will have to be broadened to other statistics. #### **Checks and balances** Finally, there is the issue of governance'who is in charge of making decisions about income and expenditure. This is a delicate issue. Surely the approach followed for monetary policy'giving unelected officials the ultimate control of key policy decisions'is impossible for fiscal policy. Fiscal policy decisions redistribute income both across groups of citizens and across generations. As such, they must be taken by parliaments. However, more progress must be made in allowing for an assessment of fiscal policy trends, risks and policies by independent agencies'often referred to as fiscal councils. One example that comes to mind is the Fiscal Policy Council in Sweden, but there are others. The introduction of fiscal councils has been encouraged in the euro area by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and is a requirement under the recently signed intergovernmental Fiscal Compact. But fiscal councils are still relatively uncommon, particularly in emerging economies, with a recent remarkable step backwards in at least one prominent case in emerging Europe. #### **If the gap is not closed . . .**** ** The importance of fiscal institutions was discussed recently at a [conference in Stockholm organized jointly by the Swedish Ministry of Finance and the [IMF. During the final panel, [Eric Leeper of Indiana University underscored that there is a gap between our knowledge of the way fiscal policy works and the way monetary policy works. He is right. But equally important is the gap that exists when it comes to fiscal and monetary institutions. **If this gap is not closed, the deficit bias will persist**. We risk seeing debt stabilize at new record-high levels, and not being brought down to more manageable levels once the good times are back. Their exposure to shocks will thus be even higher than it was in 2007.

What strikes you on a trip to the Middle East is that everyone is talking politics'all of the time. That had been the case in countries like Lebanon where it is a national pastime, but it is a new phenomenon in countries across North Africa and the Gulf. Constitutions are being rewritten, political parties and youth groups are vibrant, and everyone has an opinion on current events. The older generation seems worried by the uncertainty associated with change. The young generation continues to be energized. #### Need for an economic rethink But, what I noticed during a week of travel through the region is that **almost no one is talking economics, and that is a worry**. Because while 2011 was a year of major transitions in the political domain, almost every economic indicator in the non-oil countries went in the wrong direction. Growth halved, unemployment rose, reserves came under pressure and deficits ballooned as governments responded to social pressures by increasing spending on wages and generalized [subsidies. New governments across the region are keen to respond to the demand for [jobs and justice that brought them to power but are quickly faced with the hard reality of limited resources and powerful vested interests. So, just as the \"[**Arab Spring**\" opened a debate about politics in the Middle East, we now need an \"**Economic Spring**\" on how to rethink the region's economic future. Of course each country will have to define its own strategy, but there will be some common issues that will have to be addressed. How can countries move away from generalized [subsidies to ones targeting the poor to free up resources to invest in improving the education system and infrastructure? How can tax systems become fairer so that the poorest can be given a minimum standard of living? Given bloated public sectors, how will the private sector be induced to create the 50-75 million [jobs needed in the next decade? Unfortunately, there is not yet any real discourse about these issues. #### Tougher environment The region has to make this historic transition in a [much tougher external environment than that which faced Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the 1990s the world economy was booming, Europe was keen to embrace the transition countries by providing a policy anchor through membership of the European Union, and external finance was readily available. None of these conditions are the same for [MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) today and while there is willingness from the international community to help, resources are limited. Most of the economic transition in MENA will have to be financed through domestic resources and that means the numbers need to add up. Launching such a debate in the months ahead is essential. It must be indigenous and engage the younger generation whose [economic futures are at stake -- both their job prospects and the debts that will have to be repaid if their economies are mismanaged. It was refreshing to listen to students from universities in Beirut during a [presentation I gave at the American University in Beirut ([AUB). They had many questions on the economy and the implications for their futures. There was obvious energy and talent in the room as well as worry about what lay ahead for them. Their concerns ranged from the need for better access to education, to jobs, to protecting the environment. They also commented about the need for transparency in public finances and how the IMF can help address the many challenges facing the region. This visit to the region, has made me more convinced that without an \"Economic Spring\" to accompany the \"Arab Spring\" and the important political transitions taking place in the Arab region, we risk failure on both fronts.

Here's the good news: thanks to relatively strong fundamentals and good policies, **Asian economies have coped well with the global market turbulence** of recent years. Now the bad: a major financial shock'say, of type ignited by the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008'is likely to have a substantial impact on Asia. The reason: Asia's **increasing financial interconnectedness**. Over the past two decades'in line with the region's growing role in the global economy'Asia's equity markets have become increasingly sensitive to global financial developments. More specifically, we have discovered that equity returns in Asia generally now move in tandem with those in systemic economies. (By systemic economies, we are talking here about those countries'such as the United States and the United Kingdom which are home to major, global, financial centers such as Wall Street and the City of London.) How do we measure that degree of financial interconnectedness? Or put another way, how do we measure the relationship'if any'between those Asian equity returns and the performance of systemic economies? #### **Tracking interconnectedness** The answer: by tracking **Asian financial 'betas'\u009d** which measure volatility and capture the impact of the systemic economies on Asian equities. These betas describe the fluctuations of those equities in relation to the fluctuations of the benchmark-in this case, the performance of large, systemic economies. A **positive beta** means that the asset's returns generally follow the market's returns, while a **negative beta** means that the asset's returns are generally unmoved by the market. Asian financial betas have followed a modest, but steady upward trend over the past two decades. This is easily seen in a graph showing Asian financial betas and global financial shocks. [ A spike on the graph'whether it represents the bursting of the technology bubble, or more recently, the turmoil in the euro area'is mirrored by a similar spike in Asian financial betas. An example of that increasing financial interconnectedness is the global financial shock associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy which explains nearly 90 percent of the pickup in financial betas across Asia from 2002'07 to 2008'11. Those financial betas differ from country-to-country. For example, **East Asia** (including Singapore and Hong Kong, SAR) has the highest financial betas. That is, they tended to be more financially integrated and so mirror global ups and downs more closely, whereas countries which pursued a more gradual pace of capital market integration, such as **China**, generally had lower financial sensitivity to the systemic economies. #### No longer insulated But on the whole, given the now high'and increasing'financial interconnections, Asian markets will never be completely insulated against major global financial shocks. So far, so bad. But to be clear, this isn't an argument for Asia's policymakers to fold their arms and stand helpless in the face of financial globalization. On the contrary, one of the main conclusions of our research is that macroeconomic policies matter. The choices made by Asia's policymakers can help determine the region's financial betas. For example, a lower government debt-to-GDP ratio, and a higher stock of international reserves, but up to a limit, are associated with lower financial betas. Sound macroeconomic policy frameworks are associated with lower financial betas in Asia during both tranquil and turbulent periods and sound macroeconomic policies may yet limit the impact of major downside risks on the real economy.

It reads like a script for a Hollywood movie'a poor protagonist happens upon an opportunity that has the potential of bestowing riches, but an evil curse threatens to spoil it all. Unfortunately, it's not a movie script. The scenario plays out repeatedly in many parts of the real world all the time. For many developing countries, managing [natural resources and the increased revenues they bring is a tough haul. Cue the extensive literature on the '[resource curse'\u009d and the lack of consensus on how to run fiscal policy and manage budgets in resource- rich countries. In some respects, this _is _like the 'all-too-similar'\u009d sequel, because the tribulations associated with how to best [manage natural resources, such as oil, minerals, and gas, seem to endure so that resource-rich developing countries are never quite free of them. #### **The 'resource curse'\u009d and fiscal policy** High commodity prices and the discovery of new reserves offer the potential for much needed [revenue in many developing countries**'**revenues that should help promote economic and social development, build human capital, and reduce [infrastructure gaps in resource-rich countries. In a [new study, my co- authors and I look at how to manage fiscal policy to achieve those goals while avoiding previous pitfalls. The design of fiscal policy frameworks for resource-rich developing countries is beset by trade-offs and tensions. In fact, the volatility, uncertainty, and exhaustibility of revenues earned from resources have to be taken into account when formulating a scaling up of public spending. * How to ensure short-term macroeconomic and fiscal stability? * How to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability and adequate savings for future generations while allocating sufficient resources to meet development needs? * How to address absorption capacity constraints that could limit the quality and effectiveness of scaled-up spending? These are important questions that many politicians, policymakers, and economists face in such countries. Recent academic and empirical work has enhanced the debate on this issue. On the one hand, such work has brought to the fore the need to avoid rigid policy formulations that would force countries with substantial development needs to keep the consumption of their resource wealth at a constant level over time (that is, borrowing at the beginning, saving when income is high, and lowering the rate of saving as income tapers off). While persuasive, such work hasn't offered practical approaches to managing fiscal policy in those countries and overemphasizes the role of resource funds, for example. So, how could fiscal frameworks for resource-rich countries be made more flexible in practice? In our study, we analyze this question from a practitioner's perspective, proposing specific options to effectively anchor fiscal policy while allowing for a sustainable scaling up of spending in the context of increased resource revenue. In laying out the options, our study emphasizes that there is not a 'one size fits all'\u009d approach since each country has its own set of economic and institutional circumstances to balance, such as resource revenue dependency, how long the reserves will last, and the country's development needs. Furthermore, the large volatility of revenues earned from natural resources and the difficulty to predict those swings would call for prudence and gradualism in scaling up spending and for flexible fiscal rules to adapt to new information and changing circumstances. #### Seven principles Accordingly, we propose the following principles to guide the formulation of fiscal policy frameworks in resource-rich developing countries: * The framework should reflect** country-specific characteristics** like revenue dependency and volatility as well as how long the resource revenue stream is expected to last'all of which may change over time. * It should ensure** the sustainability of fiscal policy.** Depending on how many years the natural resource is expected to last before it is depleted, benchmarks of sustainability can be derived from simple constant consumption approaches'particularly for countries with short-lasting reserves'or from a broader focus on stabilizing government net wealth (not now, but over the long run). * Policymakers can** choose alternative fiscal anchors**, either primarily addressing fiscal sustainability concerns (for example, permanently constant non-oil balance deficit rules) or focusing more on short-term demand management (such as a price-based or structural balance rule). Country characteristics should guide the choice of the appropriate fiscal anchor (see table below). * Frameworks should be** sufficiently flexible to enable the scaling up of growth-enhancing expenditure **(for example, public investment to tackle existing infrastructure gaps)**, **especially in low-income countries. * In countries with large absorption constraints,** the pace of scaling up may have to be gradual,** while public financial management systems are reinforced and domestic supply constraints softened. * The volatility and uncertainty of resource revenue is critical for the design of fiscal frameworks, and **having sufficient precautionary fiscal buffers is critical**. A strong revenue forecasting framework needs to be developed and spending plans framed in a medium-term perspective. * The credibility and transparency of the framework can be supported by** a well-designed natural resource fund.** But the fund cannot be a substitute for an appropriate policy framework nor a panacea that obviates the need to strengthen overall fiscal management capacity. Funds need to be fully integrated with the budget and the fiscal framework. **The complete framework would comprise three elements:** 1. _Fiscal policy indicators-_the best analytical measures of the actual stance of fiscal policy. 2. F_iscal sustainability benchmarks-_provide a way to assess fiscal policy with a longer-term perspective. 3. F_iscal policy anchors-_the rules or guidelines that would better fit resource-rich countries and their specific characteristics. The table below illustrates the more appropriate rules possible along two specific dimensions: the horizon of their resource reserves and the relative scarcity of capital.

Output levels in many advanced economies still remain below pre-crisis levels, while unemployment levels have surged; growth in emerging market economies has slowed, but remains quite high. But in sub-Saharan Africa,[ growth for the region as a whole has remained reasonably strong (around 5 percent), except for 2009 ' where the decline in world output and associated shrinking of world trade pushed Africa's growth down to below 3 percent. #### **Some better than others** **Of course, sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse region, and not all economies have fared equally well.** The more advanced economies in the region (notably [South Africa) have close links to export markets in the advanced economies, and have experienced a sharper slowdown, and weaker recovery, than did the bulk of the region's low-income economies. Countries affected by civil strife (such as Cote d'Ivoire, and now Mali) and by drought have also fared less well than other economies in the region. _So why has most of [sub-Saharan Africa continued to record solid growth against the backdrop of such a weak global economy?_ _And can we expect this solid growth performance to continue in the next few years?_ **First, the economic situation in sub-Saharan Africa has undergone a fundamental change since the beginning of the millennium**. As we show in the latest IMF _[Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa**'**_launched today in Lusaka, Zambia**_'_**the region has been growing consistently strongly for over a decade. Critical to the region's recent success has been the steady progress and economic resilience of the region's 26 low-income and fragile economies. Average per capita incomes in these countries is still well under $2 per day, but total output has grown by more than 5 percent in every year since 2004. Furthermore, the share of investment in this output has risen steadily - from 18 percent in 2004 to 23 percent now. This solid growth record has been supported by several factors, including significantly less civil conflict, the generally favorable commodity price developments benefiting Africa's natural resource exporters; and the extensive debt relief provided to most highly-indebted poor countries. But I would ascribe key importance to **sound policy choices** by African governments ' both in terms of pursuing appropriate macroeconomic policies and pressing ahead with important reform measures. Specifically,** **economic policies in the last decade have been directed firmly toward economic stability and [market liberalization. Inflation has been tamed, foreign reserves have risen, and debt burdens have been reduced. Fast-growing export markets in Asia have been tapped. The result has been rising [investment**_'_**domestic and foreign**_'_**the deepening of financial sectors, and stronger productivity growth. Second, **sub-Saharan Africa has been partially insulated from the adverse cyclical effects of the Great Recession because of a number of key factors. **Commodity prices for African natural resources have remained relatively high to date, sustained by the continued strong growth of major [emerging market economies, most notably[ China. African banking systems have not experienced the severe financial stresses recorded in the advance economies, in good part because they are not heavily dependent on external funding, relying instead on strong domestic deposit bases. And African policymakers were able to ease budgetary policies to support economic activity during this crisis, instead of being forced to cut outlays because of severe borrowing constraints as occurred in past downturns. #### **Looking ahead** **In 2011, output growth in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 5 percent.** In 2012, we_ _project that it could be a touch higher, buoyed by one-off surges in natural resource production and recovery from conflict and drought in western Africa. Looking beyond 2012, there is ground for solid confidence that growth rates at this pace can be sustained. **Not that everything is rosy.** Unacceptable levels of poverty and poor social conditions still plague the region. Employment growth lags behind most emerging markets, with much of the growth still in agriculture and traditional services. Progress toward the [Millennium Development Goals is too slow. And of course, with European finances still uncertain and geopolitical uncertainty troubling oil markets, the world economy could still take another turn for the worse. A resumed global downturn would hit African exports, investment, tourism, remittances, and aid flows to varying degree ' slowing the pace of regional growth for a period but not derailing it over the medium term. #### **Addressing risks** **What about new external risks?** As discussed in depth in the latest IMF_ [World Economic Outlook_, high among the possible global threats is a more sustained deleveraging in the euro area, which could throttle the already hesitant global recovery and, among other things, depress commodity prices. But equally disruptive to world growth would be another surge in oil prices because of rising political tensions. There would inevitably be adverse consequences for sub-Saharan Africa if either of these adverse shocks were to materialize. Although some oil importers would get relief from lower energy prices in the euro area downward scenario**_'_**and oil exporters would gain in the high oil price scenario**_'_**the general impact on the region in both circumstances would be slower growth, higher unemployment, and, in some cases, strained fiscal accounts. Mitigating action could nevertheless be taken. Many, if not most, countries have the fiscal space to maintain existing government spending plans even if revenues are reduced by slower growth. Special fiscal measures**_'_**such as cash grants to poor families or direct food assistance to school children to offset rising food costs**_'_**could help alleviate the impact on the most vulnerable in the event of sharply rising fuel prices. Monetary and exchange rate policies can also be supportive in countries with independent monetary autonomy'although in some countries, central banks will need to remain focused on reining in elevated inflation rates. Rest assured that the IMF would be standing by with financial support to support member countries experiencing severe stresses. Meanwhile, ahead of any storm, it is important that countries where growth is still strong take every opportunity to build up their policy buffers now through prudent fiscal policies. #### **Longer-term development** Lastly, but crucially, what about the more distant future? How does sub- Saharan Africa keep up its good growth performance? Mainly, I think, by staying the policy course. That means maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and improving the [business climate further. It also requires broadening the revenue base and modernizing public financial management so that essential spending**_'_**including on [infrastructure and public services**_'_**can be financed. It is also vital that we keep a focus on the young and on [inclusive growth. Better education, robust health, and realistic job opportunities are, in the long run, truly the only secure foundations to sustained prosperity.

The uprisings that spread across the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 taught us that even rapid economic growth cannot be maintained unless it is inclusive, creates [enough jobs for the growing labor force, and is accompanied by policies that protect the most vulnerable. And the absence of transparent and fair rules of the game will inevitably undermine the development process. Hopes after the revolutions are high and **so are people's expectations**. Hence, there is a need to pay more attention to [socioeconomic issues in making policy decisions. In my [speech today at the Arab Economic Forum in Beirut, I argued that we need an 'Economic Spring'\u009d to complement what has become known as the 'Arab Spring.'\u009d #### Gloomy picture needs attention At over 25 percent, the **youth unemployment** rate in the region's oil- importing countries exceeds that of any other region in the world'a rate that reaches up to 30 percent in Tunisia and 32 percent in Morocco. Ironically, education in the region is not a guarantee against unemployment. In fact, unemployment tends to increase with schooling, exceeding 15 percent for those with tertiary education in Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia. In many countries of the region, poverty rates are unacceptably high while human development indicators lag behind those of many others elsewhere according to reports by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program. #### How to make growth inclusive Medium-term economic strategies should focus on providing **economic opportunities to all**, including by providing equal and improved access to credit. Jobs cannot be created without aligning the education system to prepare graduates for what is needed in the modern labor market. Reforming the **labor market** itself is also needed to eliminate rigidities and boost job- creation. It is also vital to promote transparency and reduce red tape to help foster a business-friendly environment and advance the role of the private sector in the economy and, hence, create necessary jobs. Progress in this area would also help [bring the informal sector into the fold, which would spur the economy and promote more [inclusive growth. There is simply no other way to create the [50'70 million jobs needed for the people joining the labor force and to reduce unemployment over the next decade. Subsidy schemes, upon which many people depend, must also be well designed and targeted. The IMF estimates subsidies to cost about $210 billion, about 7 percent of the region's GDP. Budgeted food and fuel subsidies account for about 16 percent of GDP in Egypt and 12 percent of GDP in Jordan, for example. Yet, only 20 percent of those subsidies reach the poor while the remaining 80 percent benefit the non-needy. Price subsidies also encourage socially wasteful activities such as smuggling, black markets, and corruption. In Egypt, for example, price subsidies have reportedly led to the use of bread as animal and fish feed. Moreover, subsidized wheat ' which is supposed to be used in producing 'Baladi bread'\u009d ' often ends up being sold in the black market to bakery shops that make fancy cakes, while the poor stay for long hours for bread and not get enough to feed their families. There has been also report of smuggling of gasoline and diesel, while the black market is widespread in the case of subsidized bhutan gas cylinders, leading frequently to severe shortages and long waiting lines. To that end, replacing [wasteful subsidy regimes that benefit mostly the wealthy with targeted social safety nets that protect the poor should occupy a high place on any reform agenda. Resources freed up by better-targeted subsidies could then be used for investment in infrastructure, education, and health. Finally, it is important to realize that a socially inclusive agenda will only survive if it is homegrown and if economic and financial stability prevail. Therefore, sound macroeconomic policies are needed to keep inflation, which hurts the poor the most, and fiscal and external imbalances in check. #### How the IMF can help For its part, the International Monetary Fund is helping on three main fronts: policy advice, capacity building, and financing. On **policy advice**, we have adapted our analytical work to face the new realities on the ground by integrating the concept of inclusive growth more systematically in our policy advice. In this difficult environment, the IMF is promoting measures to increase spending on, and improve the targeting of, social safety net programs that can mitigate the impact of the great recession. We have also identified five areas critical to achieving more socially inclusive growth than in the past'job creation, better-targeted social safety nets, stronger governance and business environments, better access to finance, and greater trade access and integration. Regarding **capacity building**, our efforts in the region are focused on providing technical assistance and training that aim to build strong institutions, particularly in public finance management and banking supervision; develop equitable fiscal policies to ensure more fairness; and construct good data to create a solid basis on which policy decisions can be taken. This is where we see great merit in a regionally consolidated statistical body, namely ARABSTAT. Such an institution would be important for transparency and governance in the region as it would take the lead in promoting the production and dissemination of data at the country as well as regional level. It would also spearhead efforts in improving data quality to meet international standards. On **financing**, we have created new lending facilities and tools with [streamlined conditionality partly in response to the financing needs in the region and are mobilizing other official financing to fill short-term fiscal and external gaps in a number of countries. Also, as part of our efforts to protect vulnerable groups in the current difficult environment, program conditionality in most countries has included a commitment by the government to strengthen the use of resources for social safety nets. As part of a broader reform to make the IMF's financial support more flexible to address the diverse needs of member countries, the Fund has created the [Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and the [Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The RFI provides rapid financial assistance to all member countries facing an urgent balance of payments need. The PLL, on the other hand, provides financing to meet actual or potential balance of payments needs of countries with sound policies, and is intended to serve as insurance or help resolve crises under wide-ranging situations. We know that social exclusion and unemployment, especially among young people, are very painful and that the challenges ahead are formidable. We should not let the hopes and aspirations of the people who took to the street go unfulfilled. We must strive to ensure that the people of the Arab countries in transition have the opportunity for a fairer and more prosperous future.

Tovar, and [Evridiki Tsounta (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) Housing construction projects are sprouting up across much of **Latin America** and mortgage credit is also growing very fast. **Does this sound familiar?** It should! Easy external financing conditions and high commodity prices have led to important improvements in living standards and credit deepening in many countries of the region over the past decade. The credit expansion has been particularly impressive in the mortgage sector, where legal reforms and government subsidies have also played a role. Although mortgage credit in [Latin American countries is relatively low by international standards 'at just 7 percent of GDP versus over 20 percent in emerging Asia and over 65 percent in the [United States'it has grown at an impressive annual average real rate of 14 percent since 2003, with **Brazil** leading the pack. Home prices have also risen sharply over this period, particularly in countries where mortgage credit has expanded the fastest (for more details see Chapter 5 in our latest [_Western Hemisphere Regional Economic Outlook_). [ So, are housing vulnerabilities emerging? Policymakers and analysts in the region should be vigilant about rapidly growing mortgage credit and[ home prices because, as we know too well, they can create financial instability. ** **[Latin America has a long history of credit booms gone wrong and experience shows that while credit-driven asset price bubbles build slowly they can sour quickly. But then again, **Latin America has a large housing deficit**, so construction activity should be catching up as living standards improve and mortgage credit deepens from its very low base. A proper assessment of the situation is hindered by the** limited and weak information** available for the real estate sector in Latin America. **Patchy information** House price data are only available for some countries'namely, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, [Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay'and even when available, time series are usually short, with coverage often limited to large metropolitan areas or segments within them. The information on the stock and flows of housing, as well as on construction activity is also patchy. Complete information on housing-specific financial soundness indicators and household balance-sheet data is only readily available and complete for just a few countries. Notwithstanding these serious data shortcomings, in our latest** **[report**,** we find evidence that mortgage credit may be growing well above rates explained by economic fundamentals over the past three years in a few economies in the region. In [Brazil, mortgage credit has surged, although this may also be explained by the introduction of a government housing credit program ('_Minha Casa, Minha Vida_'\u009d) aimed at low-income households. Certainly, the rapid expansion of mortgage credit in some countries warrants **careful monitoring**. [ **At the same time, other indicators suggest that housing vulnerabilities in the region are currently contained.** Nonperforming mortgage loans are still relatively low and mortgages are a small share of banks' funding structure. Similarly, the few existing household indebtedness indicators are at manageable levels, although they are rising, especially for low-income households. #### Closing data gaps on housing activity **Experience suggests that** **no matter how small mortgage markets are, they can have systemic effects**.** **That is, vulnerabilities arising in these markets can have economy wide implications that once materialized are often difficult to address and solve. What have we learned from the U.S. housing situation? **Problems in a small market (the subprime sector) can become systemic quickly, especially in new markets with significant data gaps. ** For these reasons, **action is needed to close information gaps and strengthen oversight of the housing sector.** Disseminating current information on housing-specific financial soundness indicators and household balance sheet data should help. But deeper reforms (such as improving credit registries, providing programs to increase consumer financial literacy, and using loan-to-value and debt-to- income limits) are necessary to ensure that the growth of the housing market is sustainable.

The [debate on austerity vs. growth has gained in intensity, as countries in Europe and elsewhere struggle with low growth, high debt, and rising unemployment. In essence, policymakers are being asked to tackle a continuation of the worst crisis since the [Great Depression. This would be no easy task under any circumstances. But it is made considerably harder by the fact that a number of countries need to engage in fiscal consolidation simultaneously. Complicating the picture further is the fact that [monetary policy in most advanced economies is approaching the limits of what it technically can do to stimulate activity, while global growth remains [weak. There is no getting around the need to reduce debt levels. High debt leaves countries exposed to interest rate shocks, limits their capacity to respond to future shocks, and reduces long-term growth potential. At the same time, we all know that fiscal consolidation'reducing deficits by cutting spending or raising revenues'can and usually does stifle growth. With more than 200 million people [out of work worldwide, and with growth in advanced countries forecast at a mere 1\u00c2? percent for 2012, getting the pace of consolidation right is therefore of paramount importance. So how do policymakers strike the right balance? As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde [pointed out the other day, the growth vs. austerity debate is essentially a [false one. There can be no lasting growth without sustainable policies, and right now that sustainability requires fiscal consolidation. But equally there can be no sustainable adjustment without growth. So **the critical challenge is to devise a strategy that is good for stability and good for growth**. This is possible. But there is no denying that, in the short term, consolidation involves real costs and requires tough choices, the more so given that growth is already below potential and there is little scope for additional lift from monetary policy or external demand. **Growth is essential** Let us also not forget that in the past, growth has played the key role in reducing debt-to-GDP ratios. **Policies aimed at enhancing growth should therefore be at the forefront of our thinking** and should play their part: with inflationary pressures low or declining in most advanced economies, [monetary policy should remain clearly supportive of economic activity, banks need to recapitalize so deleveraging stops being a brake on growth, and structural reforms need to be accelerated to boost medium-term growth. Ultimately** it is growth that will make the difference between successful and failed consolidation**. Concerted action at the regional and global level can help. **Striking the right balance** Right now, practically every country within the [European Union, plus many advanced economies in other parts of the world, need fiscal consolidation. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has reached a peak seen only once before during the past 130 years'during the Second World War. So in most advanced countries debt must come down and for that so must deficits. A key practical question is, [how fast? The general principle to answer this question is that adjustment should be conducted in the context of well-specified medium-term plans, at a steady underlying pace that balances the need to bring down deficits against that of not undermining the recovery. \"Underlying pace\" is worth stressing. It means that the adjustment path should be defined irrespective of cyclical fluctuations in output. Within that overall approach, there is scope for significant country by country differentiation: for countries where fiscal accounts are weaker, adjustment should occur more rapidly. Frontloaded and fast adjustment should be limited to countries where financing constraints leave no other option. **Are we on the right course?** From this perspective, adjustment is proceeding reasonably in all advanced economies this year. The current rate of deficit reduction in advanced economies, about 1 percent of GDP annually on average, seems about right. For 2013, the degree of planned adjustment in most countries is also largely appropriate. A notable exception is the United States, where fiscal tightening will be excessive if current legislation is not amended'hence the talk of a 'fiscal cliff.'\u009d Also, in a few euro area countries, the nominal fiscal targets for 2013 agreed before the current slowdown in growth may prove too pro- cyclical and may need to be adjusted or at least expressed in structural terms. But all should be prepared for a possible need to recalibrate. If conditions worsen, countries should stick with their announced measures, but not necessarily with their nominal targets. That means not fighting the automatic stabilizers, the reduction in revenue and increase in spending that comes about solely because of lower growth. If the [outlook turns out much worse, policies might need to be recalibrated to be more supportive of growth. Of course, [fiscal policy is not really suited as a tool to fine tune responses to small shocks, and changes in fiscal policies involve costs to credibility. But the underlying pace of adjustment may need to be reconsidered if headwinds from simultaneous public and private deleveraging prove substantially larger than anticipated or if there are further large adverse shocks. **Sustaining the effort** Even under optimistic assumptions, it will take many years for debt ratios to return to more appropriate levels. Clear medium-term plans based on specific measures and backed by strong fiscal frameworks are key to establish credibility. Vagueness about adjustment plans would have a damaging impact on any country's credibility, particularly in this environment. In that respect, it's worth noting that both the [United States and [Japan lack sufficiently detailed and ambitious medium-term plans to reduce their debt ratios. And while countries in Europe all have broad plans in place under the \"[fiscal compact\", in some cases the measures needed to accomplish the targets still need to be spelled out. In this connection it is also important to pay attention to the composition of the adjustment effort between spending and revenue measures. Here the starting point matters. In general it suggests European countries should focus more on spending cuts, which tend to be more sustainable in the longer term; while relatively low levels of spending in the U.S. suggest more room to act on the revenue side. **Looking ahead** Since the start of the consolidation phase of the crisis two years ago, the IMF advice has been in line with the general principles mentioned at the outset. We have called for more or less fiscal adjustment depending on whether we felt fiscal adjustment was proceeding with insufficient vigor or excessive zeal given the growth outlook and financing conditions. Looking ahead, we will continue to work with our member countries and help them come up with a policy mix that is right for their particular circumstances, while trying to ensure that the sum of country policies do not derail the fragile global recovery that's currently underway. This is not a good time, if ever there is one, to be dogmatic in our response to challenges. Rather we need to keep an open mind and be ready to adapt our policy responses if conditions warrant it.

The debt crisis deepened and financial markets became embroiled in turmoil, driven by fears of widespread restructuring of public debt. The crisis has harmed growth, increased [unemployment, and left a large number of people less protected. **We are now seeing some signs of stabilization**. Most countries are reducing their deficits and even if debt ratios are still rising, the **return back to fiscal health has begun**. The [International Monetary Fund and the Swedish Ministry of Finance are hosting an [international conference in Stockholm on May 7-8, with the purpose of sharing knowledge and providing guidance on the [best way to achieve fiscal consolidation, and on the role that effective fiscal policy frameworks and institutions can play in this endeavor. **Learning from experience** Sweden provides an interesting case study for countries' current predicament. In the early 1990s, [Sweden was rocked by an economic crisis with escalating unemployment, double digit deficits, and a sudden loss of market confidence that raised the cost of sovereign borrowing. In response, Sweden initiated a comprehensive set of reforms. Favorable external conditions helped, but domestic policies played a critical role in the adjustment. Strong fiscal tightening was implemented to regain fiscal sustainability and market confidence. This was accompanied by the effective handling of the crisis in the financial sector, and structural reforms that raised Sweden's competitiveness, long-term growth rates, and real wages. A new fiscal policy framework'founded on a surplus target, a medium-term expenditure ceiling and a comprehensive top-down budget process'has since helped preserve strong public finances and prepared Sweden well for the current crisis. The experience of other countries'both those staring into the headlights of a crisis and those more gradually realigning their economies to a sustainable position'can also provide valuable lessons for those now struggling with large debt, persistent deficits, sluggish economic growth, and a lack of market confidence. While recognizing that the current crisis is unique in its scope and scale, three broad lessons can be learned. **Developing a medium-term plan** First, a **comprehensive and clear plan for restoring the health of public finances** needs to be developed and adopted at the outset, although consolidation measures can be spread over time depending on country circumstances (countries that are feeling more pressure from financial markets would have to frontload the adjustment; others would have more time). Countries that have succeeded in bringing down public debt from high levels, such as Canada during the 1990s, followed this approach. It is particularly important to be clear in areas where policy decisions are hard. In the current circumstances, fiscal credibility can be significantly enhanced by clarifying how the severe long-term challenges from rising [aging- related (pensions and health care) spending will be addressed. IMF staff project this spending to increase by an average of 4 percentage points of GDP in advanced countries over the next two decades. This trend cannot be ignored. At the same time, fiscal adjustment should be done in a way that protects the poor and most vulnerable, and shares the burden across the population. If painful fiscal reforms are not perceived as fair, they never gain the support of citizens. **Having a strong institutional framework matters** Second, **well-designed fiscal institutions can support the implementation of fiscal plans**. The importance of strong budgetary institutions'the set of rules and procedures defining the preparation, approval and execution of the budget'cannot be underestimated. Here too a medium-term orientation is important, particularly when it comes to public spending. In countries like the Netherlands and Finland, fiscal policy has been driven for years by well-designed medium-term expenditure frameworks. Of course, introducing fiscal frameworks on paper is not enough. An equally important aspect is transparency, which allows plans to be scrutinized and ensures that governments can be held accountable for their implementation. In this area, Australia and New Zealand have been leading with their codified transparency requirements. Independent fiscal councils can also play a role. **Reforms to support growth** Third, **fiscal adjustment should go hand-in-hand with structural reforms** that lay the foundation for sustained productivity and employment growth. Growth will alleviate the daunting challenges of fiscal consolidation, and the task is to find ways of encouraging it without undermining the fiscal position. Reforms in product and labor markets'several countries in Europe are stepping up their efforts in this area'may not yield immediate results, but will over time boost economic growth and lighten the burden of fiscal adjustment. IMF calculations suggest that increasing annual productivity growth by just a quarter of a percentage point could generate a virtuous circle leading to a decline in the public debt ratio of six percentage points within 10 years. The way forward will be difficult. The fiscal challenges are daunting. It is easy to feel discouraged. But experience shows that rapid improvements are possible. There is a way forward, but it requires immediate and resolute action on numerous fronts. The Stockholm [conference is a small but important contribution to these efforts.

To the person on the street, what matters is how this growth translates into jobs and wages. The news on the jobs front, unfortunately, remains grim. Five years after the onset of the Great Recession, 16 million more people are likely to remain unemployed this year than in 2007. This estimate is for a set of countries for which the IMF forecasts unemployment rates; adding in some countries for which the [International Labour Organization provides forecasts only boosts the number. The bulk of this increase in unemployed people has been in the so-called advanced economies (the IMF's term for countries with high per capita incomes), as shown in the chart below.

Domestic uncertainty over the countries' future course, compounded by the global slowdown and rising oil prices, took a toll on growth in 2011, and the current year will be equally challenging. A joint and sustained effort is needed to help these countries navigate through this challenging period and set out an economic vision that is fair and inclusive. **Clear risks require strong resolve** The difficulties and challenges facing these countries were very much a focus of discussion during the recent 2012 [IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington. The meetings brought together ministers and top officials from all over the world, with Middle East issues high on the agenda. There was broad consensus at the Spring Meetings that a strong strategy is needed for the countries to overcome these mounting challenges. * First,** the immediate challenge that many Arab countries in transition now face is to address fiscal and balance of payments imbalances** without crowding out private investment. This requires controlling wasteful and untargeted spending, especially on subsidies. But subsidy reform is not easy and it is crucial that adequate social protection is put in place while subsidies are being phased out. In some cases, addressing the balance of payments imbalances will also require allowing for more exchange rate flexibility. And it will be crucial to mobilize external support. * Second,** countries need to define their policy plans that aim at bringing about a job-creating growth that benefits all segments of the society.** A piecemeal approach will not suffice to meet this challenge. Reform agendas need to go to the heart of the economic problems of the past that have also fed into the uprisings. This includes ensuring equal access to economic opportunities, promoting transparency, improving access to credit, enhancing the business environment, and reforming the education system and labor market. * Third,** the reform agenda needs to be designed in the respective country and to enjoy broad political support.** Economic programs for countries in transition are most likely to be implemented by current and successor governments over 2-3 years. So, broad political support is crucial to strengthen confidence and to implement programs successfully. * Fourth,** the international community, including regional partners, has a responsibility to support Arab countries in transition** by providing the necessary financing, market access, and technical assistance to help manage the difficult period ahead. **Regional events** Along with discussions with country delegations, IMF Management also participated in regional and international forums with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Our Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, met with ministers of finance and central bank governors from the region, a good opportunity to listen to their perspectives and issues. In addition, the [Deauville Partnership Ministerial Meeting centered on the economic challenges that transition countries are currently facing. We gave our latest macroeconomic assessment on the Arab countries in transition in a[ background note to Ministers. IMF Deputy Managing Director Nemat Shafik participated in a [seminar on the political economy of subsidy reform, moderated by Al-Jazeera. The seminar focused on the experience of countries from Middle East and North Africa and elsewhere in carrying out spending reform, and particularly subsidies, which in the MENA region are both unsustainably high and inefficient. Speakers who played a key role in subsidy reform in their countries discussed how governments can address the challenges of phasing out universal price subsidies and introduce more targeted forms of social protection, and the lessons that can be drawn for the MENA region. Finally, we launched a light version of our semiannual [Regional Economic Outlook. During the event, I had the opportunity to present to the press and representatives from the region our [latest assessment of the region's economic situation and outlook and to address many questions on the Fund's engagement with ' and challenges faced by ' countries in transition. **IMF's financial contribution** We want to help the Arab countries in transition. In early April, the IMF approved a concessional loan for [Yemen, discussions are under way with [Egypt for possible financial assistance, we are providing [Libya with the needed technical assistance, and IMF staff is in early discussions on financing needs and possible support in a few other cases. We remain ready to support programs that maintain macroeconomic stability, promote inclusive growth, enjoy the necessary broad political support, and include adequate external financing from regional and international partners. We strongly believe that any reform agenda should be designed and owned by the country. The IMF can provide technical advice and the lessons of experience from across our membership, and we need to ensure that the measures in any country's economic program are likely to achieve their stated objectives. But the specific choice of measures is best decided by those who will have to implement the program.

The findings in this new [report, just released in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, illustrate how Asia's economic fate remains heavily dependent on events far beyond its immediate borders. Consider two possible future scenarios to illustrate this ongoing interconnectedness: if global prospects continue to brighten following recent, concerted policy actions in the euro area and, if there are further indications of recovery in the United States, this will all augur well for trade-dependent Asia. Against this backdrop, the region could enjoy a boost in demand, fresh capital inflows and even a revival of overheating pressures. But, were the financial turmoil in the euro area to escalate and spread globally, this would likely result in a sharp fall in demand for Asia's exports by advanced economies and a possible retrenchment of credit by stressed foreign banks, all of which would be a severe blow to Asia. Or consider the impact on the region of a geopolitical crisis which pushes energy prices sharply higher. This would create difficult trade-offs between inflationary pressures and budgetary risks from energy and food subsidies. **Global developments** Consequently, the policies of Asia's decision makers will likely be largely determined by the direction of global developments. Under the more positive scenario of ongoing improved global economic and financial conditions, and any subsequent rising threat of inflation, the region's leaders will need to consider renewed tightening and continued normalization of monetary policy in pursuit of sustainable, noninflationary growth. The fact is, the global outlook underpins any turnaround in Asia and at this point, it could go either way: too early to declare victory over the forces of financial volatility and contagion. The art then is being prepared for either eventuality and policymakers should be ready to shift gears if, and when, circumstances warrant. If the first months of 2012 are anything to go by, then the outlook is favorable. Capital inflows into emerging Asia rebounded, stock markets recovered and most local currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Inflation continued to fall, propelled mainly by the normalization of energy and food prices. But, a note of caution here, inflation expectations have increased in many countries, while macroeconomic policies remain generally accommodative in the region. **Differing by country** Beyond the immediate fight against inflationary pressures, over the medium- term many countries in Asia need to continue their pursuit of sustainable growth. How this is to be achieved will differ from country to country. China, for example, needs to continue rebalancing away from investment-led toward consumption-led growth. During the recent IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings, the Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, Yi Gang noted that you only had to stroll through the shopping malls of the country to see consumption in action. Such continued rebalancing would be good for China and good for the world. In the case of India, the country would benefit from improvements in the investment climate and raising its trade integration, whereas for ASEAN economies, public investment in infrastructure'within the framework of medium- term goals'would help attract private investment and promote more broad-based growth. The task for low-income countries in Asia is to attract foreign direct investment (including from other Asian economies), and so help these countries become part of the Asian miracle. So yes, Asia's economic fate remains heavily dependent on events outside its borders. But another argument for rebalancing (were one needed) is that it would make the region less vulnerable to external shocks. But regardless of this interdependence, Asia continues to have plenty of space and the power to determine the shape of its economies.

But spring comes in fits and starts'a day of sunshine, followed by cold rain, followed by sunshine again. So, we carry an umbrella on sunny days'but also have sunscreen ready. It's much the same for most of **Latin America and the Caribbean**, as we discuss in our [_Regional Economic Outlook for the Western Hemisphere_. So, on a spring day, how do we see things? Well, before explaining what I mean, let me start with a [**broad overview**. **Most of Latin America stands out from much of the rest of the world'not for great economic performance, but for good performance in a subpar environment**. Growth is generally solid, despite a slowdown late last year owing to policy tightening and global volatility. Under our baseline scenario, we expect regional growth to moderate to near 3\u00c2\u00be percent in 2012, down from 4\u00c2? percent last year (but modestly up from our January projections). Some countries will continue to benefit from twin tailwinds of high commodity prices and easy international financing. But others will face weak demand from advanced country partners, or homegrown fiscal problems. And for all countries short-term risks (while receding) still tilt downwards'renewed European tensions or a large oil price shock could hit financial markets and global growth, triggering safe haven flows out of emerging markets, including Latin America. [**Umbrella or sunscreen?** The region is quite diverse, so let me focus today on the **inflation targeting commodity exporters** (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay), which represent close to 60 percent of the region's total GDP. These countries have generally fared well, thanks to good economic policy management as well as favorable external conditions'the twin tailwinds. These tailwinds may persist for a while, unless large shocks appear. In fact, even modest-sized shocks would probably not disrupt capital flows into the region for too long. With this group of economies mostly near or above full capacity, **policies need to continue moving to neutral**. The stimulus rightly deployed to combat the effects of the 2008'09 financial crisis has been only partially unwound. Indeed, overheating remains a risk'credit and import growth have slowed but are still strong. In particular, continued fiscal normalization is essential'not just to avoid driving an overheating cycle and reduce the burden on monetary policy, but to preserve credibility and make space for a response if downside risks materialize again. The authorities also need to keep in mind that favorable conditions will not last forever, so it will be important to manage the abundance well.[ Meanwhile, monetary policy should remain nimble and continue to serve as a first line of defense in case of adverse global shocks. The Lehman and European crises have a common thread'the global propagation of liquidity shocks. We've seen the effects of these shocks on our shores'tightening in local markets, including shortages of dollars. While those effects have waned, policymakers need to be alert for droughts punctuating the rainfall, and stand ready to support liquidity in their markets in the short term, as needed. In these ways, policymakers can carry both an umbrella and sunscreen. Now is not the time to rest easy; nor to try to fight risks that haven't materialized yet. Instead, **rebuilding resilience and flexibility will provide the best bet for continued good economic performance**, until the skies clear for good and summer comes. Let me conclude by noting that this edition of our _Regional Economic Outlook_ features three analytical notes on: (i) how global financial shocks affect output in Latin America; (ii) the real spillovers from the region's largest economies; and (iii) developments in the housing and mortgage market in the region.

Fiscal adjustment is taking place in economies around the world, but risks remain high. Bringing debt and deficits down to more moderate levels is important to easing risks. From one perspective, the sooner this happens, the better. But, slashing budgets too abruptly can impede the overall economic recovery. And if the recovery stalls, debt and deficits will rise, and so will unemployment. According to [our analysis, **what is needed is a steady but gradual adjustment.** So, as we've been saying at the IMF for a while now, the pace of adjustment needs to be appropriate'**not too fast, not too slow, but just right, for countries where financing conditions allow.** **Improving picture** Compared to six months ago, there has been some decline in risks. This is primarily because of progress in policy implementation, with progress being made particularly in Europe. **However, the risks remain very high, as underscored by continued market volatility, and by the fact that public debt is still on the rise.** The chart below shows the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the last 130 years, on average, for the advanced economies._ _It shows advanced economies currently at a very high level' reached only once in the last 130 years, at the time of the Second World War. So, the risks are still elevated in advanced economies. As the [Fiscal Monitor underscores, the outlook is better in emerging economies, although they are still exposed to spillovers from advanced economies. [ **Altogether, fiscal adjustment is proceeding on average this year more or less at a pace that we regard as appropriate,** taking into account the need to balance the different risks that countries are facing. In a few countries there would be room to reduce the pace of deficit reduction if the authorities wanted some extra insurance against downside risks to growth, but overall we think the pace of adjustment is broadly appropriate. **A closer look at the numbers** To get a sense of what's really happening with deficits, it can be useful to look at the structural balance. This allows one to strip out the effects on the budget of faster or slower growth, as well as of one-time factors that may temporarily make the outturn look better or worse but that will not occur in future years. The change in the structural balance gives us a sense of how the deficit improved or worsened independent of cyclical and one-off factors. In 2011, the change in the structural balance, country by country, amounted on average to 3/4 to 1 percentage points of GDP. More or less the same adjustment is taking place this year, 3/4 to 1 percent of GDP, on average. The largest adjustment is observed in countries that are subject to market pressures. But except for Japan, which is still responding to the effects of the earthquake and Tsunami, all the advanced economies are reducing structural deficits. Notably, the United States and Germany, which are not subject to market pressure, are also adjusting over 2011'12 (and by about the same amount as each other). So the adjustment is proceeding and will continue next year. **A long way to go** For some countries, a lot of progress will be made during 2012 and 2013. But for others, a lot will remain to be done in the following years to bring debt ratios down to pre-crisis levels. And even for countries that have already made substantial progress, the challenge will remain to maintain that progress for several years as debt ratios slowly come down. **What is needed in each country is a clear medium-term fiscal adjustment plan to reduce public debt over time.** Some countries already have such plans in place. Others, like the United States and Japan, still have to clarify fully their plans to reduce public debt over the medium term. They need to do so soon. In the absence of such plans, which would help anchoring expectations, even more fiscal tightening may be needed than if there was a plan for a gradual adjustment. For example, again, in the United States, in the absence of any additional measures the deficit will narrow in 2013 by about 3.5 percentage points of GDP, which will be the largest fiscal adjustment in a single year since 1947, when the deficit declined a lot because of the ending of military spending at the end of the War. The impact on growth of such a steep deficit decline in a very uncertain economic environment could be calamitous. **Pressures ease for emerging economies** Emerging economies saw considerable adjustment in 2011. The adjustment is virtually coming to an end in 2012, but we regard this as broadly appropriate, because on average the fiscal accounts of the emerging economies are not in such weak shape as those of advanced economies. But emerging economies with high deficits and high debt will also have to continue the adjustment over time. **Key policy conclusions** **First,** **fiscal adjustment must proceed at a steady pace, and one that is neither too fast nor too slow, if there is fiscal space.** * This means that if growth were to falter with respect to our current projections, countries should let the automatic stabilizers operate'like unemployment insurance or low-income tax credits. And if there is a loss of revenues because there is less growth, this loss of revenue should not be offset by further tightening measures that would make things more difficult. * In an uncertain environment countries with fiscal space can consider also slowing the pace of fiscal adjustment to minimize downside risks to growth. **Second, a clear and credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plan is a key requirement for sustainable growth.** * Fiscal institutions can help through this process. The Fiscal Compact in Europe is a significant step in this regard. * Further steps will have to be taken over the medium term in Europe toward a stronger form of fiscal federalism, better risk-sharing tools, progress on the issue of Eurobonds'these have been discussed a lot, but no decision has yet been taken. Eventually, also, there should be a stronger role for the EU budget, including addressing cyclical downturns in some regions. These are things that have to happen over the medium term. But the important element is that there is a plan and a shared consensus on what to do in these areas. * Further reforms in fiscal institutions are also needed in other parts of the world. For example, the budget process in the United States is far from perfect. Reform in spending for pensions and health care is also crucial for long-term fiscal sustainability. **The impossible made possible** Bringing down public debt to the level where it was before the crisis may now seem almost impossible. But, the task will be greatly facilitated if countries grow faster over the longer run. **We have calculated that an increase in annual long-term economic growth of just a quarter of a percentage point could set in place a virtuous circle that would lead, after ten years, to a decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 6 percentage points.** This is because higher growth makes it easier to run a primary surplus and lowers the public debt-to-GDP ratio directly. This in turn lowers the interest rate, which in turn boosts economic growth. If this virtuous circle between growth and reduction of public debt is activated, what many regard now as an almost impossible task, lowering public debt to where it was before the crisis, will look considerably easier.

At the national level, stronger policies are being put in place in Italy and Spain; a new agreement has been reached on Greece; and Ireland and Portugal are making good progress in implementing their respective programs. Importantly, the European Central Bank's decisive actions have supported bank liquidity and eased funding strains, while banks are reinforcing their capital positions under the guidance of the European Banking Authority. Finally, steps have been taken to enhance economic governance, promote fiscal discipline, and buttress the 'firewall'\u009d at the euro area level. These actions and policies have brought** **much-needed relief to financial markets since the peak of the crisis late last year. **But it is too soon to say that we have exited the crisis, because lasting stability is not yet ensured. **Indeed, we have been reminded in recent weeks that sentiment can quickly shift and rekindle sovereign financing stress, leaving many sovereigns and banking systems caught in a vicious circle. Furthermore, pressures on European banks remain from high rollover requirements, weak growth, along with the need to strengthen balance sheets, including by shrinking. Some deleveraging is healthy'when banks increase capital, cut noncore activities, and reduce reliance on wholesale funding that results in more robust balance sheets. But like Goldilocks, the amount, pace, and location of deleveraging must be just right at the aggregate level'not too large, too fast, or too concentrated in one region or country. **** **So far current policies have prevented a generalized 'credit crunch'\u009d, but we still anticipate a considerable squeeze on credit which will impede growth. **We estimate that large European Union-based banks could shrink their combined balance sheet by as much as $2.6 trillion'or about 7 percent of their total assets'by the end of 2013, with about a quarter of that shrinkage leading to a cutback in lending. Overall, we estimate that deleveraging by EU banks could reduce the supply of credit in the euro area by about 1.7 percent over two years. However, if current policy commitments are not implemented and financial stresses intensify, the downside risk of a large-scale and synchronized deleveraging** **could** **do serious damage to asset prices, credit supply, and economic activity in Europe and beyond. In this scenario, we estimate that large EU banks could shed a total of $3.8 trillion, or 10 percent, of their total assets by the end of 2013. Such a retrenchment by EU banks could reduce euro area credit supply by 4.4 percent; and GDP could fall by 1.4 percent from the baseline after two years. Outside the euro area, **the region most affected by the deleveraging process is emerging Europe**. And other emerging markets are unlikely to remain immune. While emerging markets generally have substantial policy buffers, such an external shock could combine with homegrown vulnerabilities and further undermine global stability. Unaddressed fiscal challenges in **the United States and Japan **represent latent risks to global stability.** **Both countries have yet to forge a much- needed political consensus for medium-term deficit reductions. The United States is also grappling with high household debt burdens and an overhang of home foreclosures. **So how can we achieve lasting financial stability? ** In the **euro area,** policy steps are needed along several dimensions**:** * **To prevent the materialization of downside risks,** continued adjustment efforts are needed at the national level, especially by countries currently under strain. Those reform efforts are being bolstered by a financing backstop that has recently been strengthened. This euro area 'firewall'\u009d should also be able to take direct stakes in banks in order to help break the adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and banks. * **To ensure an orderly process of bank deleveraging,** close macroprudential oversight by European banking authorities of bank business plans is called for. And greater efforts are needed to restructure viable banks and resolve weak banks. * **To strive for better and more balanced growth,** accommodative monetary policies need to be combined with a sufficiently gradual withdrawal of fiscal support in countries not subject to market pressures, and with structural policies to lift potential growth rates. * **To provide a vision of 'more and better Europe'\u009d, a roadmap for a more integrated economic and monetary union should be laid out and committed to. **This encompasses two key objectives: (i) a truly pan-European framework for bank supervision and resolution as well as deposit insurance; and (ii) greater ex-ante fiscal risk sharing, for example, through some central financing mechanisms. I am well aware that this will not be politically easy, nor immediately achievable. But a consensus needs to be forged now to help restore confidence. **** Beyond Europe, it is essential to start addressing now the medium-term fiscal challenges in the United States and Japan**. **This should be accompanied by stronger efforts to address US household debt and accelerate housing market reforms. Policymakers in** emerging markets **should not take stability for granted.** **Given the risks in advanced economies, policy room may need to be used to cushion external shocks and volatile capital flows. Homegrown vuln**e**rabilities, like those linked to persistently rapid credit growth, need to be addressed to increase resilience. None of these policies are easy and some are politically difficult.** **But I believe they are within reach. Let's not miss this opportunity.

Last autumn, a simmering European crisis became acute, threatening another Lehman-size event, and the end of the recovery. Strong policy measures were taken, new governments came to power in Italy and Spain, the European Union adopted a tough fiscal pact, and the European central bank injected badly needed liquidity. Things have quieted down since, but an uneasy calm remains. At any moment, it seems, things could get bad again. This shapes our forecasts. Our baseline [forecast, released by the IMF on April 17, is for low growth in advanced countries, especially in Europe. But downside risks are very much present. **Brakes hampering growth** This baseline is constructed on the assumption that another European flare-up will be avoided, but that uncertainty will linger on. It recognizes that, even in this case, there are still strong brakes to growth in advanced countries: Fiscal consolidation is needed and is proceeding, but is weighing on growth. Bank deleveraging is also needed, but is leading, especially in Europe, to tight credit. In many countries, in particular in the United States, some households are burdened with high debt, leading to lower consumption. Foreclosures are weighing on [housing prices, and on housing investment. These brakes to growth are reflected in our projections. For advanced countries as a whole, we forecast growth of 1.4 percent in 2012, and 2.0 percent in 2013. For the United States, the numbers are 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent. For the euro area, the numbers are -0.3 percent and 0.9 percent. The negative number for 2012 reflects negative growth in countries such as Italy and Spain; we forecast German and French growth to be positive, although quite low. Turning to emerging and developing economies: Our forecasts are for continued strong growth, although somewhat lower than in the past. For many countries, the immediate challenges come mainly from outside, in the form of lower exports to advanced countries, volatility of [commodity prices, and high volatility of capital flows. The forecasts reflect our belief that most emerging and developing economies will be able to handle these challenges, by using the monetary and fiscal space they still have, and by using appropriate macro prudential measures to deal with the volatility of capital flows or high domestic credit growth. Our forecasts for 2012 are for 8.2% for China, 6.9% for India, 3.0% for Brazil, roughly the same as in January, and slightly higher for Russia at 4.0%. For sub-Saharan Africa, our forecast is for continuing strong growth, at 5.4%. Putting things together, these forecasts imply a forecast for world growth of 3.5% for 2012, improving to 4.1% for 2013. This is roughly 0.2% higher than our [January forecast, but 0.5% lower than our forecast last [September. **So, what are the risks?** Geopolitical tension affecting the oil market is surely a risk. The main risk remains, however, that of another acute crisis in Europe. The building of the 'firewalls'\u009d, when it is completed, will represent major progress. By themselves, however, firewalls cannot solve the difficult fiscal, competitiveness, and growth issues that some of these countries face. Bad news on the macroeconomic or the political front still carries the risk of triggering the type of dynamics we saw last fall. On the **policy** front: Many of the policy debates center around how best to balance the adverse short-run effects of fiscal consolidation and bank deleveraging versus their favorable effects in the long run. In the case of **fiscal policy**, the issue is complicated by the pressure from markets for immediate fiscal consolidation. It is further complicated by the fact that markets appear somewhat schizophrenic, asking for fiscal consolidation, but reacting adversely when consolidation leads to lower growth. The right strategy remains the same as before: While some immediate adjustment is needed for credibility, the search should be for credible long-term commitments, by passing measures that decrease trend spending, and by putting in place fiscal rules that reduce deficits over time. Insufficient progress has been made along these lines, especially in the United States and in Japan. In the case of **bank deleveraging**, the challenge is to make sure that deleveraging does not lead to a credit crunch, either at home, or abroad. Partial public recapitalization of banks should remain on the agenda. To the extent that it would increase credit and activity, it could easily pay for itself, more so than most other fiscal measures. Turning to policies aimed at reducing risks, the focus is clearly on **Europe**. The measures taken in response to the fall crisis represent important progress. Further measures must however be taken to decrease the links between sovereigns and banks, from common deposit insurance, to common regulation and supervision. Now that the fiscal pact has been introduced, Euro countries should also explore the scope for issuing common sovereign bonds. Finally, taking one step back, perhaps the highest priority, but also the most difficult to achieve, is to durably increase growth and decrease unemployment in advanced economies, and especially in Europe. Low growth not only makes for a subdued baseline forecast, but also for a harder fiscal adjustment, and higher risks along the way. A search for structural and fiscal reforms that help in the long run, but do not depress demand in the short run should be very high on the policy agenda. Such reforms probably hold the key to a successful and durable exit from the crisis.

Erik Oppers Everyone wants at some point to stop working and enjoy retirement. In these uncertain economic times, most people worry about their pension. Now take your worries and multiply those several billion times. This is the scale of the pension problem. And the problem is likely bigger still: although living longer, healthier lives is a good thing, how do you afford retirement if you will live even longer than previously thought? This so-called **longevity risk**, as discussed in the IMF's _[Global Financial Stability Report_ has serious **implications for global financial and fiscal stability, and needs to be addressed now.** Here's the issue: governments have done their analysis of aging largely based on best guesses of population developments. These developments include further drops in fertility and some further increase in longevity. The trouble is that in the past, longevity has been consistently and substantially underestimated. We all live much longer now than had been expected 30, 20, and even just 10 years ago. So there is a good chance people will live longer than we expect now. We call this longevity risk'the risk we all live longer than anticipated. **Risky business** Why is that a risk, you may ask. We all like to live longer, healthy lives. Sure, but let's now return to those pension worries. If you retire at 65 and plan your retirement finances expecting to live another 20 years (assuming you have enough savings for at least that period), you would face a serious personal financial crisis if you actually live to 95, or' well in your 100s. You could rely on your social security system at that point, but the program is also counting on people not living much beyond their mid-80s in most countries. Your personal financial problem multiplies by the size of the population, and, for society as a whole, becomes a very large problem. Our [analysis presents some back-of-the-envelope estimates that indicate that this longevity risk, when aggregated over all individuals, could make the global cost of aging'already recognized to be very large'some 50 percent larger still if people live just three years longer than currently expected. These extra costs could have large negative effects on already weakened private and public sector balance sheets, making them more vulnerable to other shocks and potentially affecting financial stability. And since most individuals and their pension plans do not adequately account for longevity risk, a large part of those additional costs of aging could fall on governments, as people who run out of retirement funds will likely rely on public programs designed to combat old-age poverty, such as social security schemes. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the economic crisis many governments do not have the fiscal room to absorb these extra costs. **Admit you have a problem** So what does [the report recommend? A first important step is governments, pension funds and other providers of retirement income, and individuals should recognize they run this risk and prepare for its financial impact. Second, the risk should be shared among government and the corporate sector. One effective way to share the risk with individuals is to have them to work longer. A third way to deal with longevity risk is to transfer it to those that can best bear its financial consequences. For example, pension funds in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have transferred their longevity risk to insurers for a fee. You might think governments' current fiscal worries eclipse aging and longevity risk; issues that are likely to start really biting only decades from now. **But I argue we do need to fix the problem now for at least two reasons**: * First, as with all retirement-related issues, the earlier they are dealt with, the easier the solutions are. We were all told to start planning and saving for retirement in our 20s. Those who waited to get serious until they were in their 40s and 50s know how difficult it is to catch up. Similarly, governments cannot wait until the problem is 'in its 50s,'\u009d so to speak. * Second, financial markets look forward and will'sooner or later'realize the potential effects of longevity risk on government finances. If these effects are left to languish without solutions and perceived to threaten fiscal sustainability, markets can respond long before longevity risk actually materializes'witness recent parallels in government debt markets in countries facing threats to fiscal sustainability. So it turns out, unfortunately, that the financial and fiscal problems associated with longevity may be a lot bigger than we thought. The good news is that if we act now, we can find solutions that limit hardship and disruption. The flip side is that if we delay action, the ultimate medicine will be a lot harder to swallow.

Why Pension Reforms Are Needed in Emerging Economies", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4794", "content": " [By [Mauricio Soto We're all getting older, and there's no doubt that [pension reform is a hot topic in the advanced economies. **But it's also critical in emerging economies**. Our analysis here at the IMF shows that across emerging economies pension spending is projected to rise as the population ages. On average, these spending increases are not that large. But **reforms are needed** to increase coverage of the system without making pension systems financially unsustainable over the long term. **Rising spending** In emerging Europe, we've seen how pension spending has increased from 7\u00c2? to 9 percent of GDP over the past two decades. Spending also increased rapidly in other emerging economies'albeit from much lower levels'going from 2 to 3 percent of GDP over the same period. It seems the relatively low spending in emerging economies outside Europe reflects relatively low coverage (generally only those in the formal sector are eligible) and younger populations. **Populations are aging rapidly in the emerging economies.** As illustrated in Chart 1, a rather grim picture is developing where we see that the ratio of elderly to working population will more than double in the next four decades. **In the future, there will be many more retirees consuming what fewer workers will produce.** **[** ** ** So taking this into account, Chart 2 shows the projected increase in pension spending over the next 20 years is about 1 percentage point of GDP. And these projections assume no expansion of coverage beyond current levels. [ Several countries'Bulgaria, Chile, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland'have enacted reforms that will cut public pension spending over the next 20 years. In other countries'particularly in Asia, we see smaller projected spending increases due to lower coverage and spending. **For five emerging market economies the fiscal burden will be a lot higher (more than 2 percentage points of GDP).** ** ****Not everyone gets a pension** ** **In many emerging economies a large share of the elderly population is poor'in part because of inadequate pension coverage. **Region** | **Percentage of the elderly who receive public pensions****** ---|--- **Emerging Asia** | **26%** **Latin America** | **59%** **Emerging Middle East and Africa** | **68%** **Emerging Europe** | **93%** **Expanding existing pension systems to improve coverage would be costly.** For example, increasing coverage from 26 to 34 percent in Asia would increase spending by 1 percentage points of GDP. Similarly, in other emerging economies outside of Europe, increasing coverage from 64 to 73 percent would increase spending by 1 percentage point of GDP. **How can pension reform help?** There is plenty countries can do to address burgeoning demographic pressures to public pension systems. The range of measures includes **raising retirement ages, cutting pension benefits, and increasing revenues.** Among these options, gradually raising retirement ages has some [clear advantages: * Promote higher employment levels and economic growth * Help avoid cuts in pensions, reducing the impact of reforms on elder poverty * May be easier for the public to understand than cutting pensions or increasing contributions. One possible strategy would be to equalize retirement ages of men and women'in many emerging economies the statutory retirement ages of women remain lower than those of men. **For the emerging economies with** **low pension coverage**, current systems'which are often generous but cover only a small portion of the population'should be reformed prior to expanding coverage. In addition, countries with very low coverage rates could consider 'social pensions'\u009d that provide a noncontributory flat pension aimed at poverty reduction. **For countries that have** **substantial pension coverage**, such as in Emerging Europe, continued reforms are needed to contain the growth in public pension spending. . They also need to be cautious in diverting additional contributions from public to private systems, which could make the financing of the deficit more challenging in the [short run. **Many emerging economies will need to expand their pension systems to reduce poverty among the elderly. Well-designed reforms can help countries meet this objective without going broke. ** ", "index": 525}, {"pub": "3/29/2012", "title": "Debt Hangover:  Nonperforming Loans in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Emerging Economies", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4774", "content": " By [Christoph Rosenberg and [Christoph Klingen Some hangovers take more than a good night's sleep to get over. It's been three years since the global economic crisis put an abrupt end to emerging Europe's credit boom, but neither lenders nor borrowers are in much of a party mood. One key reason: many of the loans so readily dished out before the crisis have now gone sour. **Festering bad loans are a problem on many front**s: banks, credit supply, economic growth, and people all suffer. Take Japan's [lost decade. There too, a credit boom ended in tears, new lending subsequently went from too much to too little, and a vicious cycle of credit squeeze, declining asset and collateral values, and economic paralysis followed. In emerging [Europe, the share of loans classified as nonperforming'many of them household mortgages'have **exploded from 3 percent before the crisis to 13 percent at the peak**. As can be seen in the chart below, levels in some parts of the Baltics and Balkans are already at par with previous financial crises elsewhere. [ **Tackling bad loans** Nobody wants this dire script to replay in [emerging Europe. Policymakers, bankers, and international financial institutions therefore got together under the [Vienna Initiative to identify ways to tackle nonperforming loans. A working group co-chaired by the IMF and World Bank just presented [a report that analyzes the problem and offers a way out. Our analysis finds evidence that nonperforming loans are indeed a serious drag on credit supply and economic growth. They drive up banks' funding costs and interest margins, and at the same time drain their profits and capital. On the credit demand side, over-extended households and businesses are reluctant to consume and invest. But can banks afford aggressive loan resolution, and would higher credit growth even be desirable in a region that just went through a massive credit bubble? The analysis provides comfort on both fronts: even if nonperforming loan resolution brought new losses to the fore, financial stability would not be undermined. And despite the credit boom, the private sector's debt-to-GDP ratio is still low in most countries, so a resumption of credit growth wouldn't be a problem. **What's holding things up?** If speedy loan resolution is in everyone's interest, why is it not proceeding faster? The working group identified two key obstacles. * First, there is a **collective action problem**. Individual banks neglect the positive side effects that accrue from resolving these loans, including on collateral values. Unless their competitors do the same, they are not keen to book additional losses at a time when they face multiple regulatory and liquidity challenges elsewhere in Europe. Rather, banks might 'extend and pretend'\u009d'roll over debt service in the hope that loans will become performing down the line. * Second, moving bad loans off banks' balance sheets, foreclosing on delinquent creditors, or seizing and selling collateral isn't exactly easy in Europe's emerging economies. Legal, judicial, tax, and regulatory systems are often poorly equipped to deal with insolvency and to facilitate efficient restructuring. The best way to overcome the deadlock is a concerted push by policymakers, bankers, financial regulators and supervisors at the country level. * Banks should step up the work-out of these loans, often with help from their more experienced Western parent institutions. **Writing down unrecoverable loans shouldn't be a taboo**. Local banking associations are well-placed to generate the momentum needed to overcome the first mover disadvantage we mentioned above. * **Policymakers have a long to-do list**, depending on each country's circumstances. This includes creating'often from scratch'regimes for insolvency and out-of-court restructuring; designing tax regimes that don't punish debt writedowns and loan-loss provisioning; and ensuring that bankruptcy courts have sufficient resources. The working group also identified some do-nots: governments should avoid heavy-handed intervention such as extended foreclosure moratoria or mandated debt writedowns. Such measures backfire by undermining the payment culture and contractual environment'a deterrent for much needed new lending. * **Financial supervisors need to step up pressure to accelerate the resolution of bad loans**. Ever-greening, overvaluation of collateral, and underreporting must not be tolerated; adequate capitalization and provisioning needs to be ensured. Regulatory obstacles, such as constraints on banks to own real estate or establish special vehicles to manage these loans need to be removed. Finally, banks' home and host country regulators should coordinate their actions closely. The [International Monetary Fund, [World Bank, the [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European Union can do their part by providing international coordination, such as under the Vienna Initiative, and technical assistance.

Perhaps it made a commitment to do so; perhaps investors are beginning to doubt its ability to repay debt. It could cut spending or raise taxes, but that is painful and unpopular. What can it do? In our [work at the IMF, we sometimes discover that governments choose to employ **accounting devices** that make the deficit smaller without actually causing any pain, and without actually improving public finances. In ideal accounting, this would not be possible. In real accounting, it sometimes is. **How the devices work** Some governments, for example, have been able_ _to reduce their reported deficits by taking over companies' pensions schemes. The government's obligation to make future pension payments has a real cost, but it doesn't count as a liability in the accounting. So when the government receives a pension scheme's assets from the company, it can treat the receipt of those assets as revenue that reduces its deficit. Many other** **governments have been able to defer spending, without significantly reducing it in the long run, by entering into public-private partnerships. Under these contracts, a private company builds and maintains an asset like a road or a hospital. In return, the government agrees to pay the company for its costs over 20 or 30 years. In a sense, the government has bought the asset on an installment plan, but government accounting seldom counts this obligation as a liability. In each of the above cases'and in others analyzed in my note, _[Accounting Devices and Fiscal Illusions_'the government's deficit is lower at first, but only at the expense of bigger future deficits. **Improving transparency** The problem with the use of accounting devices is that the pain of spending cuts and tax increases is not avoided; it's postponed and perhaps made worse. Accounting devices can also make the deficit a less accurate fiscal indicator, making it harder for citizens, journalists, think tanks, investors, rating agencies'and the government itself'to understand the true state of public finances. The use of accounting devices cannot be eliminated, but **several things can be done to reduce their use or at least bring them quickly to light**: * Governments can prepare **audited financial statements**'income statement, cash-flow statement, and balance sheet'according to international accounting standards. * Statisticians can be given the resources and independence to be both **expert and impartial**, as well as the authority to revise standards in the light of emerging problems. * A **variety of different indicators of the state of public finances** can be monitored, since a problem suppressed in one indicator is likely to show up in another. The chart below illustrates the last point and, in particular, shows the value of having two different indicators of the deficit in the United States. One is a mainly cash-based measure; the other, the net operating surplus, is more like the bottom line of a private company's income statement. One cause of the difference between the two indicators is that the cost of incurring obligations to pay future pensions to government employees shows up in the net operating surplus but not in the budget surplus. [ These proposals do create more work for government accountants and statisticians, but the problems created by accounting devices cannot be solved with the stroke of a pen. **Getting an accurate picture of government finances requires hard work**, careful checks, and a willingness on the part of analysts to look at several different measures of the deficit.

But in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, [macroprudential policy'**which seeks to contain systemic risks in the financial system**'has indeed come to be an important part of the overall policy toolkit to preserve economic stability and sustain growth. For example, a number of countries, especially emerging markets, have been relying on macroprudential policies (such as loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios, or countercyclical loan loss provisions) to rein in rapid credit growth, which'if unchecked'could destabilize the financial system and, ultimately, bring about a recession and drive up unemployment. The IMF has assumed a leadership role in [macroprudential policy analysis. Our recent [analysis examines policy options for designing effective institutional frameworks and instruments. [Macroprudential policy design is still very much a work in progress, and many [countries are learning by doing. That is one reason why in our work we underscore that there is no 'one size fits all'\u009d institutional design for macroprudential policy and that macroprudential instruments should be specific enough and based on clear rules that still allow for adjustments during the business cycle. We also assess regional approaches to implementing macroprudential policy, for example in [Latin America. **Designing effective macroprudential policies** Recently, we co-hosted with the Central Bank of Uruguay a high-level [regional conference on how macroprudential policies can help achieve financial stability. The conference gathered central bank presidents, financial supervisors, and other senior policymakers from Latin America and some advanced economies to exchange views on topics such as the proper institutional design for macroprudential policies and effective instruments. The presentations by the participants are available [here. Conference participants spoke about challenges with designing and implementing macroprudential policy frameworks. Participants agreed that financial stability is a responsibility shared by all policies. Strong macroeconomic policy frameworks, especially with flexible exchange regimes, were seen as essential to prevent the accumulation of financial imbalances that could lead to systemic risk. Many participants noted that **effective microprudential policies, including effective supervision, are also critical** to prevent excessive risk taking by individual financial institutions, which could lead to broader systemic risks. However, while acknowledging the critical role of macroprudential tools, they recognized that the full effects of such tools are still not well understood. Participants also emphasized that strong policy coordination is essential so that policies reinforce each other and do not work against each other. To ensure appropriate coordination and information sharing, many countries have established financial stability committees. Participants agreed that these committees must be tailored to the individual circumstances of each country, although there was broad support to give a key role to the central bank. **Sharing experiences** Going forward, the IMF will continue to help member countries to design macroprudential policy frameworks. Conference participants noted that the Fund was in a unique position to draw on the experiences of all its members and to assume a leadership role in research and analysis on macroprudential policies. Also, the Fund's [surveillance and [technical assistance activities were viewed as highly beneficial and close coordination between these areas seen as critical. When carefully implemented, **macroprudential policy can become a cornerstone of financial stability policy**. The dictionary of financial lingo has been given an important new entry.

If I had to summarize the **global backdrop for Latin America** in four words, I would say 'favorable, but still risky.'\u009d The global setting is favorable for two reasons: * First, some of the **recent data has come in a bit stronger than expected**, particularly figures on U.S. economic activity and employment. In the emerging markets sphere, growth remains fairly solid. Notably, China continues to put in a good performance, even though growth is easing and its exports are down somewhat. Good growth in Asia supports demand for Latin America's key commodity exports, keeping terms of trade favorable. * Second, **major countries have taken some important policy steps to underpin global growth and stability**. In Europe, the European Central Bank's Long Term Refinancing Operation has eased liquidity pressures for European banks and sovereigns and headed off a large deleveraging that would have crimped growth. Also, stronger fiscal adjustment programs and progress in resolving [Greece's stresses have supported confidence. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's lengthening into 2014 of its commitment to maintain ultra-low interest rates, along with the extension of payroll tax relief and unemployment benefits, are bolstering demand and employment. Overall, **conditions and the outlook [remain relatively favorable for the region**. Commodity prices continue to ride high, despite some recent setbacks, thanks to buoyant emerging-market demand. Accommodative monetary policies in the major countries, and ample liquidity, maintain easy financing conditions for the more creditworthy countries. Indeed, the reemergence of strong capital inflows is again putting unwelcome upward pressure on exchange rates in some financially-open countries. **A bright spot in a gloomy world** **What does all this mean for the outlook?** Based on our January [global forecast'and I should note, the spring forecasts that we have yet to release may not look all that different, but somewhat better'growth for Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to slow from 4\u00c2? percent in 2011 to close to 3\u00c2? percent this year. This 3\u00c2? percent is close to the average growth rate for the region over the past decade. On first glance, that seems disappointing, but considering that growth in the major countries is so lukewarm, it's actually a respectable showing for the region. Clearly, global uncertainties have weighed on Latin America, but most economies are nevertheless growing close to potential and operating near full capacity, as shown by record low unemployment in many economies. Demand and credit growth have moderated, but continue to expand briskly, in some countries supported by public financial institutions. **Overall,** **Latin America stands out as a relatively bright spot in a gloomy world scene**. But before the region gets too comfortable, let me be clear about **what's assumed in this outlook**. Three assumptions are key, particularly for the near-term outlook: * First, **Europe takes the remaining steps to resolve its crisis**, most importantly by strengthening the firewall around the most vulnerable countries and breaking the adverse feedback loop between sovereign and financial risks. * Second, **U.S.** **fiscal policy strikes the right balance** between medium-term stability and near-term support for activity; and * Third, **geopolitical tensions remain contained**, heading off a sharp and prolonged spike in oil prices. If any of these assumptions were proven false, the associated risks could derail the fragile global recovery and spark volatility in global financial markets. For Latin America, this could mean falling commodity prices, weaker export demand, and tightening of financial conditions'a toxic mix for growth. Let me add that an oil shock would not only squeeze global demand, but also hit the prices of metals and food, which are key exports for the region. **Policy priorities** **What should Latin American policymakers do**, faced with this outlook and risks? In our view, they should take a number of steps: * Continue to use** monetary policy as the first line of defense** against risks, but only where frameworks are credible and inflation is well anchored; * Maintain** exchange rate flexibility**, a proven shock-absorber; * Continue **rebuilding fiscal buffers** to bring public debt back to pre-Lehman levels. Premature fiscal stimulus should be avoided; change course only if extreme risk materializes; * **[Macroprudential policies** should remain part of the toolkit, but are no substitute to sound macroeconomic policies. They should be used to prevent the buildup of financial sector vulnerabilities; in the downside, they can be used to avoid funding or liquidity pressures. * **Financial supervision **should be strengthened further (including by addressing information gaps) to head off bubbles in domestic credit markets. * Finally, for countries that have appropriate fiscal and macroprudential policies, but still face excessive capital inflows**, capital flow measures** remain an option. Stepping back from these details, we should recognize that this is a unique time for the region. It has proven its resilience through two major crises, Lehman and the Euro area. Indeed, investors have rewarded countries in Latin America for their track records of good policy conduct by pouring money into their markets, pushing up exchange rates, and in some instances, risking overheating. **But while now is not a time for excessive worry, or premature policy stimulus, it is also not a time for overoptimism, or complacency**. The region is still prone to [boom-bust cycles, and sustained strong credit growth should remind us of the need to continue to guard against financial excesses. Latin America should continue to show policy leadership by managing the good times well and preparing for bad times, as I discussed above'which itself is the best way to make sure that good times last.

To get back to health, Greece needs two things. First, a lower **debt burden**. Second, improved **economic competitiveness**. The new [program addresses both. **Bringing down the debt** Some countries have been able to work down heavy public debt burdens. Those that were successful did it through sustained high growth. But in Greece's case, it had become clear that high growth'let alone sustained high growth'was not going to come soon enough. **Debt had to be restructured.** The process was long and messy. After all, bargaining between creditors and debtors is rarely a love affair. In the process, foreign creditors were often vilified in Greece as bad guys'rich banks, who could and should be willing to take a hit. But in the end, banks belong to people, many of them saving for retirement, who saw the value of their bank shares go down in value. All said, the PSI (private sector involvement) [deal'**the largest ever negotiated write-down of public debt**'has reduced the debt burden of every man, woman, and child in Greece by close to '\u00ac10,000 on average, a sizable contribution on the part of foreign savers. Greece now has to do its part'with sustained political commitment to implement the difficult but necessary set of fiscal, financial, and structural reforms that have been agreed as part of the program supported by Greece's partners in the eurozone and the IMF. It is a huge challenge, no doubt. But it is also **an opportunity-to take advantage of the economic space opened up by private and official creditors.** Will Greece seize it? **Fixing public finances** First, **it has to bring down its fiscal deficit further**. Otherwise, this will simply negate the progress which was just made on the debt. The fiscal effort which has been accomplished already is truly impressive, with the primary deficit coming down from 10 percent to less than 3 percent. The reduction and the rescheduling of debt will help cut interest payments, but this will not be enough in itself to fix the hole in the public finances. Greece is still running a primary deficit, and it will soon need to run a primary surplus. There is simply no alternative. Much spending will need to be cut. And, on the tax side, given the harsh measures that have to be taken, much of the focus of the program is on fairness, on making sure that richer people do indeed pay their fair share. **Reducing the current account deficit** Equally, or perhaps more importantly, **Greece has to reduce its current account deficit**. For two separate reasons. First, no country can run a large current account deficit and borrow from the rest of the world forever. Second, as fiscal austerity cuts into domestic demand, the only way to return to growth is to rely more on foreign demand to reduce the current account deficit. And Greece still has a very large current account deficit, at close to 10 percent of GDP, despite the depressed level of output. To reduce a current account deficit, there is no secret: the country has to become more competitive, sell more abroad, and buy less from abroad. At the moment, Greece's exports amount to only about 14 percent of the goods it produces. By how much does Greece need to improve its competitiveness? It is difficult to be sure, but an improvement in competitiveness'or a real depreciation'of about 20 percent seems to be what is required. **Strategy for improving competitiveness** **There are two ways to become more competitive**: become much more productive, or reduce wages and nonwage costs. The first way is much more appealing. But there is no magic wand. While many sectors in Greece show a large productivity gap, the reforms needed involve changes in regulation and behavior, none of them easy to achieve. The program designed with the Greek government tries hard to identify where and how progress can be made. The list is long, but implementation is hard, results uncertain and, in any case, will not come tomorrow. This leaves decreases in relative wages, at least until higher productivity can kick in. In countries with flexible exchange rates, this can be achieved through currency depreciation. In a country which is part of a common currency area, it has to be achieved by decreasing nominal wages and prices. In Greece, wages have increased faster than productivity growth for years, compounding the problem. Unit labor costs'which is a key measure of competitiveness'increased by over 35 percent during 2000-10, compared to just under 20 percent in the euro area. This has to be undone. The best way forward would have been a negotiation between social partners to reduce wages and prices, and avoid a long and painful process of adjustment. This did not happen. The program tries to accelerate the process, while protecting the most [vulnerable. The harsh reality is that the adjustment has to take place one way or the other; otherwise competitiveness will not improve, demand will not increase, the current account deficit will continue, and unemployment will remain very high. The faster it does take place, the less pain there will be. **No viable alternatives** Were there less painful alternatives? I do not believe there were, or are. For example, the notion which is sometimes floated that large infrastructure projects might boost growth, increase productivity, and improve the fiscal and current accounts, is fanciful. The problem of Greece is not primarily a problem of physical infrastructure. Projects financed by state funds would do little to impact growth in the short term, would make the fiscal deficit worse, and would only delay the inevitable adjustment. What about leaving the Eurozone? Euro exit followed by a sharp depreciation could achieve the relative wage and price decline that Greece needs, and achieve it faster. (Note: the relative price and wage decline would not be avoided; it would just happen faster). Indeed, if Greece had had its own currency to start with, this would surely have been part of the program. But Greece is part of the Eurozone. And, leaving aside the large costs of no longer belonging to the Eurozone, the dislocations from a disorderly exit'from the collapse of the monetary and financial system, to the legal fights over the proper conversion rates for contracts'would be very, very large. **Long climb** The bottom line: will the program work? Greece will have to climb a mountain at least as high as the one it has just climbed and success will hinge crucially on the government's sustained and strong implementation. In all programs, unexpected events will happen, and the program will no doubt have to be readjusted along the way. As Christine Lagarde has said, \"the risks remain exceptionally high.'\u009d All this is true. But it is also true that **the program deals squarely with the two most fundamental issues facing Greece'**not only high debt but also low competitiveness.** And it is fair, both in asking for shared sacrifices, not only within Greece, but also between Greece and its creditors. ** ", "index": 530}, {"pub": "3/15/2012", "title": "Avoiding a Lost Generation", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4685", "content": " [By [Nemat Shafik (Version in [ \u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) **Young people were innocent bystanders in the global financial crisis, but they may well end up paying the heaviest price for the policy mistakes that have led us to where we are today.** Young people will have to pay the taxes to service the debts accumulated in recent years. Moreover, the global economy is threatened by continued strains in the euro area, and unemployment is still climbing in several countries, in particular in Europe. Young people (those aged 15 to 24) are the most affected, and youth unemployment has reached record levels in a number of countries. **If the right policies are not put into place, there is a risk not only of a lost decade in terms of growth but also of a lost generation.** Consider this. In **Spain** and **Greece**, nearly half of all young people cannot find jobs. In the **Middle East**, young people account for 40 percent or more of all unemployed people in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia and nearly 60 percent in Syria and Egypt. And in the United States, which traditionally has had a strong job creation record, more than 18 percent of all young job seekers cannot find employment. **Legacy of loss** Youth unemployment has [long-term consequences for economic growth because of the loss or degradation of human capital. But it also has many other consequences, both for the individuals affected and for society as a whole. Among those consequences are * **Increased costs to the economy**: Youth unemployment results in higher unemployment insurance and other benefit payments, lost income tax revenues, and wasted productive capacity. * **Brain drain**: Youth unemployment often leads to increased emigration, which is clearly happening in Ireland and Iceland and has been a long-standing feature of many Middle Eastern countries. Many crisis-hit economies have a tradition of emigration when the economy undergoes a serious downturn. * **Higher crime rates**: Increased unemployment has been linked to higher crime rates. * **Lower lifetime earnings**: Youth unemployment leaves a 'wage scar'\u009d in the form of lower earnings that can last into middle age. The longer the period of unemployment, the bigger the effect. * **Lower life expectancy**: Unemployment more generally has been linked to lower life expectancy, a higher incidence of heart attacks later in life, and even higher rates of suicide. **Road map to jobs** The biggest contribution the IMF can make to reducing youth unemployment is helping its member countries foster macroeconomic stability and restore economic growth. It is only when the economy recovers that people will start to find jobs again. To get the world economy back to where it **creates rather than destroys jobs**, a number of steps should be taken. In **advanced economies** like the United States and Europe, there is a problem of inadequate demand. More needs to be done to energize growth and employment. Many countries in **Europe** also face obstacles to hiring young people that are of a more long-standing structural nature. As part of its policy dialogue with member countries, the IMF is recommending measures to reduce labor market segmentation, lower barriers to competition (especially in the service sector), implement growth-friendly tax reforms, and increase efforts in education and research and development. **Emerging economies** are another story. They have been growing strongly, and some'at least until recently'were even at risk of overheating. Some of these countries'mainly those running large external surpluses'could contribute to solving the global and youth unemployment problem by boosting domestic demand and purchasing more goods produced elsewhere, including in advanced economies. **Low-income countries** weathered the crisis pretty well after 2008, but in the process used a lot of their government resources. They now need to rebuild their fiscal buffers, so they can sustain employment and redirect spending toward high-priority areas such as health, education, and infrastructure, even if the global environment deteriorates. Access to credit is another important factor in job creation. That is why it is important to recapitalize banks and more broadly restore confidence, so that financial institutions can get back to the business of lending and contributing to growth. In developing economies, many banks are lending, but the loans do not reach large segments of the population, particularly young people and would-be entrepreneurs. **Call to action** For millions of young people around the world, a lot is at stake in 2012. If we do not succeed in putting the world economy back on the path to recovery, **futures will be blighted, and more dreams will be stolen.** To solve the problems of youth unemployment, restoring global growth is crucial, as are policies to support job creation and credit. None of this can be achieved without global cooperation.\u00c2\u00ad Read more at [F&amp;D magazine.

Ostry (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) The global financial crisis has reminded emerging market economies, if they needed reminding, that capital flows can be highly volatile and that crises need not be home grown. [Emerging markets have been affected in a variety of ways, not least by the sharp ups and downs in exchange rates that volatile capital flows engender. These ups and downs may be less benign in emerging markets than they might be in advanced economies for a number of reasons. * First, emerging markets may have **more fragile balance sheets**'essentially they are less well hedged against currency risk'so depreciations may engender financial distress and even bankruptcies and adverse effects on economic activity. * Second, they may be **less flexible**, so that when the [exchange rate strengthens and the traded goods sector loses competitiveness, this may have permanent effects on the economy even if the exchange rate later reverts to its initial level. These factors mean that **emerging markets are likely to care a lot about exchange rate volatility**. They also care about **macroeconomic stability** and maintaining **low **[**inflation**. This is one reason a number of them have adopted [inflation targeting frameworks in recent years to guide their monetary policy. Inflation targeting is helpful because it can anchor expectations, which may have become unhinged during earlier periods of high or even hyper-inflation. But is inflation targeting compatible with concern about the exchange rate? **Conflicting aims?** You might think there is a possible inconsistency between the two. Inflation targeting implies that your monetary policy instrument'the policy interest rate'must be adjusted whenever the path of inflation diverges from the inflation target. If inflation looks to be getting out of control but the exchange rate is already too strong, you can't be worried about the latter when you set monetary policy. Conversely, if you are in a [recession and a lot of firms are going under, you want to lower interest rates to get inflation back up to target even if this might cause more trouble for firms with unhedged dollar or euro debt. These kinds of scenarios have led some to conclude that inflation targeting is not compatible with a concern about the exchange rate since the policy interest rate will not in general be able to hit both the inflation and exchange rate targets. Can you have your cake and eat it too? It would certainly help if there were another instrument that policymakers could use'say foreign exchange (FX) market intervention (official purchases and sales of dollars for local currency). In such a case, they would have two instruments (FX intervention and the policy interest rate), and two targets (the exchange rate and the inflation rate), which would indeed make life a lot easier. Is this the case? First off, **one should look at the actions of policymakers in emerging market economies, rather than any rhetoric**. These strongly suggest emerging markets believe they can influence exchange rates through their policy actions. Interest rates and FX intervention respond systematically to periods of overly strong or overly weak exchange rates, and policymakers seem to lean against the wind when the exchange rate strays too far from levels that are consistent with medium-run fundamentals. Of course it is possible that policymakers are just spinning their wheels, and that their actions do not in the end help to smooth out the ups and downs of exchange rates. Here the evidence is more mixed, but is certainly more favorable for emerging market economies than for advanced economies (which are much more integrated in global markets and, as such, much less able to influence exchange rates when the central bank acts to buy or sell foreign currency). **Squaring the circle** In a [recent paper, I'together with my co-authors Atish Ghosh and Marcos Chamon'conclude that central banks in emerging markets do have a second instrument (FX intervention, in addition to the policy rate) that can be used to manage both inflation and exchange rates. And, more to the point, **use of this second policy instrument is likely to make central banks more, rather than less, credible**. The reason is that when the exchange rate gets too far out of line (in relation to medium-run fundamentals, and looked at from a multilateral, rather than a unilateral perspective), obstinately refusing to acknowledge the issue is not tenable. Much better to adjust both policy instruments in an effort to achieve dual targets. The idea of using more tools to address economic problems is one that has been gaining traction in the wake of the financial crisis, which has brought home that a narrow view in which all will be well as long as central banks deliver stable consumer prices simply doesn't hold water. Policymakers need to target many aspects of economic performance, and make use of a broad array of tools (including [macroprudential regulation, capital controls, etc.) to deliver macro-financial stability. To be sure, excessive policy activism has its costs (and those lessons should not be forgotten), but the crisis suggests that leaving available policy instruments on the table is not the right answer either. **Not one-way** Is FX intervention costless? Of course not, and the costs (both for the country, and for the system as a whole) need to be factored in. This is why, for example, the optimal response to a mean-reverting shock (a shock that lasts for a while, but is not permanent) never involves sustained one-way intervention in the FX market (which would be too costly), but rather initial official purchases of foreign exchange followed by sales (in the case of favorable shocks, and conversely for adverse ones), with reserves returning to their initial level in the long run. In the face of permanent shocks, of course, the central bank should simply allow the exchange rate to adjust. We also believe that, by stabilizing currency values around their multilaterally-consistent medium-run levels, making use of the FX intervention policy instrument is likely to get us closer to a globally cooperative outcome than foreswearing use of that instrument. Simply put: **two instruments are better than one in achieving two policy targets**.

Naturally, weaker world growth will affect economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean. Concretely, the Fund expects the world economy to grow by just 3\u00c2? percent in 2012, \u00c2\u00be percentage points lower than our September forecasts. In contrast, our forecast for the U.S. economy for 2012 is unchanged, as incoming data signal a stronger'but still sluggish'domestic recovery that will offset a weaker global environment. Commodity prices will be affected by ebbing global demand, with oil projected to fall about 5 percent and non-oil commodities about 14 percent. **Softer growth ** **As for Latin America and the Caribbean,**** as I foreshadowed in my **[**recent blog post****, [a weaker world economy and softer commodity prices translate into a gloomier outlook (see table).** We've marked down our growth forecasts for the region as a whole by about \u00c2? percent for this year. The overall markdown for Latin America is a bit smaller than for the globe, because much of the region's economies still enjoy good domestic momentum and stable financial systems. [Moreover, commodity prices remain well above their long-term trend, despite the recent decline, and external financing remains relatively cheap and readily available (see chart). While global uncertainties have sparked volatility in capital inflows, we have yet to observe a reversal. But to be sure, there is a lot of variation in our forecast revisions within the region. * In **South America**, which until recently was growing well above trend, less favorable external conditions are expected to crimp output growth, dampening brewing overheating pressures. * The outlook for **Mexico and Central America** is broadly the same as in October, as we've left our U.S. outlook unchanged. * Meanwhile, growth in the **Caribbean** will continue to lag, held back by weak tourism flows from advanced countries and high public debt. **Take precautions** But let me emphasize, the **outlook for the region hinges on policy action in Europe**. Policymakers there need to intensify their efforts to contain the crisis, and put an end to the rise in sovereign spreads and the cutback in bank lending that threaten the global economy in 2012. These efforts should be supported by appropriate policy actions elsewhere in the advanced and emerging world. Otherwise, as the downside scenario in the IMF's recent global outlook suggests, world growth in 2012 could be some 2 percentage points lower, dragging down commodity prices and heightening financial strains. For our region, this would mean more sluggish exports, worse terms of trade, and tighter borrowing conditions. To add this all up: how should policymakers in our region react? It's always good practice'as the expression goes'to hope for the best (or at least better times), but to prepare for the worst. More specifically, they should take action on three fronts: * **Rebuild fiscal buffers**, to maintain fiscal credibility'the euro crisis vividly illustrates the costs of losing it'and prepare for a further deterioration in global conditions. * **Be ready to ease monetary policy**, where strong institutions and low inflation would permit it. Watch financial systems closely for signs of stress. * **Maintain flexible exchange rates**'our research shows that these buffer shocks, particularly from [commodity prices.

I have just returned from **[Saudi Arabia**, where I was welcomed with exceptional warmth and hospitality. It was my first visit as the Managing Director of the IMF. It was a pleasure to be in Saudi Arabia, a country with rich heritage and culture. And a country that is seeking to chart a path that balances the drive for greater economic development and closer integration into the global economy with the strong desire to preserve the traditions and values of its people. I had the privilege of meeting **H.M. King Abdullah**, senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector. Our discussions were productive and constructive, and we traded views on current global, regional, and domestic developments. **Promising economy and dynamic population** Saudi Arabia shares many of the strengths that other countries in the Middle East and North Africa possess: vast natural resources, an advantageous geographic position, access to key markets, and a dynamic and young labor force. It was also encouraging to meet Saudi academics and business leaders, including women, with whom we had engaging discussions about the global economy and their interest in advancing the country's economy. The process of human development has advanced considerably as measured by different education and health indicators. It would also be important to continue the process of inclusion that the Kingdom has already embarked upon. This would ensure that economic development has a stronger base and that nobody is left out. Indeed, generating employment for young nationals in the private sector was a topic discussed in all our meetings. **Key player in the region and globally** [Saudi Arabia plays a vital role in the region: as the largest country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Saudi Arabia helps shape the [GCC integration process; and it also supports many other countries in the region. It also constitutes a key source of investments and remittance inflows for many South Asian and neighboring Arab countries. As one of the world's largest oil producers and the only country that has consistently maintained significant spare production capacity, Saudi Arabia has a unique position within the global oil market. The importance of this spare capacity was very clear in this last year when Saudi Arabia, and other GCC producers, sharply increased oil production to limit volatility in the oil markets despite the disruptions in Libya. With the world economy precariously poised, renewed volatility in commodity markets would hurt us all. Further increases in oil prices would slowdown the global economy and eventually lead to lower demand for oil; and thus lower prices and higher volatility. Therefore, a reasonable degree of stability is mutually beneficial for oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. But Saudi Arabia's importance extends well beyond oil markets. It plays an important role in supporting the global economy through active participation in both international financial institutions, such as the IMF, and in global economic policy discussions in the context of the G-20. And my discussions revealed the tremendous interest, both within government and the private sector, in better understanding the current difficulties in the global economy and their solution. **Hope to be back** I leave the Middle East and North Africa region with a sense of hope and resolve to return to the region again soon. I believe that with [determination, the goals of the Arab reform agenda are within reach. Putting such reforms in place will help countries in the region both meet people's aspirations and help them contribute even more to the rest of the world.

They spoke about the _Freedom and Dignity Revolution_, as the Tunisians call it, and of their concerns to ensure a smooth transition to democracy and prosperity.[ [One year on, it is still extraordinary to think how this dramatic transformation by a grassroots movement has migrated to other countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Alongside my official visits, I particularly enjoyed a lunch I had with a small group of women, entrepreneurs, professors, and youth activists who spoke passionately about their lives, their commitment, and their hopes for their country. Since I was [appointed head of the International Monetary Fund last July, I have set about visiting all major regions of the world to hear the concerns of our members and understand the issues faced by different countries. **Tunisia is the first Arab country I am visiting. I am also going to Saudi Arabia**. **Lighting the path ahead** Tunisia is going through an [inclusive process of transition, but faces some extraordinary challenges. I have heard from its leaders how Tunisia was the model that paved the way for the Arab Spring, and their firm belief that it remains capable of lighting the path forward for other countries going through historic changes in the region. I listened carefully to their leaders and to the women. One cannot but respect the determination and passion with which both leaders and people want to make this historic transformation succeed. In all revolutions, a period of unease and impatience inevitably follows the initial heady successes. The turbulent world economy has added an extra dimension of uncertainty to an already difficult year. **Youth bearing the brunt** I told [Tunisian CEOs and representatives of the banking sector that Tunisia faces deteriorating public finances, a widening current account deficit, and lingering problems in the banking sector, and there is widespread anxiety about the cost of living and trade. The upheavals of the past year have given renewed urgency to the need to [counter chronic joblessness, particularly among the young people. Unemployment in Tunisia has risen sharply from an already high base. It is now estimated at 18 percent, with youth unemployment at over 40 percent. We must remember that economic development is not an end by itself; it is only a means to enrich peoples' lives. And nothing enriches like gainful employment. It is also a source of dignity, mobility, and hope. The government and private sector must work in harmony to boost investment, productivity, and create jobs. Tunisia, unfortunately, is facing additional challenges stemming from the [looming debt crisis in the Euro zone. **Challenges in year ahead** The key challenges for the [coming year will be to ensure social cohesion while maintaining macroeconomic stability. To that end, ensuring adequate financing is a top priority. Capital markets will likely provide only a small part of these funds ' and at a higher cost. So, regional partners and the broader international community will also be called upon to provide financial support. [The IMF is ready to do its part. The road ahead will be long and demanding, but I remain hopeful. The country that is so famous for its diversity and love for freedom, will succeed in overcoming the hardships. The magnificent ceramics that shroud the buildings of the capital Tunis, the mosaics that go back hundreds of years and that have survived wars and conflicts are but a reflection of that diverse culture that must be preserved and respected. This is an image I will take with me from Tunis, together with the strength of my Tunisian women friends!

Our view, explained in a new [study, is that **the years _do_ matter**. Our analysis shows that **gradually raising retirement ages could help countries contain increases in pension spending **and boost economic growth. Further cuts in pension benefits, or raising payroll contributions, are also options countries could consider, although many countries will find many advantages in raising retirement ages. The challenge is to reform pension systems without hurting their ability to provide income security for the elderly and prevent old-age poverty. **Pension Reform and Fiscal Consolidation** Pressures from aging populations and increases in pensions'relative to wages' have pushed public spending in this area from 5 percent of GDP in 1970 to 8\u00c2? percent in 2010. Pension spending now accounts for about a fifth of government spending. Higher pension spending has helped alleviate old-age poverty in many countries, but has also put pressure on public finances. The level of pension spending a country should aim for is ultimately a question of public preference. However, since many countries need to reduce government debts and budget deficits, most big-ticket public spending categories, including pensions, will need to be part of countries' fiscal adjustment strategies. This is particularly important in countries where pension spending will continue to rise under current policies. **Outlook for Spending and Risks Ahead** Pension systems, both public and private, are designed to give people access to the benefits of future production to support their consumption during retirement. This makes **pensions vulnerable to demographics:** in the future, there will be many more retirees consuming what fewer workers will produce (Figure 1). [ From a fiscal perspective, taming public spending will not be easy in light of population aging. Pension spending is expected to rise on average by 1 percentage point of GDP, and over 2 percentage point of GDP in over 9 countries (Figure 2). [ There's also a chance that spending increases could be even higher than depicted in the chart above. Life expectancy has consistently outstripped projections'this is certainly a good thing, but it has added to the fiscal costs of pensions. In addition, some countries' official projections are based on optimistic assumptions about productivity growth compared to the recent past. Spending could also be higher than we project if there is popular resistance to implement reforms that have already enacted, once they start kicking in. **Fixing the problem** Pension reform is a politically sensitive issue and each country will need to find its own solution. As I mentioned earlier, the range of measures includes raising retirement ages, cutting pension benefits, and increasing revenues. Among these options, gradually raising retirement ages would be an attractive option for many advanced economies: * In countries where the tax burden is already high, further contribution hikes may jeopardize competitiveness and growth prospects. On the contrary, **raising the retirement age can help boost GDP** by increasing the number of years the average person spends working rather than in retirement. * Raising retirement ages would help avoid even larger cuts in benefits than those already legislated, thus reducing the impact of reforms on elderly poverty. * Gradual increases in retirement ages have already been legislated in many advanced economies. On average, these **reforms are expected to increase the retirement age by about one year over 1990'2030**. But this pales in comparison to the roughly five-year increase in life expectancy at retirement in this period. For these reasons, raising retirement ages may be easier for the public to understand than cutting pensions or increasing contributions. * Over the long run, there is no reason why increasing the number of older workers would affect employment opportunities for younger generations'just like the large increase in the number of female workers has not resulted in fewer jobs for men over the last few decades. **Raising retirement ages by another 2\u00c2? years by 2030 'about 1\u00c2? months per year' would reduce pension spending in advanced economies by an average of 1 percentage point of GDP**. Of course, this kind of reform would need to be accompanied by adequate disability pensions and social assistance programs to protect those who cannot extend their work lives. We also need to keep in mind that longevity might not be increasing as fast for lower-income groups than for the rest of the population. As I mentioned, some countries could also consider reducing pensions where these benefits are high. However, benefit cuts for those close to the poverty line should be avoided. Others could consider raising payroll contributions where these rates are relative low. To minimize the impact on low income workers, measures such as raising the caps on contributions could be considered. Let's not forget that as serious as the pension problem is, [health care spending looms as an even bigger challenge. This is why tackling both pensions and health spending should be key components of countries' fiscal adjustment plans. Advanced countries face difficult choices as they undertake fiscal adjustment. While pension reforms will certainly need to be part of the picture, we must keep in mind the vital role pensions play in reducing old-age poverty. Pension issues are no less important in emerging economies, and will be the topic of a future blog.

Doing either too little or too much both involve risks: not enough fiscal adjustment could lead to a loss of market confidence and a fiscal crisis, potentially killing growth; but too much adjustment will hurt growth directly.** At times over the last couple of years we called on countries to step up the pace of adjustment when we thought they were moving too slowly. **Instead, in the current environment, I worry that some might be going too fast.** _**Risk to recovery**_ The latest update of the [_Fiscal Monitor_ shows that fiscal adjustment is proceeding pretty quickly in the advanced economies'on average the deficit is projected to fall by a total of 2 percentage points of GDP in 2011-12. The decline is even larger in the euro area'about 3 percentage points of GDP. In a reasonably good growth environment this pace of adjustment would be fine. **But in the [current weaker macroeconomic environment bringing deficits down this quickly could pose a risk for the economic recovery.** **Some might argue that adjusting is like taking a bitter medicine, and that it's always best to get it over with as quickly as possible.** Aggressive fiscal adjustment will surely be rewarded by markets through lower interest rates, and any cost to growth is simply the price paid to ensure that fiscal credibility is won or maintained. **_Fiscal austerity &amp; market behavior_** **But [market behavior is much more complex than this, at least in the current crisis.** For sure, markets don't like large debt and fiscal deficits, but they also don't like low growth. Take the recent downgrades of several European countries. Were they purely the result of fiscal problems? No. Look at the words used by [Standard and Poor's: '_a reform process based on a pillar of fiscal austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating, as domestic demand falls in line with consumers' rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes, eroding national tax revenues.'\u009d_ Some of our analytical work at the IMF makes this point clearly. **It shows that lower debt ratios and deficits lead to lower interest rates on government bonds, but so too does faster short-term growth. So, when countries tighten fiscal policy and the economy slows, [some of the gains from better fiscal fundamentals will be lost through lower growth.** We also see some evidence of a nonlinear relationship between growth and sovereign bond spreads: spreads are more likely to increase when growth is already lower and the fiscal tightening is larger (see chart). If growth falls enough as a result of a fiscal tightening, interest rates could actually rise as the deficit falls. [ **_Country-specific fiscal policy_** **So how should fiscal policy respond if growth slows more than expected?** **For some advanced economies, limited access to financing leaves them no option but to stick to their deficit reduction plans this year.** But fiscal tightening cannot be the _only_ tool to restore market confidence. Structural reforms to boost competitiveness and growth are also critical, but even reforms started today will take time to yield results. So it will be critical to support countries that are adjusting at an appropriate pace by making adequate financing available to them'in the euro area, through the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism'to provide a boost to confidence while market perceptions adjust. Markets eventually respond to improved economic fundamentals like stronger medium-term growth and lower future deficits, but on occasion this takes a while. **There are many other advanced economies, however, where fiscal policy has more freedom.** **If growth slows, these countries should avoid further fiscal tightening.** They should allow the impact of an economic downturn on revenues and spending on things like unemployment benefits to raise the deficit temporarily. **Among those countries with more flexibility, there are some'including in the euro area'where very low interest rates or other factors are creating adequate fiscal space to allow them to reconsider the pace of deficit reduction this year.** Take for example the United States. Based on current policies, the deficit would decline by over two percentage points of GDP in 2012, the largest single year adjustment in four decades. That's too much. Renewing the payroll tax cut and extending unemployment compensation for the long-term unemployed'two measures set to expire this year'would provide welcome support to the economy. Actions like these would be greatly facilitated by the adoption of credible medium-term adjustment plans, which are still missing in some key economies.** ** **_The bottom line_** Government debt remains very high in many advanced economies, and fiscal adjustment to bring debt down over the medium term is essential. **Nearly all advanced economies plan to reduce their deficits this year. But if growth slows more than expected, some may feel inclined to preserve their short-term plans through additional tightening, even if hurts growth more.

Markets remain very volatile and long-term foreign investors have sharply reduced their exposure to a number of euro area debt markets, including some in the core. Keeping these investors involved is essential to stabilizing markets. Moreover, **deleveraging by European banks may ignite an adverse feedback loop to euro area economies and beyond**, even if acute pressures have been mitigated by recent extraordinary ECB measures. Like cholesterol, deleveraging can be good and bad. European banks have had excessive levels of leverage and had expanded into a number of non-core areas. So, increasing bank capital levels, shedding bad loans, and withdrawing from non-core businesses should be encouraged. But there is also the danger that deleveraging could be too fast, overly concentrated in some areas, and could cut off credit at the expense of the economy. ** **All these risks could spill over well beyond the euro area. Emerging European economies would be most affected, reflecting the substantial presence of euro area banks in these countries. Nor is the United States immune to spillover risks, given the close trans-Atlantic financial and trade connections. A large shock from the euro area could be magnified by existing weaknesses, notably in the still-fragile U.S. housing sector. **Policy Priorities** Policymakers need to press ahead and bolster plans to restore financial stability in the euro area and beyond. Urgent policy action is needed: **_ _****_First, in the euro area, the 'firewall'\u009d needs to be sufficiently large and convincingly built _**to avoid abnormally high funding costs for sovereigns and banks. To do this, it will be important to strengthen, and advance work on, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible. Action by the ECB to provide the necessary liquidity support to stabilize bank funding and sovereign debt markets will also be essential. At the international level, the IMF aims to raise up to $500 billion in additional lending resources to create a **global firewall**. This would further help not only restore confidence in the euro area, but also address potential spillovers. **_Second, a _**[**_macroprudential_****_ gatekeeper is needed to assure bank deleveraging plans are consistent with sustaining the flow of credit to support economic activity_** and to avoid a downward spiral in asset prices. The potentially harmful effects of deleveraging should be addressed at both the national and international levels. Within the European Union, such a role should be coordinated among European banking authorities. **_Third,_** **_a credible increase in bank capital buffers remains necessary to restore market confidence. _**Banks should increase their capital levels, not just capital ratios, in line with the recent European Banking Authority (EBA) recommendations. For those solvent and otherwise viable banks that cannot raise sufficient private capital, public funds should be made available, based on strict conditionality. To complement this support and limit the additional burden on some sovereigns, **a ****pan-euro-area facility should have the capacity to take direct stakes in banks**. **_ _****_Fourth, adjustment remains essential, but the short-term impact on growth should be taken into account._** The solvency of sovereigns must be assured. Governments have to implement credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies within a solid euro area framework. Over the longer term, initiatives to strengthen fiscal and financial union will be crucial to restoring market confidence. Elsewhere, the **United States and Japan** need to address their fiscal challenges, and the United States must solve the problems of the housing market and mortgage debt overhang. **_ _****_Fifth, policymakers in emerging markets should stand ready to counter funding and credit strains, and to deploy countercyclical policies where headroom is available. _**Emerging markets in many cases have built ample cushions of reserves that could be used to counter external liquidity shocks The global financial system remains fragile. It is urgent to restore confidence in the euro area and beyond. Otherwise we run the risk of a deepening of the crisis, with far-reaching global economic and social consequences. Fortunately**, it is not too late to put in place the right policies that take us out of the danger zone**. But for this, we need good politics and the collective determination to reach now a cooperative solution both within Europe and at the global level.

There is an even greater danger, namely that the European crisis intensifies. In this case, the world could be plunged into another recession. **_Turning to the good news-_w****ith the right set of measures, the worst can definitely be avoided, and the recovery can be put back on track. These measures can be taken, need to be taken, and need to be taken urgently. ** **_And now the numbers, starting at the epicenter: _** **The IMF's forecast for growth in Euro Area for 2012 is '0.5 percent**'this marks a decrease of 1.6 percentage points relative to our September 2011 projection. In particular, we predict negative growth in Italy ('2.2 percent) and Spain ('1.7 percent). **We have also revised downwards our forecasts for other advanced countries, although by less.** Only for the United States, is our forecast unchanged at 1.8 percent. **The growth outlook in emerging and developing countries is also down**, at 5.4 percent, a decrease of 0.7 percent relative to our September forecast. The revision is particularly sharp in Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting their links to the Euro area. But it is also substantial in China and India, where internal factors explain most of the decrease. **_What are the forces behind these numbers? _** **Most advanced economies are operating with two major brakes on. ** * **The first is **[**fiscal consolidation****.** Consolidation is necessary'debt levels are very high'but, in the short run, it is clearly a drag on demand, it is a drag on growth. * **The second is **[**tight credit****.** In many countries, particularly in Europe, banks are still weak. They are deleveraging. And, in many cases, deleveraging means tighter credit to households or firms, another drag on growth. With those brakes on, the recovery cannot be very strong, and indeed this is something you see in past financial crises. **What is happening in Europe, however, is making things worse. ** **Doubts about fiscal sustainability are leading to high yields on sovereign bonds and, in turn, doubts about bank solvency.** To reassure markets, governments have felt they had to consolidate further. To reassure investors, banks have deleveraged and tightened credit. **Both actions have further decreased growth, leading to a dangerous downward spiral.** This explains our forecasts of negative growth for some of the Euro periphery countries, and low growth in the rest of the Euro area. Looking beyond Europe, spillovers through trade are already visible among Euro trade partners. And bouts of risk aversion and uncertainty are leading to high volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. **If not contained, this downward spiral can lead to even worse outcomes**, be it disorderly default or Euro exit, with major spillovers, first to the rest of the Euro area, and then to the rest of the world. **_In this context, the required policies are clear. _** These are largely a repeat of the main messages from the [Managing Director Christine Lagarde's speech yesterday. * **First, fiscal consolidation must proceed, but at an appropriate pace. Decreasing debt is a marathon, not a sprint. Going too fast will kill growth, and further derail the recovery.**It took more than two decades to successfully decrease debt from its World War II heights. We should expect that it may take as long or longer this time.Of the essence here is a credible medium term plan, something still missing in the United States and Japan. Once such a plan is in place, in most countries, automatic stabilizers should be left to play. In some countries, slower consolidation may even be appropriate. * **Second, a credit crunch must be avoided. Where banks need to increase their capital ratios, they should do it through an increase in capital, rather than a decrease in credit.** Recapitalization through public funds will help credit, sustain activity, and may actually improve the fiscal outlook. * Third, and **to the extent that they are taking the tough measures they need to take, Euro periphery countries'such as Italy or Spain'must be able to borrow at low interest rates.** As many investors have left the market and are unlikely to return soon, **public liquidity provision may be needed.** It can be provided in various ways, by the European Central Bank, by the European Union, and by the IMF. Whichever combination is used, the available funds must be large enough to maintain low interest rates and fiscal sustainability. **Our forecasts are based on the assumption that these measures will be adopted, and the Euro crisis will slowly decrease in intensity.** If they are not, one can fear the worst. If they are adopted decisively, the world economy may perform better than our forecast. One should be under no illusion however. Even then, the brakes will still be on, and unemployment will decrease only slowly. **We have a long way to go before the world economy has fully recovered. ** ", "index": 547}, {"pub": "1/19/2012", "title": "Meeting the Employment Challenge in the GCC", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4426", "content": " [By [Masood Ahmed (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) **The issue of how to create more jobs is high on the minds of policymakers everywhere.** The economies of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries'Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates'are no exception. By many measures, these economies are doing very well. Abundant oil and gas reserves are producing large budget and external surpluses, growth is up, and considerable strides have been made on social indicators. **Yet, economic activity is dominated by the oil/gas sector** and'given that many GCC countries have proven reserves of at least another 50'100 years at current rates of production'will remain so. **However, that sector creates relatively few jobs directly**'it employs less than 3 percent of the region's labor force. Diversification strategies are in place, and the non-oil sector has grown fairly rapidly over the past decade. But can it deliver enough jobs for GCC nationals? While unemployment rates differ across countries, even those with very low levels of unemployment'such as Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates'are focusing on **how to create more opportunities for nationals in the private sector.** We examined the issue of GCC unemployment in our study [_Gulf Cooperation Council Countries: Enhancing Economic Outcomes in an Uncertain Global Economy__._ In this post, I wanted to share with you a few of our findings. **Job creation is not the problem** **Over the past 10 years, the GCC created about 7 million new jobs'a significant achievement for a region with a total population of about 40 million**. But, fewer than 2 million'less than one-third'went to nationals. The sharp rise in expatriate employment took place mostly in the private sector, but also in the public sector in Kuwait and Qatar. Many of the positions filled by expatriates were low-skill and low-paying construction jobs, but a significant part also went to highly educated professionals for jobs where there was a shortage of nationals with the requisite skills. As a result, **even the creation of millions of new jobs has not been enough to reduce unemployment for GCC nationals**. In Saudi Arabia, for example, unemployment among nationals has remained above 10 percent for the past several years, with joblessness concentrated among new entrants to the labor market'that is, young people and, increasingly, university graduates. Overall job creation is set to remain high'at an estimated 6 million over the next five years. However, past labor market trends suggest that less than one- third of these jobs will go to GCC nationals. The workforce is also growing rapidly, with more than 4\u00c2? million nationals potentially entering the labor market during this period (compared to approximately 5 million employed nationals in 2010). Barring a change in labor market patterns, an additional 2 to 3 million GCC nationals could thus find themselves without employment. Continued strong'or even accelerating'economic growth is unlikely, by itself, to be the solution. If labor market dynamics remain as they are, the amount of additional growth necessary to meet employment objectives could be quite substantial. **Increasing opportunities for nationals** **The challenge is to promote the employment of nationals without imposing undue costs of doing business that would erode competitiveness and potentially reduce growth.** Saudi Arabia, for example, is already implementing new initiatives to provide added impetus to private-sector activity and job creation: partial guarantees to ease access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises; and new programs to match job seekers with employers, including through the scaling-up of placement programs and training and education schemes. Similar initiatives are under way in other countries too. To enhance the appeal of working in the private sector, governments could make public-sector employment less attractive'perhaps by scaling back the high wages that come with it or by cutting some of the supporting benefits that have made it the dominant employer of nationals in most GCC countries. **Another challenge is to help nationals become more productive** and thereby more attractive to employers. Some options include: * better aligning education and equipping prospective job-seekers with the skills demanded by the marketplace'including extending the training and placement services and other initiatives already in place in several countries; * providing incentives for nationals to acquire the skills needed for private-sector employment; * evaluating the possibility of a tax on foreign workers (for example, as an extension of plans to increase fees for work permits, as some countries are considering) in a way that minimizes distortions in the local labor market while redressing the effect of the high wage demands of nationals; * considering the time frame and scope for offering the private sector financial and other incentives to employ nationals, and * supplementing the income of nationals through a salary top-up scheme for nationals moving to the private sector, thereby facilitating initial recruitment by employers and reducing the bias on the part of workers toward seeking public-sector jobs.

That could mean more heatwaves, more droughts, higher sea levels, more violent storms'and so on. When you start to think about the potential impact of, say, droughts on the livelihood of farmers, especially in poorer countries'\u00a6 well, you get the point. **While some progress was made in the latest round of [United Nations' climate change negotiations in Durban, South Africa, we saw two major omissions.** There was little progress on either carbon pricing or, related, financing for action against climate change. And there was not enough recognition of what economics has to offer to help tackle the problems. **Pricing that carbon: Playing the long game** **At the IMF, we've been working on the fiscal, financial, and [economic challenges of climate change.** Two years ago Carlo Cottarelli wrote about [the importance of carbon pricing as the _sina que non_ (forgive the Latin) of a coherent mitigation policy. **Carbon pricing policies are easily the most effective instruments for reducing CO2 emissions'the pre-dominant greenhouse gas'and providing incentives for the clean technology investments that are ultimately needed to stabilize the global climate system. Yet over 90 percent of global CO2 emissions are still not covered by pricing schemes.** Carbon pricing would also provide a substantial new revenue source for cash- strapped governments. Pricing US CO2 emissions (currently about 5.5 billion metric tons) at $25 per ton'a level suggested as reasonable in a [recent report'could raise in just one decade about the same revenue as the entire aspirational target of the recent United States congressional deficit reduction 'super committee.' **Of course, carbon pricing is challenging to implement**, not least because consumers get hit with higher energy prices and energy intensive firms, such as steel and aluminum producers, become less competitive. And, measures to compensate those affected, especially the most vulnerable, will likely be a factor in effective implementation. **One possibility is to scale back pre-existing energy taxes that become redundant with carbon pricing.** In many advanced countries, most, if not all, of the burden of carbon pricing on electricity prices and motorists could be offset by reducing pre-existing excise taxes on electricity consumption and vehicle purchases. Yet this tax change would be far more effective at reducing emissions as, for example, higher fossil fuel prices penalize firms using carbon-intensive fuels and driving. **Another possibility is to adjust the broader fiscal system.** In Australia, revenues from planned carbon pricing will be used to substantially increase personal income tax thresholds'in effect, people can earn more before jumping up to the first tax bracket. A further option to deal with lost competitiveness is for carbon-taxing countries to levy fees on imports from non-carbon-taxing countries: so-called border tax adjustments. These adjustments penalize countries that do not price emissions, though they need to be carefully designed, especially to be consistent with international trade obligations. **Climate change finance: Show me the money!** Advanced country governments have also committed to raising $100 billion a year for climate adaptation and mitigation projects in developing countries, but it is far from clear where this money might come from. Earlier this year, the [Group of Twenty advanced and emerging economies asked the IMF, along with others, to evaluate the options. **[Many domestic revenue sources are up for debate** (like taxes on electricity, fuels, income, capital, and even financial transactions). But carbon pricing seems the best bet'it raises this revenue and tackles the climate problem directly. Realistically though, it is difficult to imagine, in the current fiscal environment, governments parting with much revenue from any of these domestic sources. **[Carbon charging for international aviation and maritime fuels might be more promising,** given that national governments don't yet have a clear claim on this tax base. (There are all sorts of legal issues with international aviation'but I'm no lawyer, so let me focus on the economics.) There are clear environmental grounds for such fuel charges: about 3 percent of global CO2 emissions result from flying or shipping, and currently there are no excise taxes analogous to those for motor fuels. There are also broader fiscal grounds for the charges. For example, international passenger tickets are generally not subject to value added taxes. **Charges should be coordinated internationally, and developing countries may need compensation to entice their participation in these charging regimes.** Here, there are some promising options: they could keep the revenues they collect from aviation fuel charges or receive rebates for maritime charges in proportion to trade shares. **Insuring against catastrophe ** Not to get too gloomy on you, but **maybe we also need to start thinking about developing 'last resort' technologies** like filters for sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, techniques for deflecting incoming sunlight, and the like. This could come in very handy in the very unlikely event that future warming imperils the planet as we know it. These possible technologies raise all sorts of tough issues. **But the longer policy omissions delay real progress on emissions pricing, the very small possibility of such a catastrophe creeps up just that little bit more.** ", "index": 550}, {"pub": "1/5/2012", "title": "Trade Winds\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Has the Spectre of Protectionism Blown Away?", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4368", "content": " [By [Tamim Bayoumi The global crisis has pushed trade reforms off'or at least to the edge of'the political radar screen. But shying away from improving the trade system in these tough economic times seems a little like cutting off your nose to spite your face. The IMF's First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton summed the issue up in a [recent speech: '**_trade wars can put millions of jobs in jeopardy, while trade integration can be an engine of growth_**.'\u009d **Rising pressures** As the crisis has become protracted and unemployment remains stubbornly high in many economies, there are worrying signs that protectionist pressures may be on the [rise. There are plenty of examples: recent actions by Brazil at the World Trade Organization (WTO) aim to use trade remedies to offset currency misalignments, China imposed duties on cars made in the United States, and legislation is pending in the United States to use trade measures to defend against 'undervalued'\u009d currencies such as the renminbi. **But now is certainly _not_ the moment we should be putting jobs and growth to the test.** **Fortunately fears of a widespread resurgence of 1930's-style trade protectionism after the 2008 financial crisis proved unfounded.** This was thanks, in large part, to a shared responsibility by countries and institutions for the multilateral trading system. Yet, our analysis reveals that **advanced economies experiencing the largest increases in unemployment were also those most inclined to impose trade restrictions**'as suggested by the number of cases of anti-dumping and countervailing duties initiated against China. In fact, we saw a big uptick in these measures in recent years (see chart). **Macroeconomic barometer** The Fund may not be the main player on the trade 'block', but we certainly take an interest given its macroeconomic importance. In fact, prospects for the global recovery and impending risks to the multilateral trading system were foremost in our minds when, together with the World Bank and WTO, we held a [trade conference'the first such event'in December 2011. Fund staff presented two papers at the conference. **[_Changing Patterns of Global Trade_ examined the growing role of vertical integration through global supply chains.** It highlights the importance of value-added analysis (as opposed to gross exports) in examining trade inter-linkages and implications for the response of trade flows to exchange rate changes. [_Protectionist Responses to the Crisis: Damage Observed in Product-Level Trade_ found evidence that, **while there was no widespread protectionist action and only a limited generalized impact on trade, protectionist measures did have a strong impact on trade in the particular products to which they were applied**. This brings me back to David Lipton's point'now is the time to resist protectionist pressures and re-energize the process of trade integration. Trade should be able to contribute to, and not detract from, a global recovery. **Which way the wind blows** On this score, reaching agreement on the Doha Development Agenda'the broad deal launched in November 2001 to facilitate development through trade'remains important, and we need to explore fresh approaches to conclude it. **But the multilateral trade agenda needs to go beyond Doha and focus on new emerging issues**, such as open regionalism and food and energy security. Without multilateral attention, these issues risk giving rise to unilateral 'trade remedies'\u009d and deals among smaller groups. **Encouragingly, trade integration is regaining strength through bilateral and regional initiatives.** * In October 2011, the United States ratified three bilateral free trade agreements with Columbia, Panama, and South Korea. * In November, nine Asia-Pacific countries embraced a groundbreaking regional trade liberalization deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Japan's commitment to join the TPP talks is particularly important, marking a potentially historic milestone in opening up sensitive sectors. And, with the world's third largest economy, the TPP would be the largest free trade zone, representing close to 40 percent of the world economy. **What's in the wind?** And, in the spirit of moving forward the discussion, and indeed the policies in support of, trade integration, **the IMF has three main lines of work in the pipeline**. * In light of recent deleveraging by European banks, **we launched in December an ad-hoc trade finance survey, in collaboration with the [International Chamber of Commerce**. The results will help us monitor risks to global trade credit and provide timely input into ongoing discussions by the Group of Twenty advanced and emerging market economies. * Global supply chains will be an ongoing area of work, **looking more in depth at value-added trade flows and the implications for trade interconnectedness and exchange rate assessments**. * Last, but not least, **we are also developing a new index of protectionist pressure**. The goal will be to summarize the key macroeconomic variables'such as growth rates, unemployment, imports, and exchange rate regimes'that help foreshadow protectionism. The index would be amenable to regular updates in line with revisions to the IMF's global projections, and could thus serve as the Fund's own gauge on trade winds.

Growth has softened in the larger countries of the region. Looking North, the United States is growing a bit [more, but elsewhere activity is softening, including in China'an increasingly important customer for the region's commodities. Perhaps more importantly, global financial markets are still strained, because many questions about advanced economies remain unanswered: * The future course of the European crisis remains the biggest risk. Progress so far toward a comprehensive solution has not yet calmed financial markets. * The United States has yet to strike the right fiscal policy balance, with both near-term support for growth and long-term sustainability. **Reasons for caution** How do we at the IMF add this up to arrive at a new outlook for the Americas in 2012? While our official forecasts won't be public for a few weeks, we can say that the outlook for the year ahead will not be better than what we thought in October, when our last forecasts were published (we publish new ones on January 24, in the _World Economic Outlook Update_; look for our blog update around then). [To be sure, we don't see a recession coming in Latin America if the European crisis remains contained, but weaker growth is clearly in the cards, not least because confidence and commodity prices have been falling. Financial risks continue to dominate the outlook. These days, all eyes are on Europe. While deteriorating conditions there have not yet spilled over to Latin America, we will not be immune if the risks move to the foreground. Euro zone banks account for one quarter of banking assets in the larger Latin American countries, on average, and many of those banks are not lending or rolling over existing lines in an effort to shore up their balance sheets. But if the simmering crisis in Europe comes to a boil, that process could speed up, especially if euro zone banks are starved for short-term dollar funds (though these banks have prudently funded their Latin American activities largely through local-currency deposits, reducing their vulnerability to a dollar funding squeeze). Fewer external credit lines available to banks could trigger a credit crunch in Latin America, coming on top of a decline in confidence and slower investment and, if the malaise spreads to Asia, falling commodity prices: a toxic mix for growth and stability. **Maintaining stability** What should countries do in the face of this risky outlook? A lot depends on their current macroeconomic situation. On the monetary policy front, some countries are already taking preemptive steps, moving to neutral or easing, because they have inflation under control and activity is ebbing. (Easing may not be an option in countries with higher inflation or heavy dollarization.) On the fiscal front, the major lesson from Europe today'and from Latin America's past'is that sound public finances are crucial. In countries where fiscal room permits, there may be come a time to spend public money to fight a downturn as was done in 2009. But that time is later, if the risks appear; not now. The European crisis shows how countries with wide fiscal deficits can suffer a sudden loss of credibility that triggers capital flight, even when public debt is at manageable levels. Meanwhile, financial systems should be under extra scrutiny for signs of stress, with a particularly watchful eye for liquidity strains. The good news is that many countries in the region are entering 2012 from a [position of strength. These countries have managed their economies and markets skillfully since the 2008 crisis. In particular, the 2008 crisis taught Latin America the importance of maintaining healthy liquidity conditions to avoid a credit crunch, which is very difficult to combat with macroeconomic policies. Moreover, for the most part, banks are sound, monetary policy frameworks are increasingly credible, international reserve coverage is adequate, and public finances are strong. The key will be to hold that position. Overall, as 2012 kicks off, our advice is to hope for good news, but prepare for the bad.

The issues appeared more tractable: how to deal with excessive housing debt in the United States, how to deal with adjustment in countries at the periphery of the Euro area, how to handle volatile capital inflows to emerging economies, and how to improve financial sector regulation. It was a long agenda, but one that appeared within reach. Yet, as the year draws to a close, the recovery in many advanced economies is at a standstill, with some investors even exploring the implications of a potential breakup of the euro zone, and the real possibility that conditions may be worse than we saw in 2008. I draw **four main lessons** from what has happened. '\u00a2 First, post the 2008-09 crisis, the world economy is pregnant with multiple equilibria'**self-fulfilling outcomes of pessimism or optimism, with major macroeconomic implications**. Multiple equilibria are not new. We have known for a long time about self- fulfilling bank runs; this is why deposit insurance was created. Self- fulfilling attacks against pegged exchange rates are the stuff of textbooks. And we learned early on in the crisis that wholesale funding could have the same effects, and that runs could affect banks and non-banks alike. This is what led central banks to provide liquidity to a much larger set of financial institutions. What has become clearer this year is that liquidity problems, and associated runs, can also affect governments. Like banks, government liabilities are much more liquid than their assets'largely future tax receipts. If investors believe they are solvent, they can borrow at a riskless rate; if investors start having doubts, and require a higher rate, the high rate may well lead to default. The higher the level of debt, the smaller the distance between solvency and default, and the smaller the distance between the interest rate associated with solvency and the interest rate associated with default. Italy is the current poster child, but we should be under no illusion: in the post- crisis environment of high government debt and worried investors, many governments are exposed. Without adequate liquidity provision to ensure that interest rates remain reasonable, the danger is there. '\u00a2 Second, **incomplete or partial policy measures can make things worse**. We saw how perceptions often got worse after high-level meetings promised a solution, but delivered only half of one. Or when plans announced with fanfare turned out to be insufficient or hit practical obstacles. The reason, I believe, is that these meetings and plans revealed the limits of policy, typically because of disagreements across countries. Before the fact, investors could not be certain, but put some probability on the ability of players to deliver. The high-profile attempts made it clear that delivery simply could not be fully achieved, at least not then. Clearly, the proverb, 'Better to have tried and failed, than not to have tried at all,'\u009d does not always apply. '\u00a2 Third, **financial investors are schizophrenic about fiscal consolidation and growth. ** They react positively to news of fiscal consolidation, but then react negatively later, when consolidation leads to lower growth'which it often does. Some preliminary estimates that the IMF is working on suggest that it does not take large multipliers for the joint effects of fiscal consolidation and the implied lower growth to lead in the end to an increase, not a decrease, in risk spreads on government bonds. To the extent that governments feel they have to respond to markets, they may be induced to consolidate too fast, even from the narrow point of view of debt sustainability. I should be clear here. Substantial fiscal consolidation is needed, and debt levels must decrease. But it should be, in the words of Angela Merkel, a marathon rather than a sprint. It will take more than two decades to return to prudent levels of debt. There is a proverb that actually applies here too: 'slow and steady wins the race.'\u009d '\u00a2 Fourth, **perception molds reality**. Right or wrong, conceptual frames change with events. And once they have changed, there is no going back. For example, nothing much happened in Italy over the summer. But, once Italy was perceived as at risk, this perception did not go away. And perceptions matter: once the 'real money'' investors have left a market, they do not come back overnight. A further example: not much happened to change the economic situation in the Euro zone in the second half of the year. But once markets and commentators started to mention the possible breakup of Euro, the perception remained and it also will not easily go away. Many financial investors are busy constructing strategies in case it happens. Put these four factors together, and **you can explain why the year ends much worse than it started**. Is all hope lost? No, but putting the recovery back on track will be harder than it was a year ago. It will take credible but realistic fiscal consolidation plans. It will take liquidity provision to avoid multiple equilibria. It will take plans that are not only announced, but implemented. And it will take much more effective collaboration among all involved. I am hopeful it will happen. The alternative is just too unattractive. _Published on [iMFdirect blog._ _Olivier Blanchard is Economic Counsellor and Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund._ ", "index": 553}, {"pub": "12/16/2011", "title": "Showcasing a More Confident Africa", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4274", "content": " [ Christine Lagarde **Africa is on the move**.

Slow growth in the advanced economies is dampening demand for their exports and affecting inflows of investment, aid, and remittances. Changes in credit conditions elsewhere influence the availability of trade finance. Volatility in commodity prices creates problems for both importers and exporters. Meanwhile, climactic and other natural disasters continue to occur at the local and regional level. For low-income countries, the **impact of these problems can be especially damaging**. A surge in food prices can undo years of poverty reduction. A collapse in the price of a key export commodity can throw many people out of work and cause tax revenues to slip, just when expenditures on public services are needed most. For the poorest countries, events elsewhere can quickly affect employment, inflation, the budget, debt, and the balance of payments. **Tailored financing** To soften the painful adjustment associated with these events, low-income countries have tended to rely on external financing from the IMF, World Bank, and other international institutions. This role of the international institutions will remain critical, and we have undertaken [reforms and innovations to make IMF financing more responsive to the needs of the LICs. (The [World Bank has also undertaken important reforms.) While the nature of our mission means that IMF financing role will remain largely 'ex post'\u009d (arranged after the event), the January 2010 reforms allow us to provide financing that is **better tailored to a country's specific needs and is delivered more promptly**. Those LICs that have built up macroeconomic buffers can use them as a sort of 'self-insurance'\u009d to soften a blow. Many did this effectively in 2008 and 2009, responding to the global recession with looser monetary and fiscal policies. These [counter-cyclical policies were possible because in the preceding several years many low-income countries had brought down inflation, improved their fiscal and debt situations, and built comfortable levels of foreign exchange reserves'thanks to careful macroeconomic management and external debt relief. **Self-insurance and official financing will remain critical** for LICs, but complementary strategies can also help. In a recent [paper (joint with World Bank staff) we explore the potential role of contingent financial instruments (CFIs) in helping governments in low-income countries deal with some types of bad events. CFIs are pre-arranged instruments that are triggered when a particular (carefully-defined) event occurs. They can take the form of insurance instruments, market hedging contracts, credit lines, and debt instruments with repayment terms adjusted depending on certain events. Because CFIs are automatic, **they can disburse quickly if an event occurs**'making public finances more predictable. This helps a government to avoid abrupt spending cuts or other difficult policy measures that might otherwise have to be taken. Use of CFIs by low-income countries overall has been limited (although [the use of commodity hedging by public entities has recently been increasing). However, the international financial institutions can play a useful role in facilitating their increased development and use. **Managing risks** The core priority is to help LICs to build strong frameworks for measuring and managing the risks they face, along with operational and practical advice on how to best manage assets and liabilities (such as public debt management) in light of these risks. The IMF and World Bank already provide specialized assistance in these areas. International partners are in several cases already helping to design and facilitate the use of CFIs in low-income countries. In Ethiopia, a drought index known as _Livelihoods, Early Assessment, and Protection ([LEAP)_ is linked to donor contingency funding to provide timely delivery of cash to distressed households in the event of severe drought. With support from the World Bank and the UK's [DFID, Malawi has purchased weather derivative contracts to help protect itself from severe drought. Malawi also uses hedging contracts for maize; by carefully specify the terms for physical settlement, these customized contracts protect not only against import price volatility but also such factors as transportation constraints and the performance of local traders'enhancing the country's food security. **Ways to ramp up help** International financial institutions could ramp up their assistance in a number of ways. These could include supporting the design and implementation of risk pooling arrangements, serving as intermediaries for market hedging transactions, and helping to design and coordinate issuance of contingent debt instruments.

Almost one year ago, countries in the Middle East region embarked upon a historical transformation. Today, the state of play remains uncertain, with the setbacks and intensity of disruptions larger than expected. Here, I am thinking especially of the deplorable loss of life in places like Libya, Syria, and Yemen. **And we are now moving into the most difficult, risky, and uncertain period of all**. As I mentioned in a [speech today hosted by the [Safadi Foundation at the [Wilson Center in Washington D.C., we are in the middle of a delicate transition between 'rejecting the past'\u009d and 'defining the future.'\u009d It is a period when hard choices must be made, when post-revolutionary euphoria must give some way to practical concerns. It also does not help that this is happening at a time of great turmoil in the global economy. But I remain hopeful. The final destination is clear: the Arab Spring is still poised to unleash the potential of the Arab people. **It will be important to manage this difficult transition in an orderly way**. And here, I want to pay tribute especially to the people of Tunisia, who are going through a smooth and inclusive process of transition. Just as Tunisia provided the first spark of the Arab Spring, so now can it light the path forward for other countries in the region. **Economic challenges ** We all learned some important lessons from the Arab Spring. While the top-line economic numbers'on growth, for example'often looked good, too many people were being left out. And, [speaking for the IMF, while we certainly warned about the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in the region, we did not fully anticipate the consequences of unequal access to opportunities. Let me be frank: we were not paying enough attention to how the fruits of economic growth were being shared. It is now much clearer that more equal societies are associated with greater economic stability and more sustained growth. While each country in the region must find its own path to change, the over- arching economic goals of the Arab Spring remain clear'higher growth, growth that creates more jobs, and growth that is shared equitably among all strands of society. To that end, let me emphasize a very important point: macroeconomic and financial stability remain absolutely essential, core building blocks of any new society. Without this secure foundation, any efforts to respond to people's aspirations can simply not be realized. **Working in harmony ** To date, governments have responded to social pressures by increasing subsidies, wages, and other spending, to help lessen the hardship faced by ordinary people. This was needed for social cohesion in the short term. But it does not [come without cost. Fiscal deficits have widened, which raises concerns about sustainability. It pushes up interest rates, which makes it harder for the private sector to get credit to set up or expand businesses and start hiring people. So across the region, governments need to move towards better and sustainable fiscal policies. In particular, more targeted social protection systems would help free up funds for spending on areas like infrastructure, education, and health while laying the foundations for inclusive growth. This would be a break from the past when generalized subsidies were used to appease the population while allowing the privileged to benefit from unfair practices. So, macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth can'and indeed must'go hand in hand. What is more, the government and the private sector must work in harmony. The private sector, including small and medium-sized enterprises, must take on a leading role, to boost investment, productivity, competitiveness'and create jobs. **Enabling environment ** But for this to happen, **the government must provide an enabling environment**. It should put in place modern and transparent institutions to encourage accountability and good governance and ensure fair and transparent rules of the game. The government must also lay the foundations of a modern and competitive economy by breaking down the vested interests and cozy networks of privilege that prevent the region from reaching its true economic potential. There is simply no other way to create the 50-70 million jobs needed for the people joining the labor force and to reduce unemployment over the next decade. Of course, the region's destiny lies with itself, but the international community also has a responsibility to help. It must listen to the hopeful voices and provide support'including financing, technical assistance, and market access. **The IMF too stands ready to help**. We are working closely with our members in the region, and we are willing to walk the path with them. We are offering the best policy advice possible. We will provide financial help if requested. And with our [technical assistance, we are helping countries build better institutions for a better world. Some examples: We are helping Egypt make its tax system more equitable. We are helping Libya develop a modern system of government payments. We are helping **Tunisia** improve its financial sector. And we are helping **Jordan** with fuel subsidy reform. Amidst a darkening economic outlook and waning confidence, the Arab Spring still shines as a bright light and a beacon of hope, a symbol of what can be accomplished. The region, together with its international partners, must make sure that this light is never extinguished.

In April 2011, a study published by the _Columbia Journalism Review_ titled '[Hiding the Real Africa'\u009d documented how easily Africa makes news headlines in the West when a major famine, pandemic, or violent crisis breaks. But less attention is given to positive trends and underlying successes. In many cases, despite accelerated economic growth over the past 10 years, the rise of a middle class of consumers, and a more dynamic private sector attracting indigenous entrepreneurs, the narrative about Africa has remained focused on the bad news. [**That has, fortunately, started to change. ** This week's cover story in _The Economist_, on '[Rising Africa'\u009d, is testament to that. So too is the just-released December 2011 issue of _Finance and Development_ (F&amp;D) magazine on '[Changing Africa: Rise of a Middle Class'\u009d. **Changing the narrative on Africa** The World Bank earlier published a book on African success stories, titled _[Yes Africa Can_. And the Tunis-based African Development Bank marked 50 years after independence from colonialism for many African nations with a study called _[Africa in 50 Years' Time: The Road Towards Inclusive Growth_. The study says that 'Over the past decade, despite the successive global food and financial crises, Africa has been growing at an unprecedented rate. Though it will take decades of growth to make major inroads into Africa's poverty, there is now a growing optimism about Africa's potential.'\u009d **Exploring potential** This issue of F&amp;D explores that potential, epitomized by our cover showing Kenyans Susan Oguya and Jamila Abass, co-founders of [AkiraChix, who developed a mobile phone application for farmers in rural areas. They are working in a technology hub for IT investors and tech companies. F&amp;D's lead article by Harvard professor [Calestous Juma says a growing middle class is shifting perceptions about Africa's prospects. The middle class may have comparatively little to spend by Western or Asian standards, but the traditional focus on eradicating poverty in Africa 'distracted both African authorities and international donors from serious consideration of ways to promote prosperity infrastructure development: technical education, entrepreneurship, and trade,'\u009d he says. Undeniably, much remains to be done. But cementing the economic growth in Africa is the key to helping the poorest members of society, as [IMF African Department head Antoinette Sayeh points out.

This is understandable. After all, the storm in the euro area casts a long shadow over the entire global economy. But the IMF has 187 members, and my job is to serve each and every one of them as effectively as possible. For this reason, I am making it a point to visit the different regions of the world'to discuss, to listen, to learn. **This week, I am visiting three important countries in Latin America'Brazil, Mexico, and Peru**'a trip coinciding with the transfer of leadership in the Group of 20 to Mexico. Like so many in the region, these countries have done remarkably well over the past few years. They have harvested the fruits of strong fundamentals, sound policy frameworks, and prudent macroeconomic policies and are now enjoying sustained growth with reduced vulnerabilities'an enviable sweet spot. It wasn't always like this. In the old days, a disruption on the scale of the 2008-09 global financial crisis would have triggered major upheavals. Latin America tended to be one of the most exposed and vulnerable regions. Not any longer. In fact**, the new Latin America can provide some lessons to the advanced countries**'such as saving for a rainy day, and making sure that risks in the banking system are under control. **Not immune** Of course, **Latin America is not immune to any storms that come out of Europe**. No one is. In our interconnected world, there is simply nowhere to hide. And so countries in the region should take [all necessary precautions and make all needed preparations. They should continue rebuilding buffers, including by maintaining prudent fiscal policies'this would create room for maneuver should the economic situation turn sour. But fiscal consolidation should not come at the expense of either needed social programs or productive investment in education or infrastructure. Better to explore the scope for mobilizing more revenues, where tax collections are low, or making spending more focused and efficient. For its part, the IMF stands ready to support and assist countries with sound macroeconomic management that might be affected by the global crisis as bystanders. The challenge for the region going forward is to sustain growth in a very volatile environment. **Mexico** will need to keep a keen eye on conditions in the [United States and Europe, and implement structural reforms to unleash its growth potential. A key challenge for **Brazil** will be to increase domestic savings to reach higher and sustained growth. And **Peru** would benefit from continued reforms to achieve more inclusive growth while preserving its hard-won macroeconomic stability. **Social progress** But growth alone is just the first step. **The region in general needs more socially inclusive growth**, which means efforts to build fairer societies based on shared opportunities and social justice. Historically, inequality has been the bane of Latin America. Not only did this prevent large swaths of the population from sharing in the gains of growth, but it also contributed to social and political instability'which in turn hurt economic prospects. Indeed, recent [IMF research has shown that more equal societies are associated not only with greater economic stability, but with more sustainable growth over time. So growth and social inclusion are really two sides of the same coin. We can see this playing out in real time in Latin America. One of the factors behind the region's recent economic progress is its social progress. In countries like Brazil and Peru, indicators of poverty, inequality, and human development have improved dramatically over the past decade or so. Brazil's _Bolsa Familia_ and Mexico's _Oportunidades_ programs have enjoyed particular success in breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty'so much so that they are now models for the rest of the world. **Next generation** One final point: as the global economy is transforming, **Latin America is definitely on the rise**. And the three countries I am visiting represent'each in their own way'the next generation of global economic leadership. Mexico and Brazil are now major global economic engines. **Mexico is about to take the helm of the Group of 20** and so is in a unique position to shape our collective economic destiny over the coming year. **Brazil is a one of the world's leading emerging markets**, and is deeply integrated into the global economy. It will play a central role in the global economic debate, and will be instrumental in harnessing the global cooperation needed to address the urgent challenges of the day. And **Peru is a new rising star**'surely among the new wave of leading emerging markets. I believe Latin America is now on a firm foundation, and can look ahead to lasting prosperity and stability that can lift the living standards of all. From the vantage point of the IMF, I look forward to a **new partnership** with a new Latin America. _Also published in Spanish on __[Di\u00c3\u00a1logo a Fondo, a blog__ that provides commentary and analysis on Latin America._ ", "index": 558}, {"pub": "11/16/2011", "title": "Bringing the Informal Sector into the Fold", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4209", "content": " [By [Masood Ahmed (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) **Unemployment rates in the Middle East and North Africa have remained above 10 percent over the past decade, the highest in the world**. For the young the rates are even more daunting, at a persistent 25 percent: one in four of the region's young people are without work. Many people who cannot find jobs in the formal economy are relegated to working in the informal sector, for lower wages and without the protections and opportunities that workers enjoy in the formal economy. The informal economy is large and pervasive'and, often, ignored; however, the experience of those who work in the informal sector came under the media spotlight when [Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire that fateful day in December last year, sparking the Arab Spring protests. Estimates indicate that the informal economy in the oil-importing countries of the Middle East and North Africa is substantially larger than in several Asian and Latin American countries. In Morocco, for example, the informal economy is estimated at 44 percent of officially measured GDP. In most other oil importers, it is estimated at close to one-third. **Trying to bring the informal sector into the fold has several advantages.** Not only is it unregulated and untaxed, it typically provides only low-wage and low-productivity jobs. Rigid labor market and business regulations often reinforce the barriers between the formal and informal sectors. Trying to break these down will not only spur the economy but also help promote more [inclusive growth. **Burdensome red tape, excessive taxes ** So, why do people and enterprises remain in the informal sector? A large informal economy is often the consequence of a difficult business environment'one that is characterized by burdensome red tape, excessive taxes, and weak governance. Our [analysis of the drivers of the informal economy in oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa finds that * **Labor market regulations**'especially in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, and Syria'are often more restrictive than in other regions of the world, and contribute to the high cost of employment in the formal sector. In Egypt, for example, the high cost of firing employees impedes the expansion of formal employment; firms will either operate completely in the informal sector or hire employees informally to avoid these costs. * **Weak institutions and governance** mean that access to public services'and to the benefits of operating in the formal sector-is unavailable except to a privileged, well-connected few individuals or firms. Lack of transparency and weak governance often foster corruption, creating inequality of access to opportunities, finance, and services, eroding trust in public institutions, and making the formal sector inaccessible. * **Overly restrictive product market regulations and high tax burdens** raise compliance and entry costs, so that firms have strong incentives to avoid them by operating informally. If it is too costly or if it takes too long for a firm to comply with regulations in the formal sector, this will drive firms toward the informal sector. It may be cheaper for an informal firm to pay a bribe for public services or to avoid the enforcement of regulations. **Lost opportunities** Some may ask what's wrong with having a large informal sector? While the informal sector may provide some useful services, often **both workers and the government lose out**'workers because they operate in an unregulated environment, without protection, and the government because it loses an important source of tax revenue. In addition to not having access to social benefits, they also'over time'tend to see their skills dimish, because they don't use their talents to the full and don't get the chance to acquire new ones. They face little or no prospect of career advancement. Lack of access to well-paying and productive jobs'particularly for the growing number of young labor-force entrants'translates into lost opportunities and is a source of tension, for individuals and for society as a whole. **What can policymakers do?** To improve access to economic opportunities and achieve more inclusive growth, policymakers will need to **reduce the costs and burdens of entering the formal economy.** **Changing labor regulations** can make it less expensive for employers to hire workers formally. **More straightforward rules for establishing and operating a business** will encourage entrepreneurs to start businesses on a formal basis. Enforcing the rules fairly and consistently means that firms share not only the responsibilities but also the benefits of operating formally. **Simpler tax regulations and stronger administration** will complement these reforms. At the same time, workers in the informal sector will need help in acquiring the skills demanded by the formal sector. The Arab Spring has reminded us that **growth is not enough** in itself, particularly if its gains are captured by a privileged few and not spread broadly. Indeed, the presence of a large informal sector serves as a red flag that a country's growth is not inclusive enough.

And still, in the world's largest economy'which in the past quickly and vigorously recovered from downturns'jobs and output are barely growing.** **In fact,** **output is just 1.6 percent higher than a year ago, and almost 14 million people remain unemployed.** ** True, some of this lackluster economic performance reflects global factors, particularly the uncertainty surrounding the lingering European crisis, but also temporary factors related to the Japanese earthquake. However, on the domestic front, fragile household balance sheets and stubbornly high unemployment have been major factors impeding growth. This latter development is having negative spillovers on many Central American and Caribbean countries, where remittances and tourism flows from workers in the United States are important for their economies (see our most recent [_Regional Economic Outlook for Western Hemisphere_). **Home Sweet Home: No More** **American households have been feeling the impact of the battered housing market for a while now.** Over 10 million (out of 74 million) homeowners have lost their [homes in foreclosures since the housing bubble burst and others have experienced unprecedented declines in home prices'down more than 30 percent from their peak. This has translated into a loss of over $6.5 trillion in real estate wealth since end-2006. And with the hit to wealth, and an uncertain outlook for house prices, consumers'in the past, the main engine of U.S. growth'have slowed spending considerably. **Looking for a Job? Wait in Line Please** ****U.S. consumers are also tightening their belts given the painfully high unemployment rate****'stuck at around 9 percent'as well as falling real wages and elevated uncertainty about job prospects. Median household income has declined to its lowest level in more than a decade, and the poverty rate is now at a 17-year high, crimping consumer confidence. With more than 40 percent of the unemployed, or some 5.9 million people, out of work for six months or longer, and some 8.9 million working part-time involuntarily, this is more than cyclical: structural factors might also be at play. Long-term unemployment is critical here; many unemployed workers may take longer to find jobs because their skills are no longer in demand or because they need to relocate to a different state with better job prospects; a long and slow process, especially in a paralyzed housing market. In fact, [some of our earlier work finds that the unemployment rate might be 1\u00c2\u00be percentage points higher than in past 'normal'\u009d times given skill mismatches and the housing market hurdles. **Sorry honey, no vacation for us!** **Problems in both the housing and labor markets in the United States are having negative repercussions on its **Central America and Caribbean neighbors, who are reliant on remittances and tourism from the United States. With tourism being a luxury good, rather than an essential, Americans have slashed their tourism spending considerably'spending per tourist in the Caribbean is down to levels last seen in 2004. Meanwhile, Hispanic immigrants have disproportionately suffered from the U.S. slowdown's effect on remittances. 1. [the poverty rate for Hispanics is at a 13-year high; 2. the [median home equity of Hispanics has fallen by more than 50 percent since 2005; and 3. unemployment among Hispanics is about 2\u00c2? percentage points higher than the average, since they overwhelmingly work in sectors (construction, extraction, transportation, and services) that have been hardest hit by the financial crisis. It is no surprise, therefore, that remittances to Central America fell from an average of 12\u00c2? percent of GDP in 2006 to about 10 percent in 2010. **When will it end?** **Fixing the U.S. housing and labor market has been a daunting and challenging task,** with most analysts now expecting an even more protracted recovery on both fronts, than say six months ago. Given that the weak housing market has been a persistent impediment making a speedier U.S. recovery more difficult, a new initiative aimed at encouraging mortgage refinancing (so that borrowers can take advantage of historically low mortgage rates) has recently been unveiled. **This is a step in the right direction**'given the negative impact of the weak housing market on the economy, forceful measures to expand mortgage modification and refinancing programs are urgently needed. **With expectations for a protracted U.S. recovery, more challenging days could lie ahead for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean highly reliant on remittances and tourism flows****from the United States**.** ** While U.S. labor and housing markets are expected to remain weak for some time, tourism dependent countries in the region could begin to attract more visitors by tapping other markets (for example, South America and Asia) and/or offering more competitive packages. Meanwhile, those reliant on remittances could work towards diversifying their export base away from advanced economies. While the results of these efforts will likely only materialize over the medium term, it is not too late to begin today.

This year's topic'monetary and macroprudential policies'is equally relevant. It goes to the core of central banks' mandates, and their role in achieving macroeconomic and financial stability. The financial crisis triggered a fundamental rethinking of these issues, but much research, both conceptual and empirical, remains to be done.

Clearly, such international linkages need to be taken into account when choosing an appropriate mix of monetary and macroprudential policies. Eleven other papers we have on the program each touch on a critical aspect of the intersection between monetary and macroprudential policies. Just to give you a flavor of what to expect, here are some of the questions we will be discussing: * Should monetary policy lean against credit and asset price bubbles, or should this task be delegated squarely to macroprudential policy? * What if macroprudential policy is only partially effective because it encourages regulatory arbitrage and other 'leakages'\u009d? Does this imply that monetary policy should weigh in, too? * What if the government does not have full information on the riskiness of new financial instruments? Will it be able to set macroprudential policies at the levels that will ensure lasting financial stability? * How can policymakers guard against the possibility that monetary tightening may encourage excessive risk-taking by financial institutions that find themselves in distress at higher interest rates? * How should macroprudential policies be coordinated internationally if they have cross-border repercussions?

It is a British film noir from the 1940s. Perhaps the most striking part of the movie is the shadowy cinematography, set in post-World War II Vienna. Strangely, it springs to mind lately when I have been thinking of China. _ [Many China-watchers looked on in awe in 2009 as the government's response to the global financial crisis unfolded, causing bank lending as a share of the economy to expand by close to 20 percentage points in less than a year. This, subsequently, led to a lot of **hand-wringing about the consequences of those actions and the eventual credit quality problems that China would have to confront and manage**. However, around the same time, a less visible phenomenon was also getting underway. One that, like Orson Welles' character in the movie, resided firmly in the shadows. Various types of nonbank financial intermediaries'some new, some old'were gearing up to provide a conduit through which China's high savings would be tapped to finance the corporate sector. The available data on this is terrible'the central bank's numbers on social financing are the only credible and comprehensive public source, but even that gives only a partial picture. Talking to people in China, and looking at what numbers are available, **one cannot help but have an uneasy feeling that more credit is now finding its way into the economy _outside_ of the banking system than is actually flowing through the banks.** **The means by which such 'lending'\u009d is being provided is wide-ranging and dynamically evolving.** Certainly many are aware of the high volumes of bankers' acceptances'off- balance sheet short-term credit'being used of late. Over the past couple of years, trusts and entrusted lending vehicles (China's own particular form of asset securitization) have also taken off. Then there is the world of informal lending: loan sharks charging high interest rates to those poor souls that are rationed out of regular channels of intermediation. The recent narrative from Wenzhou has certainly excited many. But the shadows stretch even beyond these tales. In the 12 months to June, over RMB 600 billion poured into China from short- term lending by nonresidents to Chinese corporations. Financial leasing companies have expanded, providing services that look a lot like credit by another name. The corporate bond market has blossomed, perhaps reaching RMB 1 trillion in new issuance for this year. There is an unknown volume of inter- corporate lending passing from one large company to another. And finally, some nonbank institutions have entrepreneurially moved into the lending space, providing loans to large corporations as a way to boost their profitability. These developments are worrying for four broad reasons. * **First, that's an awful lot of credit.** New _bank_ credit alone is likely to be over 20 percent of GDP this year. This is already a very high number. However, if a similar amount (or more) is finding its way into the economy through channels outside the regulated banking system, this would add up to a huge amount of credit stimulus. This high level of credit, in turn, is facilitating a continued upward trajectory for investment which is fast approaching 50 percent of GDP. * **Second, the regulatory oversight for these various intermediaries is likely to be nowhere near as effective and comprehensive as it is for the banks.** We have seen this in many other countries'deposits and lending migrate out of the banking system because life is just easier there without those pesky regulators asking awkward questions about how risks are being managed. It often doesn't end well. * Third, if nonbank channels of intermediation develop at a faster pace than the banking system is reformed, **the shift of resources out of the banks and into the shadows will progressively start to undermine the health and stability of the banks themselves.** * Finally, and perhaps my largest concern. **The rapidly expanding nonbank system is actively undermining China's ability to exercise macroeconomic control.** This, in large part, reflects the structure of the current system. China uses monetary tools like interest rates and reserve requirements sparingly and, instead, relies heavily on quantitative limits on bank lending to switch on and off the credit taps and manage the pace of economic growth. These bank-by-bank credit quotas create enormous incentives for intermediaries to find other ways to lend. By not actively using interest rates and price incentives to choke of the demand for loans, China is far too reliant on controlling the supply of credit. The more intermediation that takes place outside banks, the tougher it is to enforce the credit policy that is essential in guiding the trajectory of the economy. **Thankfully, China's regulators are trying to pursue the problem.** Last year they moved to require a large share of trusts to be brought back onto bank balance sheets and, more recently, the bank regulator has issued instructions to the banks to stop moving loans off their books and repackaging them into wealth management products. Despite these efforts, this risks the regulatory authorities perpetually being one step behind the financial innovators, always patching up the last hole in the system. **What is needed instead, as we have argued for some time now, is a careful reexamination of the whole monetary and financial framework.** Policies that restrain credit through administrative means are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. It is only going to get worse. This has been the experience of every other country that has tried to exercise macroeconomic control this way. China, admittedly, has held the system together exceptionally well for many years and it is never wise to bet against the government's ability to diagnose and successfully resolve problems as the economy develops and becomes more sophisticated. That does not alter the fact, though, that China is now facing a clear choice: pursue financial and monetary reform on a timetable that is driven by careful, pre-emptive, and concerted policy planning. Or, face the possibility that change will evolve in an uncoordinated and disorderly way, with innovation and disintermediation outpacing supervisory capabilities and revealing regulatory gaps along the way. At the end of _The Third Man_, Orson Welles emerges from the shadows and, unfortunately, promptly meets an untimely end at the hands of Joseph Cotten. **It would be a major setback for China, and the global economy, if the long and proven track record of spectacular Chinese growth were to be undermined by waiting too long to make progress on financial liberalization and reform.** ", "index": 562}, {"pub": "11/1/2011", "title": "Latin America\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Commodity Dependence: What if the Boom Turns to Bust?", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=4116", "content": " [By [Gustavo Adler and [Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n Sosa (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) As a commodity exporting region, Latin America has greatly benefited from the commodity price boom of the past decade. But with talk of a new global recession, what will happen to the region if the boom turns to bust? The IMF's latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Western Hemisphere_ sheds light on Latin America's reliance on commodities from a historical perspective. Our study also looks at the effect of a sharp decline in commodity prices on emerging market economies and on the policies that could shield countries from that shock. **More _dependent_ but also more _diversified_ ** The reliance on commodity exports can be looked at as a share of GDP (_commodity dependence_) as well as**_ _**relative to total exports of goods and services (_export diversification_). The first ratio tells us about the potential impact of a commodity price shock on domestic output, while the second tells us about the economy's ability to adjust to a commodity price shock. There are significant differences within the region across these two dimensions: * **_South America is as commodity dependent (or more) as four decades ago_****, **with exports of basic goods reaching about 10 percent of GDP in 2010 (see Figure 1, left panel). But this contrasts markedly with the pattern seen in Mexico and Central America'where commodity dependence has fallen sharply, reaching balanced trade in 2010. It is also very different from the trend observed in emerging Asia, which has gone from being a net commodity exporter in 1970 to a net importer in 2010. * At the same time, **_Latin America as a whole is today _****_more diversified than four decades ago_**, as noncommodity exports have grown even more rapidly than commodity exports during the past 40 years, especially in Mexico &amp; Central America (see Figure 1, right panel). But not all countries have followed this trend: heavy energy (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) and metal exporters (Chile and Peru) have witnessed both increasing dependence on and little (or no) diversification away from commodities, making them especially vulnerable to a commodity price slump. [ **Metal and energy prices are highly sensitive to global growth_ _ ** Prices of many commodities have moved closely during the last cycle, but the magnitude of their booms and their sensitivity to global output have varied across categories (see Figure 2): * **_Energy and metal prices_** have tripled since 2003, and current prices are not far from the historic peaks of the 1970s. However, these prices are highly sensitive to global output, as seen during the 2008'09 crisis and all previous recessions (the only exception being the oil shocks of the 1970s). * The surge in **_food prices_** since 2003 has been less spectacular. Prices are up about 50 percent, and they have only partly reversed the pronounced downward trend seen for several decades. At the same time, food prices are much less sensitive to world growth. [ **Policies matter** [The history of sharp terms-of-trade drops during the past 40 years tells us that these price shocks can have a sizeable impact on the region, and can be even more important than other external shocks (see Figure 3). But their magnitude cannot fully explain how countries fare during episodes of price busts. Instead, policies during the boom years play a critical role in determining a country's subsequent economic performance. Our study finds that: * Countries that behave more prudently during the boom phase of commodity price cycles'preventing a deterioration of their underlying fiscal and external positions'perform better during the bust. * Exchange rate flexibility is a powerful shock absorber, although less so in the context of highly dollarized economies. * In countries with strong fundamentals, the extent of financial integration with the rest of the world can also play an important role in buffering the shock, by helping to keep external funding available. Latin America has reaped the benefits of the commodity boom of the last decade. But preserving those gains requires undertaking the right set of policies to be prepared for a possible bust, while favorable conditions last. This is especially important in the case of metal and energy exporters, which are particularly vulnerable to a global slowdown.

As elsewhere, uncertainties over the robustness of the global recovery could cloud the region's growth outlook. Assuming, however, that these external risks do not materialize, we foresee good prospects for the region, with fairly robust growth over the coming year. We are projecting growth in both groups of countries in the range of about 5\u00c2? and 6\u00c2? percent in 2011 and 2012'as detailed in our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia_. ** ** ** **Looking beyond growth rates, however, one challenge that stands out for the region as a whole is to create jobs. **Limited data** It is difficult to determine the extent of unemployment in the region as data are sparse. What is clear, though, is that jobs are lacking throughout the region. This problem is not always evident in the official unemployment figures, which are generally low, especially in Central Asia. But these figures mask the fact that there is a lot of underemployment, particularly in rural areas. In the south Caucasus, for which more data are available, unofficial estimates point to unemployment rates ranging from 10 percent to as much as 30 percent. In all countries, youth unemployment rates are even higher'close to 15 percent in Azerbaijan, and in the range of 35'40 percent in Georgia and Armenia. In addition, in several countries in the region'especially Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic'the lack of jobs has led many to seek work in other countries, especially Russia. This is an important vulnerability, because if the Russian economy slows down, these workers will return home, adding to poverty and social problems. **Explaining unemployment** Unemployment in the south Caucasus appears to be largely structural in origin'that is, much of it won't be resolved by a short-term increase in economic activity. The boom period prior to the global financial crisis, for example, did not put much of a dent in these countries' officially recorded unemployment, nor did the crisis itself lead to a measurable increase for the most part. In contrast, however, in other countries'Tajikistan, for example'the slowdown in Russia did lead to an increase in returning migrants. The weak association between growth and unemployment observed in the south Caucasus partly reflects the low labor-intensity of growth. During the precrisis boom period, for instance, more jobs were created in financial services than in relatively labor-intensive sectors, such as agriculture. But the weak link could also reflect other structural factors, most notably a mismatch between the skills provided by national education systems and those demanded by the marketplace. Evidence for this is the tendency for unemployment rates to be highest among the educated. Moreover, more than 20 percent of firms in Armenia and 25 percent of firms in Georgia report 'lack of worker skills'\u009d as a major constraint to their business operations'fairly significant numbers. **Policy solutions** **A good starting point is to develop better labor statistics**, which would help policymakers get a firmer grip on the scale and scope of the unemployment problem and, in turn, help them formulate policies to tackle it. On a basic level, governments in the region could do more to nurture private- sector development, particularly in sectors outside of mining, oil, and gas. Countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia have made **important strides in improving the business environment**, but many still lag behind on several indicators, especially the ease of trading across borders'in such areas as the number of documents, procedures, and days needed to export and import. And the region's low scores on several widely cited governance indicators show that these governments still have work to do on eliminating corruption. All of these policies could form part of a longer-term strategy for attracting investment and creating jobs in the region. Such a plan is vital, because growth alone is not enough. **** **It is also important to focus on delivering appropriate education to fit the needs of the economy**. To that end, improving education systems to better equip young people with the skills demanded by the marketplace would help solve the skills mismatch problem, where it exists. At the same time, however, while a higher level of skills will lead to improved productivity, the question remains whether this would result in lower unemployment rates. **Should scare resources be used to provide labor-market entrants with higher education if there are insufficient high-end jobs to absorb them?** Should policymakers, instead, pursue strategies to boost investment in labor-intensive sectors, such as agriculture, to create more jobs?

Sayeh It wasn't all that long ago when virtually all of sub-Saharan Africa's exports were destined for Europe and North America. But the winds of Africa's trade have shifted over the past decade. There has been a massive reorientation towards other developing countries, in particular China and India. **Like Janus, the Roman god, Africa's trade is now, as it were, facing both east and west**. Our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook for sub-Saharan Africa_ looks closely at these developments and its policy implications. In addition to the well-known gains from international trade, Africa's trade reorientation is also beneficial because it has broadened the region's export base and linked Africa more strongly to rapidly growing parts of the global economy. These changes will help reduce the volatility of exports and improve prospects for robust economic growth in Africa. **_Transitions_****** **The reorientation of Africa's trade has been incredibly rapid**. In little more than ten years, [Africa's exports to Europe, North America, and Japan'what I will call traditional trade partners'have dropped from three-quarters to just one-half of the region's total exports. This change in trading patterns is much more dramatic than we have seen in other developing regions, including the Middle East and North Africa or Latin America. **** **China's rise as an economic force is only part of the story. **Exports to other developing countries have also increased sharply. * Today 17 percent of the region's exports are headed to China, up from negligible levels in 2000. * But other emerging markets'most notably, India and Brazil'are now the destination for 20 percent of Africa's exports, double what they were a decade ago. * There has also been striking growth of trade between countries in sub-Saharan Africa, now accounting for 14 percent of the region's total exports. **_New beginnings_** **Exports to new trade partners have thus been an increasingly important engine of growth for sub-Saharan Africa. **Exports to non-traditional partners accounted for half of the region's total export growth between 1990 and 2000, and this share rose higher still - to two-thirds - during 2005-10. This has been incredibly important given the economic malaise in the advanced economies during the global financial crisis'exports to non-traditional partners declined considerably less than exports to traditional partners.** ** **Mirroring trade flows, financial linkages with emerging partners have also strengthened significantly in recent years**. In 2008, for example, some 16 percent of all foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa was from China, compared to around 2 percent in the early 2000s. **When we look at what kinds of products are driving the re-orientation of exports, we find a nuanced picture ' and one that presents both opportunities and challenges to Africa. **Exports to the three large emerging markets (Brazil, China, and India) are dominated by natural resources, particularly oil. Indeed, by 2008, oil accounted for some 70 percent of exports to the three countries. By contrast, natural resources represent a considerably smaller share of trade with traditional partners and other developing countries, and an even smaller part of trade within the region. For example, manufactured exports account for 10 percent of intraregional exports, compared to around 5 percent of exports to Brazil, China and India. **Sub-Saharan African can thereby benefit from the shift in the sources of global growth towards emerging and developing countries. **Economic growth among these emerging new economic powerhouses has been particularly resource intensive. For Africa's commodity exporters, the demand for their resources and the corresponding upward pressure on commodity prices, has contributed to higher African income. **But, just as Janus is a two-faced god, this is not all good news**. Higher commodity prices tend to invite even more investment in natural resource output, further intensifying the region's already heavy dependence on such exports. One problem with growth that is heavily dominated by resource production is that it tends to be much less labor-intensive and with fewer direct linkages with other parts of the economy. **Pleased as I am that sub-Saharan African exporters have been quick to take advantage of the new engines of global growth, I am also mindful of the potential drawbacks**. There are three main things that policymakers in the region could do to benefit more from this new beginning: * First, countries need to** improve how they manage natural resource revenues**: good examples of this would be channeling resource revenues to high return infrastructure investments, which would help to raise productivity in agriculture and others sectors, and using these revenues to strengthen education and health care systems. * Second, **strengthening economic flexibility and safety nets** can help, particularly important where imports may displace domestic production. For example, it would be worth considering retraining programs for affected workers and facilitating access to finance for companies to shift to more competitive sectors. * Third, African countries need to **negotiate better market access in non-traditional trade partners**, which tend to have much higher trade barriers. In summary, then, **the reorientation of sub-Saharan Africa's exports towards developing countries offers the prospect of stronger and less volatile export growth.** But for the region to take full advantage of this opportunity and address the challenges it brings, African governments play a vital role and need to rise to the task, particularly through policies that support broader- based and more inclusive growth.

This week I've been traveling extensively across the region, both listening and learning. I am writing this from **Dubai**, where we have just launched our [**_Regional Economic Outlook_**. And earlier this week, I had the opportunity to participate in the GCC Ministerial Meeting in Abu Dhabi and the World Economic Forum's special meeting on [Economic Growth and Job Creation in the Arab World in Jordan. **My core takeaway from all these events is that the underlying sense of optimism in the promise of the Arab Spring is very much there, but there is also a growing recognition that managing the short-term transition will be even more difficult with the persistence of economic pressures and rising social expectations.** **Not an easy year** 2011 has not been an easy year for many countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The combination of domestic unrest and external uncertainty has resulted in a [marked downturn in economic activity, and this is expected to pick up only gradually over the coming year. At the IMF, we project growth for the region's oil-importing countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, and Tunisia) at a mere 1.9 percent in 2011, followed by a pickup to 3.1 percent in 2012. These numbers are well below the historical averages for the region and also much below the growth rate needed to keep already high unemployment from rising further. Many countries will also enter 2012 with less of a margin for maneuver, having drawn down some of their reserve cushions during 2011. On average, government deficits are widening by about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2011'12, and external reserves have dropped markedly in 2011'by nearly 40 percent in Egypt, and 5'10 percent in Jordan, Syria, and Tunisia. **Main challenge** The key challenge for the coming year, then, will be to ensure social cohesion while maintaining macroeconomic stability. To that end, ensuring adequate financing is a top priority. The external financing needs of the oil importers are estimated to exceed $50 billion in 2012. Capital markets will likely provide only a small part of these funds'and at a higher cost. So, for many of these countries, regional partners and the broader international community will also be called upon to provide financial support. The IMF is ready to do its part. As we announced earlier in the year, we could make available upon request about $35 billion to support the home-grown economic programs of the region's oil importers. Financing is only part of the answer and can only facilitate some difficult decisions that policymakers in these countries are having to make, even during this period of transition. For example, I was impressed by the proposals under discussion in Egypt to try to limit butane gas subsidies to households who really need this support; and by the many ideas that were generated at the World Economic Forum meeting on how to foster short-term job creation without incurring longer-term commitment for the public purse that would be difficult to unwind when the economic situation improves. Important as the short-term challenge is, it is only the first phase of a multi-year transformation that will make the economic systems in many of these countries more inclusive and institutions more accountable and transparent. **Oil economies benefiting from high prices** To get a full picture of the region's economic situation it is important to recognize that most of the oil-exporting countries (Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen) are continuing to show solid growth, partly because they are benefiting from the high price of oil, and partly because they have stepped up their production of oil in response to shortfalls in production from Libya. The increase in oil production is making an important contribution toward global energy market stability at a time when the world economy is facing many challenges. Our growth estimate for these economies (excluding Libya) is 4.9 percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2012. At the same time, risks cloud the outlook, in particular a possible sharp downturn in global economic activity resulting from advanced economies' difficulties in addressing their debt and fiscal challenges. If these risks materialize and global growth deteriorates sharply, oil exporters would be adversely affected, most likely through a fall in oil prices. Because of high oil prices, many oil exporters have been able to expand spending and continue to support diversification of the non-oil sector. They have increased spending to address pressing social needs'for example, to offset the impact of higher food prices or to fill gaps in such critical services as housing and health. But the flipside of higher spending has been a widening of non-oil fiscal deficits among oil exporters, making some of these countries more vulnerable to swings in oil prices. As a result, in several countries, some degree of fiscal consolidation'measures to rein in spending or increase non-oil revenue to bring down the non-oil fiscal deficit'will merit consideration in the medium term.

Thomsen ( When I traveled to **Reykjavik in October 2008** to offer the IMF's assistance, the situation there was critical. The country's three main banks'which made up almost the entire financial system'had just collapsed within a week of each other. **The sense of fear and shock were palpable'few, if any, countries had ever experienced such a catastrophic economic crash.** There was a lot of concern that a disorderly depreciation of the exchange rate would be ruinous for households and companies if nothing was done or that deposit runs would cripple what was left of the financial system. **The scale of the uncertainty was staggering**'the three banks had assets worth more than 1,000 percent of GDP, and no one knew at that point how large the losses would turn out to be and how they would be divided between Icelanders and foreigners. **Today, three years later, it is worth reflecting on how far Iceland'a country of just 320,000 people'has come since those dark days back in 2008**. Growth has returned to the economy, and new jobs are being created: unemployment, although still unacceptably high for a country used to near-full employment, has dropped below 7 percent of the work force. In June this year, the government successfully issued a $1 billion sovereign bond, marking a return to international financial markets. And while public debt, currently at around 100 percent of GDP, is much higher than before the crisis, an impressive consolidation program has put the country's finances back on a sustainable path during the past couple of years. As for the banks, they have been shrunk to about 200 percent of GDP, and are now fully recapitalized. **There are, of course, still many unresolved issues**, including the vexed Icesave case involving disputed liability for lost deposits in the U.K. and the Netherlands, but Icelanders have shown their resilience and their strength as a people. They took control of their destiny and implemented some very tough policies that are now bearing fruit. But the work is not finished, and additional efforts are needed to reduce unemployment and boost growth. **Picking up the pieces** So how did Iceland put its economy back together? The program we ended up agreeing in record-time with the Icelandic authorities had four important elements. * First, a team of lawyers was put to work to ensure that **losses in the banks were not absorbed by the public sector**. In the end, the public sector did of course have to step in and ensure the new banks had adequate capital, but it was insulated from vast private sector losses. This was a major achievement. * Second, the initial focus of the program was exclusively on **stabilizing the exchange rate**. Here, we reached for unconventional measures, notably capital controls. * Third, automatic stabilizers were allowed to operate in full during the first year of the program'effectively **delaying fiscal adjustment**. This helped support the economy at a time of severe strain. * Fourth, conditionality was streamlined and focused on the key issue at hand'**rebuilding the financial sector**. While there are some issues in the broader economy where reforms will eventually be needed, these were not a part of the program. In sum, what the [$2.1 billion IMF-supported program provided was breathing room for the authorities to figure out how to deal with the enormous challenges and tasks ahead. With loan commitments from the Nordic countries and Poland, Iceland was able to start the painstaking task of rebuilding its economy. The government quickly put its own stamp on the program. The authorities were committed to implementing the measures, but wanted to do it their way. One of the government's key objectives was to protect Iceland's social welfare state, and that goal has been accomplished.

This eclectic policy mix has been [effective in Iceland's case, but whether the lessons we have learned are applicable elsewhere, including in the crisis-stricken euro area, is far from clear. To take stock of Iceland's crisis and recovery, the IMF and the Icelandic government are co-hosting a [conference on October 27 that will see prominent economists such as Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman and international economists Willem Buiter and Simon Johnson [debate civil society, academics and IMF officials on whether the lessons learned can be applied elsewhere.

Even as Diwali celebrations begin across India, the [outlook for the world economy is fairly uneven and uncertain. More worrisome than the subdued global growth outlook, risks are building up especially in Europe'and these include an extreme scenario with financial disruption. Although India's economy has generally been less prone to external forces than many others, we still need to contend with the larger than typical risks in the global economy. These risks harken the need for a new wave of reforms. What does the more somber darker global outlook mean for India? And exactly what policies are needed? **De-linked** In our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook for Asia_, we expect India to grow by about 7\u00c2? percent in 2011 and 2012, only marginally below its estimated potential. Even within Asia, India does relatively well in this world. India is less open to international trade than most other economies in the region. In particular, its rural consumption is fairly insulated from the world economy.[ More importantly, India's exports are less dependent on advanced economies, so it suffers less from the current anemic outlook in those countries. The chart below shows that India's exports are more diversified'both geographically and in terms of the products it sells'than its neighbors and competitors. So, while a more protracted slowdown in the advanced economies will also lower India's growth somewhat, we expect that it will still remain robust. In this scenario, India has to remain focused on the challenge of elevated inflation. **Linked** But what happens to India in an extreme scenario with the contagion of further financial shocks, similar to what happened after Lehman? India has become more financially integrated with the global markets than commonly thought. We saw this in 2008, when India's financial markets came under considerable pressure and investment became the main transmission channel, dipping substantially. [To give another example, India's stock market is one of the most correlated in the region with the [VIX, a measure of market expectations of near-term stock market volatility and hence a good indicator of global risk aversion. In such a scenario with more extensive financial shocks, we expect that India would also be hit as it has a current account deficit, some of its main corporates are global players that now rely more extensively on external debt issuance, and foreign investors now also have more extensive holdings in the Indian stock market. **Time for reform** At the same time, India has the tools and the experience to deal with a repeat of 2008. But, like other emerging market countries, they likely have less policy space now, with much of it having been used as a buffer when the crisis first hit, and [inflation remaining above the Reserve Bank of India's comfort zone. While dealing with the present challenge of reigning in inflation, the need remains to rebuild the buffers to re-create policy space. In this regard, fiscal consolidation remains pivotal. Implementation of the official plans to shift the composition of budgetary expenditures away from untargeted subsidies (such as those on fuel and fertilizer) and toward infrastructure, health, and education will help in both dimensions. The strength of domestic demand was, in large part, India's saving grace when the crisis hit. And, today, domestic growth drivers still need to compensate for the external headwinds. In 1991, India's government undertook critical reforms, prompted by a balance of payments and fiscal crisis. And these reforms have continued paying off to this day. The planned budget expenditure reforms should certainly help domestic demand to be the backbone of India's ability to withstand external pressures. Also, a new wave of structural reforms can help boost investment: from introducing the GST to improving the business environment, to liberalizing the labor market, and furthering trade and financial reforms. Indeed, today's risks can be translated into tomorrow's reforms and growth momentum.

I've been in Jordan this weekend, attending a vibrant meeting of the [World Economic Forum on jobs and growth in the Middle East. I participated in a panel on employment with Queen Rania, and I'd like to share some of the ideas generated during that discussion and at the meeting more generally. The atmosphere was both cautious and optimistic'cautious because of the growing risk of the downturn in advanced economies (particularly Europe) spreading to the region, and optimistic because of the recent political gains in both Libya and Tunisia in particular. One of my biggest (and heartening) takeaways was that **there were more young people bubbling with ideas and entrepreneurial spirit (ready to take risk) than ever before** at this regional forum'which reflects a growing recognition of their current role in the Arab Spring and the role they will have to play in the future as drivers of economic change. **Creating jobs for the young and growing population in the Middle East and North Africa remains the dominant topic**. [Here on the Dead Sea, it's jobs, jobs, jobs that are still on everybody's mind. And it's clear that there's a tension between the high hopes for a better future in the long term and the impatience and frustration with difficulties and challenges in the short term. **Need for a better business climate** **Building a better climate for business and trade that will help create jobs is essential for improving growth in the region**. Governments must put employment generation at the center of policy by removing obstacles to job creation such as excessive regulation. Creating a stable economic environment in which the private sector can grow and create opportunities, particularly for youth, is vital. About a [quarter of young Arabs are unemployed, and the statistic is even higher among women. This costs the region about $ 15 billion. Burdensome regulations, exemplified by stringent labor rules, excessive labor costs'such as minimum wages that exceed productivity, and high severance pay'and high taxes tend to raise the cost of operating in the formal economy in several countries across the region, and hence drive firms to the informal sector where they can avoid such costs. Since Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire that fateful day in December last year in protest against the arbitrary confiscation of his wares, street demonstrations have highlighted the high unemployment, hikes in food prices, and unequal access to economic resources that have hampered growth in parts of the region and fostered discontent. **Making the Middle East and North Africa more business friendly is not beyond reach**. In fact, there are numerous success stories within the region itself. A number of countries have established 'Smart Villages'\u009d or 'Education Cities'\u009d where entrepreneurs find modern infrastructure and face simplified regulation and low taxation. Others have established a base in services such as tourism and call centers. In some cases, such improvements have also succeeded in attracting foreign direct investment from global companies, including those in high-tech sectors such as information technology and aeronautics. And all of these new businesses have created jobs, directly and indirectly. But more is needed to spread the benefits widely, to add training, curb corruption, and provide the right incentives. **Fairer rules** In the years leading up to the Arab Spring, there was an increasing sense that business environments were unfair, set up to benefit a privileged few. To succeed, the region's economies now need a vision not hijacked by crony interests. Public institutions have to be reformed to become effective and pro-business. Corruption has to be tamed by enforcing oversight rules to make all actors more accountable. The region also needs to focus on improving its **economic governance**. An agenda to do this should include the strengthening of public institutions, both fiscal and financial; modernizing regulatory institutions to improve the business climate and level the playing field for private sector participants; improving the delivery, coverage and cost effectiveness of social protection; and enhancing the quality and dissemination of information and statistics. Governments can create more room in budgets by making costly [subsidies more efficient. As we've argued, the best way to do this is to reduce generalized subsidies'which disproportionately benefit the better offer'and replace them with well-targeted safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. **Access to markets** Countries in the Middle East and North Africa have been trading far below their potential. One explanation is that trade policies in some of these countries are among the most restrictive in the world. Many countries in the region have tariffs almost twice the size of those in emerging Asia. And despite geographic proximity, countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia have lagged behind others in trade integration with Europe. These countries face significant problems with access to European markets, which has resulted in weak export performance and sluggish growth. They could also forge closer ties with new trade partners in the fast-growing emerging markets. We'd welcome **reactions from readers** in the Middle East, particularly from entrepreneurs from the region. Give us your thoughts on the way forward and what should be the priorities. Looking forward to your ideas.

In the past decade there have been stark differences in per capita GDP [growth in Europe. Growth rates have ranged from close to zero in Italy and Portugal to more than 4 percent in the best performers. **Why do some countries in Europe grow much faster than others?** And how can those falling behind catch up before it is too late? In part, these differences reflect 'convergence'\u009d. It is much easier for poor countries to grow faster than it is for rich countries because they can import technology they do not already have. It is much more difficult to grow fast if you are already rich and at the technology frontier'now you can only get richer by innovation. [ But convergence is only part of the story. **Some countries have grown much slower than what could be expected given how rich'or poor'they are, while others have grown much faster.** For instance, Italy and Portugal have grown slower than expected, while the Slovak Republic and Sweden have grown faster. **Integration into the global economy matters** [ **What explains these differences?** Both macroeconomic policies and barriers to growth. Heavily regulated goods and labor markets and inadequate institutions and macroeconomic policies have kept some countries less flexible, less competitive, and less integrated into the global economy than their better- performing peers. **Indeed, it is striking that better performing countries are much more integrated in the world economy than are poor performers**. Strong performers enjoyed high and increasing levels of trade, both in exports and in imports, while many of the poor performers have lower and stagnating levels. In Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, the share of export and import in GDP rose by about 15 percent to more than 20 percent between 1995 and 2010. The same was true for the Czech and Slovak Republics, and, to a lesser extent, Poland. At the other end of the spectrum, the export-to-GDP and import-to-GDP ratios of Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain stagnated over those years. [ **How to recover from euro sclerosis** The problem of slow growing countries in Europe is not new. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, many countries in Europe suffered from 'euro sclerosis'\u009d'high unemployment and low growth. These earlier periods provide important lessons, as they show that a change in policy _can_ turn an economy around. **Let's take the Netherlands and Sweden**.** **In the 1980s and 1990s, these two countries undertook sweeping reforms to boost growth after a long period of poor performance. Their experience gives us pointers to reforms that could help other countries reverse their economic fortunes.**** Both countries undertook reforms only after protracted economic malaise culminated in crisis. Income per capita was falling relative to that of Germany for about a decade; public finances were deteriorating, and fiscal deficits were growing. In the Netherlands, unemployment was rising because real wage costs were too high; in Sweden growth was held back by poor performing traditional industries, the banking crisis in the early 1990s, and stifling taxes. Both countries addressed both macroeconomic imbalances and barriers to growth. Reforms focused on the most onerous bottlenecks. **In the Netherlands, a main initial goal was to restore employment**, which had been hurt by labor costs, and thus the centerpiece of the reform package was a wage agreement between employers and unions. [ Other tax and benefit reforms also helped create jobs and encouraged more people to join the labor force. **Sweden tackled its core problems on several fronts: fiscal consolidation, tax reform, clean up of the banking sector, and an overhaul of the wage bargaining system.** Both countries also reduced regulation so new companies and industries could flourish. Although reforms spanned more than a decade and took time to yield full benefits, they were very successful'per capita income in both the Netherlands and Sweden is now significantly higher than even that of Germany. **So what are the lessons for current poor performers? ** * First, **reforms work'but they take time**. It takes time to do the reforms themselves. It takes times before their impact becomes visible'initially the economic situation may even get worse'and it takes time before the full impact is felt. But the benefits accumulate over time, and they can be significant. * Second, **addressing macroeconomic imbalances and removing barriers to growth are both essential**. If deficits and debt are not brought under control, growth is unlikely to pick up. But correcting macroeconomic imbalances without also removing barriers to growth will hardly result in sustained high growth. * Third, **what should be reformed changes over time**. As bottlenecks to growth disappear, new constraints become binding.__ ", "index": 570}, {"pub": "10/19/2011", "title": "What the Arab Spring Has Taught Us", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3997", "content": " [By [Masood Ahmed (Version in[ \u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) **As we launch the IMF's Arabic blog, _[Economic Window_, we are witnessing an historic shift in the Middle East and North Africa** (MENA). It is clear that the popular uprisings that began 10 months ago were born of a desire for greater freedom and for a more widespread and fairer distribution of economic opportunities. But the scale of protests in the region and the associated deplorable loss of life came as a surprise to everyone, including us at the IMF. Like others, we had pointed to the [ticking time bomb of [high unemployment, but we did not anticipate the consequences of the unequal access to opportunities. We had focused our efforts on helping countries in the region build solid macroeconomic foundations, liberalize economic activity, and introduce market-based reforms that would generate higher economic growth. IMF lending, policy advice, and technical assistance have indeed contributed to improving the economic indicators of many countries in the region. However, with hindsight, it is clear that we were not paying enough attention to how the benefits of economic growth were being shared. **Clear lesson** A clear lesson is that even [rapid economic growth cannot be maintained unless it is inclusive, creates jobs for the growing labor force, and is accompanied by social policies for the most vulnerable. For economic reforms to be sustainable, their gains must be broadly shared, not just captured by a privileged few. Widespread corruption is not just an unacceptable affront to the dignity of citizens, it also deprives them of the economic benefits. And the absence of transparent and fair rules of the game will inevitably undermine inclusive growth. **An equally important lesson is that a socially inclusive agenda will not survive without economic and financial stability**. Since the beginning of the year, the region has witnessed considerable uncertainty and economic pressures, from both domestic and external sources. The recent worsening of the global economy will add to these pressures. Countries have stepped up spending to respond to the needs and aspirations of their people. Higher spending is indeed necessary in the short term, but it needs to be designed such that it can be unwound later to sustainable levels in order to limit its long-term fiscal consequences. Given difficult economic circumstances, some countries will need official financial support. **Own path to change** Now is also the time to start formulating national reform strategies, essential for building confidence and providing the basis for sustained inclusive growth, and which some countries have already embarked upon. Each country must find its own path for change, but all will need to encompass commonly accepted goals of higher, job-creating economic growth; greater social and economic inclusion; strong institutions that ensure accountability and good governance; and social protection for the most vulnerable. **Leadership on the road ahead should come from countries themselves**. The international community can contribute to success of this agenda by providing an ambitious and multifaceted program of support, encompassing incentives such as financial assistance, market access, labor mobility, and credit guarantees. The [Deauville Partnership has brought together an impressive group of countries and institutions and could now become a valuable platform for driving the process forward. **Committed to help** Here at the IMF, we are fully committed to helping the region. We stand ready to provide financial support in the amount of about $35 billion to the region's oil-importing countries, if requested'in addition to the $38 billion pledged by the international and regional financial institutions. We are also expanding our technical assistance and looking at how we can adapt our work to reflect the lessons of the Arab Spring. And we are taking into greater consideration not just how our policy recommendations benefit the economy, but also how they affect different parts of the population. **While there are many uncertainties, and the months ahead will be challenging and inevitably marked by setbacks, we should not lose perspective of the potential long-term benefits of the Arab Spring.** The region has many strengths: a dynamic and young labor force, vast natural resources, ancient civilizations and rich culture that attract scholars and tourists, a large regional market, an advantageous geographic position, and access to some key markets.

Sayeh (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais) Suddenly it's the thing everyone is talking about. [Income inequality. Not just between countries, but inequality within countries. In North Africa and the Middle East, jobless youth sparked the Arab Spring. In the United States, the growing gap between rich and poor is the '[meta concern'\u009d of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Worldwide, frustrations appear to be on the rise. What about sub-Saharan Africa? Sustained economic growth has certainly produced some tremendous advances. But a large proportion of the population is still living in poverty. So frustrations about the inclusiveness of growth are also shared within the region. **C****omplex**** story** Is the story really as negative in sub-Saharan Africa as the relatively slow reduction in the incidence of poverty and some people's frustration suggest? Or is the underlying situation a little more complex? In July, [I wrote about the importance of inclusive growth and whether economic growth was a necessary or a sufficient condition for poverty reduction. The IMF's latest _[Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa_ takes that thinking a step further. The new analysis looks at how living standards for the poorest households have actually been changing in some countries in the region. **Inroads to poverty reduction** First, let's look at what the existing data tell us about poverty and growth. For the region as a whole, the percentage of the population living on less than $1.25 a day'at 2005 international prices'fell from 59 percent in 1996 to 51 percent in 2005. During the same period, the region's average growth rate more than doubled, from 2\u00c2? percent before1995 to over 5 percent in the early 2000s. The message seems to be that poverty fell, but that growth had a disappointingly weak impact compared with experience in other regions. The picture changes, however, when we begin to drill down a little into the data. For a start, if we compare the rate at which poverty declined among the better-performing countries in the region, we find that growth rates did seem to matter. The faster the country was growing, the larger, on average, the reduction in poverty. The relationship seems to have been less powerful than observed elsewhere in the world, but it was still significant. **Survey data** Household survey data are more revealing. We have been digging into this data to see how individual households have been faring, so that we can compare changes in living standards of families between different parts of the population. It would not be surprising if growth reduced poverty substantially in countries where a lot of households were initially just below the poverty threshold. But we wanted to look at a wider range of households. Amid the wealth of data in household surveys is information about what every household consumes, including food they grow themselves. And the extent to which consumption levels change over time can tell us a lot about whether growth has been inclusive. So we tracked changes in consumption'over five or six year intervals'in six fairly typical countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Cameroon, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. **Benefits of higher growth** The results support the idea that high growth was inclusive. * Among the poorest 25 percent of the population, per capita consumption levels increased substantially faster than inflation in three of the four higher growing countries we studied'annual increases averaged nearly 4 percent in real terms. * But there was much less sign of improvement in per capita consumption of poor households in the two low-growth countries. * Results for the sixth country were ambiguous because of uncertainty about the measurement of price changes. Our analysis also suggests that job creation in rural areas, particularly in the agricultural sector, is associated with more inclusive growth, increasing poor households' consumption growth and improving their living standards. This makes good sense, given that rural households account for about two-thirds of the population in the six countries we studied. More specifically: * In Uganda and Cameroon, we found that real per capita consumption increased faster among poor households than it did among rich households. At the same time, agricultural employment grew strongly. * In contrast, the poorest households in Mozambique and Zambia experienced weak or negative per capita consumption growth, while rural agricultural employment opportunities declined. **Policy considerations** It also seems that characteristics such as levels of educational attainment and household location go a long way towards explaining differences in consumption. This provides important guidance for policymakers. * Providing budget resources for improving and targeting health and educational services for instance, can greatly improve vulnerable individuals' well being and earning potential. * Well targeted transfer programs can help to make growth more inclusive by redistributing its benefits more widely. * Policies to enhance agricultural productivity'through improved inputs or infrastructure investment in energy, irrigation, or transportation'will further contribute to improved inclusiveness. The frustrations of the poor are all too understandable. But maybe there is more hope than some measures of poverty suggest. Growth is bringing gains, albeit fewer than we would like. However, the goal should be to do more. And we hope the findings in our analysis can help equip policymakers to better target support to those who most need it and design policies most likely to promote more equitable and lasting growth.

While the symptoms may be different, tackling inequality is no less an issue in Asia.** Indeed, **research shows that [inequality can be counterproductive to sustaining longer-term growth.** So, in increasingly turbulent global economic times, this gives added importance to promoting shared'or inclusive'growth in Asia that is more likely to be sustained. This has been a [major focus our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook_, which we presented in Manila today. A great challenge for the government here, and for other countries across the region, is to raise living standards for a wide section of their populations. **_Asia's record on equality_** **Over the past two decades, growth in most Asian economies has been impressive**; higher on average than in other emerging regions. This, in turn, has **translated into significant reductions in poverty**, highlighting the fact that growth in per capita incomes remains the key ingredient to poverty alleviation. Notwithstanding these successes, Asia still remains home to the largest number of the world's poor. **It may then seem counterintuitive that inequality across the region has also increased over the same two decade period.** This sits in stark contrast to the previous three decade record of equitable growth across much of Asia'in Japan, the newly industrialized economies (NIEs), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The rise in inequality has been much more pronounced than in most other emerging regions_, _leaving parts of Asia less equitable than the Middle East and approaching levels of inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. **Rising inequality has dampened the impact of Asia's fast growth on poverty reduction and, in many countries in the region, the gap between rich and poor has been growing.** Our analysis confirms that growth has been significantly less inclusive in many Asian economies. The income of the bottom fifth of the population has grown much more slowly than average incomes in China, the NIEs, and South Asia (excluding India). By contrast, in India and the ASEAN countries, incomes of the poorest fifth have kept pace with average income growth. And in Brazil, the poorest fifth have seen their incomes rise even faster than average, highlighting the much more equitable nature of its recent growth experience. **_The policy challenge_** **These trends are worrying, particularly given increasing evidence of the importance of greater income equality for sustained growth.** Accordingly, this is something we are paying close attention to in our regional economic assessments and in our policy dialogue with member countries in Asia. But one also does not need to be pessimistic. **There are many potentially beneficial policies that can be implemented, and many governments in Asia seem to be doing just that.** The problem is complex and will likely require a set of mutually reinforcing policies, and the necessary mix will vary from country to country. Let me briefly touch on some aspects of fiscal policy that we believe can make an important contribution. * The relatively low share of education and health spending in GDP across Asia points to an **important potential role for fiscal policy in strengthening inclusiveness**. Conditional cash transfer programs (CCT) are being increasingly used in low-income emerging economies and, in Asia, the introduction of a CCT in the Philippines is a welcome development. By 2012, this program is budgeted to cover 60 percent of the poor. * Countries in Asia with higher per capita income and lower poverty should make it a **priority to enhance other safety nets**. In particular, few emerging Asian economies have unemployment insurance schemes and many have low pension coverage rates'less than 20 percent of the working age population is covered in most of emerging Asia compared with an average of 60 percent in OECD countries. Enhancing such safety nets would help in two respects: increasing inclusiveness, and reducing precautionary motives to save, hence increasing consumption and facilitating global rebalancing. * **A key question about such policies is their fiscal cost**. The Bolsa Familia program in Brazil only costs 0.4 percent of GDP, and [recent IMF work on China and Korea argues that a minimum social safety net can be provided at low cost. So at least in some cases, policies to promote more inclusive growth need not be prohibitively expensive. Such reforms to social protection schemes, and health and education investment could be key elements of a broader strategy'which might also include, for example, labor, financial, exchange rate and governance reforms'to reduce the share of vulnerable households in Asia. Ultimately, rebalancing the benefits of Asia's fast growth in this way may hold the key to sustaining it in the years ahead.

Of the three main pillars of the IMF's work, technical assistance has been a sort of middle child; it doesn't get the attention of the oldest and youngest children, yet in many ways is the glue that holds the family together. The other two pillars are well known: we lend money to countries in times of need and crisis, and conduct annual check-ups of their economies and financial systems, known as surveillance. As countries around the world cope with the global economic crisis, the [IMF's technical assistance is a vital part of the work that we do to help countries prevent, prepare for and [resolve crises. Technical assistance also helps countries master the form and details to govern themselves in an effective and legitimate way. And as we adjust our way of doing things based on lessons from the recent crisis, we have to adapt the way we work to countries' needs and change how we measure success. A new strategy for technical assistance is under discussion at the IMF and there are **five key areas** we need to focus on: **adapting to countries' evolving needs, more cooperation with donors, new ways to deliver technical assistance, the importance of training, and a focus on results.** Here's why: **Serving our members best****'a key objective'will require constant adaptation to evolving needs**. The last few years have shown vividly how quickly new challenges can emerge. The IMF's rapid response to the global crisis is central to our work. We adjusted quickly and we will need to be prepared to continue to do so. New and complex areas of capacity building and training will require that our agenda be flexible, encompassing areas such as advice on crisis resolution, the linkages between countries economies' and their financial systems, and sustainable debt strategies. **Deepening cooperation with donors will make our work on capacity building more effective**: Donor contributions to finance IMF capacity building have made it possible for us to be responsive to rising demand, whether for basic or more specialized advice. In 2011, donors financed about 75 percent of technical assistance, up from about 60 percent in 2007. And the number of donor countries has almost doubled to over 40. **We must keep alert for new ways to enhance the delivery of technical assistance. Our **[**Regional Technical Assistance Centers** bring our expertise closer to the end-users and to zero in on key issues, facilitated by donor support. We will officially open the IMF's latest regional technical assistance center in Mauritius on October 17. We are already planning and working on securing support for another regional center to serve non-Francophone Western Africa. It will be the fifth center in sub-Saharan Africa and would boost coverage on the continent. **Technical assistance and training form a continuum and complement each other**. Their common goal is to [build capacity to support and realize good government policies. Training, for instance, can help officials acquire the skills they need to implement advice. After the global financial crisis struck, many countries used fiscal policy to cushion its impact, including some low-income countries that had earlier benefitted from debt relief. As their debt levels have again begun to rise, many countries are now asking for help in drafting medium-term debt management strategies. The IMF's technical assistance means a country doesn't have to start from scratch. We leverage the experience and expertise of people from over 100 countries so countries in need of help can adopt the best practices that work for them. Our resident representatives and regional center coordinators in countries try to stay in constant dialogue with international development partners, local and international civil society organizations and others so we can cooperate with other technical assistance providers. **We must stay focused on results. **An area close to my heart is how we can best measure the impact of technical assistance. We must ask questions like: what realistic contribution can we make to help a member country meet its strategic objectives, such as bringing in more revenue to create space for poverty-reducing expenditure? Questions like these are difficult; to answer them effectively, we must be more rigorous about our objectives and measurement. We have much to learn from some of our donor partners. They are calling for more results-based management, which can be useful not only to inform management decisions but also to identify and more clearly communicate our achievements. At the same time, we must be realistic about what can be achieved and measured.

The view from here in Tokyo'looking out at the region'may be more serene than the view from other advanced country capitals, but there are storm clouds on the horizon. **Policy balancing act** Asian policymakers are faced with an unusually delicate balancing act. On the one hand, domestic demand in Asia has been rather resilient, in contrast to most advanced countries. Factories are working at near full capacity and unemployment is low. Rather than the prospect of falling back into recession, overheating is the main concern in a number of economies, with credit growing strongly and inflation remaining stubbornly high. On the other hand, growth in Asia is slowing, mainly due to weakening external demand. So policies need to contend with softening exports, which act as a drag on growth, even as they seek to contain inflation and asset bubbles. **Guarding against spillovers** An intensification of turmoil in the euro zone could affect Asia through several channels. Foreign investors could withdraw abruptly (to some extent this is already happening, but things could get much worse). Stressed European banks could withdraw funding from their local branches and cut back on cross- border lending. And key derivatives markets'on which some local banks have become reliant'could be impaired. This would affect many regions, including markets in Asia where European banks have been important providers of dollar liquidity. How should policymakers in the region react to domestic challenges amid such an unsettled external environment? In a word, flexibly. * In overheating economies where monetary conditions are still loose, policies should be geared towards returning inflation to the target range. But policymakers should be willing to change direction quickly should downside risks materialize. * In economies where inflation is under control and global financial linkages are greater, a pause in monetary tightening is warranted. Asia's fundamentals are good, and the scope for policy adjustments is much greater than in other regions of the world. Asian low-income and Pacific Island economies face similar challenges, but often in a more acute form. In low-income countries, the fight against inflation is complicated by strong second-round effects and less well anchored inflation expectations. Pacific Island economies need to undertake further structural reforms to lift their potential growth. **Longer-term rebalancing** The weakness in global demand today only confirms that Asia would greatly benefit from [rebalancing growth towards domestic sources of demand. Naturally, this will take time. But efforts should start now. Re-prioritizing fiscal spending could be an important component of this effort. Directing public spending toward critical infrastructure investments would help with rebalancing. It could also help foster more inclusive growth'this is one area in which the region could do much better'and I will write more about that in coming days.

Adjusting the Economic Sails in Latin America", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3926", "content": " [By Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Eyzaguirre (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) As the European crisis lingers and advanced economies stall, **the next six to eighteen months will be challenging for Latin America.** Increased global uncertainties may create **headwinds** for the region'greater stress in the global economy and markets'**tailwinds**, if the advanced countries' problems are tackled and economies spring back to life, or **volatile gusts**'weak growth and continued uncertainty'like we are seeing now. But it's not easy to forecast the future of Latin America in these uncertain times, as we discuss in our just-published _[Regional Economic Outlook for Western Hemisphere_. (Here I focus on Latin America, but our report covers the whole region, including North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.) Today's global uncertainties are virtually unprecedented. But then again, much of Latin America is stronger today than in past decades. In most countries, inflation is generally under control; government budgets are in reasonably good shape; financial systems are stronger; exposure to the vagaries of international finance is lower; and exchange rates are allowed to move more to absorb shocks. We saw the results of these improved policies during the 2008'09 global crisis. While Latin America was hit by the global fallout, it bounced back strongly as the crisis receded, riding the dual tailwinds of buoyant commodity prices and easy external finance. [Until recently, it even seemed that these tailwinds were too strong'pushing some countries to overheating (growing inflation, widening current account deficits, and strong credit growth). And even with global growth weaker, Latin America should post solid growth this year and next, assuming that tailwinds persist. But now the tailwinds are fading. Commodity prices are still high, but have come down, and could fall further if world demand falters. International financial markets remain volatile, and their mood is unusually fluid day to day. If global uncertainties are resolved, the tailwinds could come back strongly. **Headwinds?** As we've said elsewhere, the world economy is in a [dangerous new phase. Confidence is fragile. If the problems in Europe aren't resolved, a collapse in confidence could trigger intense volatility in global financial markets. And another recession in the advanced countries would slow growth in Asian emerging markets, which has been supporting commodity prices'which, in turn, have bolstered Latin America's commodity exporters (see [Chapter 3 of our _Regional Economic Outlook_). The result: a heavy blow to the region. Capital flows could dry up, squeezing domestic credit markets. Growth could slow abruptly as foreign demand and commodity prices fall off. Many countries could find their currencies and financial conditions under pressure. And if a major emerging market elsewhere in the world comes under strain, investors will scrutinize Latin America's fundamentals, looking for weaknesses that would give them reason to pull out. **Tailwinds?** Alternatively, an early resolution to global uncertainties could stoke up confidence and renew the wave of capital inflows to the region. Advanced economies would likely maintain easy monetary policies, further propelling capital flows. Commodity prices could soar as global demand revives, particularly in emerging Asia. The dual tailwinds could pick up to gale force'and suddenly, countries could be confronted with overheating risks again. **Navigating through shifting winds** Given all this uncertainty about how winds might shift, what should Latin America's policymakers do? **I would propose three things**: * **First and foremost, countries should stay the course of gradual fiscal consolidation until global prospects are clearer**. The temptation to ramp up government spending now must be resisted. It would not only use up fiscal buffers that may be needed later to fight a real global downturn, but could also compromise fiscal policy credibility. [ * **Second, monetary policy needs to be nimble. **If countries need to fight a downturn when it appears, they should start with monetary policy, where easing is possible. Central banks that have a strong track record of controlling inflation, and where inflation expectations are well anchored, can afford to pause now, and even cut rates if risks materialize. But if uncertainties settle and tailwinds pick up, central banks may need to resume tightening. * **Third, all countries should keep an eye open for stress in their financial institutions and corporations**. While Latin America's banks are much more robust than in past decades, they are not immune to global storms. Officials particularly need to keep watch for liquidity strains; as the 2008'09 crisis showed, they can spread virulently to emerging markets countries. Meanwhile, if external finance remains cheap, and domestic credit is frothy, tighter prudential policies could protect financial sectors (see [Chapter 2 of our _Regional Economic Outlook_). So overall, **countries should stand ready to deal with the challenges of headwinds'and even the challenges of stronger tailwinds**. Making predictions and crafting policies in these uncertain times is hard. But as the saying goes, the best way to forecast the future is to influence it. And with the right policies, Latin America can influence its future, whatever winds may come.

They were here for the [2011 Annual Meeting of the IMF and World Bank, at which finance ministers and central bank governors mix with businesspeople, civil society, labor leaders, and parliamentarians to discuss the critical issues we face. Coming in to this Meeting, I had warned of a [dangerous new phase now facing the global economy and had called for [bold and collective action. Coming out of the Meeting, I feel strongly that the global community is beginning to respond. Why? Three reasons: a shared sense of urgency, a shared diagnosis of the problems, and a shared sense that the steps needed in the period ahead are now coming into focus. **_First, the sense of urgency_****** There was clear recognition of the gravity of our situation. The IMF's latest forecasts, released during the Meeting, indicate that global growth is projected to slow to 4 percent this year and next. The advanced economies will manage only an anemic 1\u00c2?'2 percent. Clearly, the recovery of the global economy remains worryingly weak and uneven. In addition, the risks are piling up'propelled by a negative feedback loop between weak growth, weak balance sheets'of governments, banks, and households'and weak political commitment to do what is required. This, in turn, has fuelled a crisis of confidence that imposes not only economic but also social costs. While the clouds may be darkest over Europe, there remains huge uncertainty in the United States. And what makes the situation all the more urgent is that it has implications for every country. In our interconnected world, what happens in the advanced economies affects everyone'the Kenyan farmer, the Brazilian designer, the Chinese entrepreneur. **_Second, the shared diagnosis_****__** The first priority, of course, must be to break the vicious cycle of weak growth and weak balance sheets feeding negatively off each other. It was widely recognized at the meeting that _the advanced economies are at the core of an effective resolution_'especially the United States and Europe. For the US, the main challenge is to adopt a credible strategy to reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium and long term, deal urgently with high unemployment, and relieve pressure on overly-indebted households. For Europe, the main challenge is to deal with the inter-linked problems of sovereign and bank debt'and deal with them together. Those attending the Annual Meeting were particularly encouraged by the determination of Euro-area countries to '[do whatever is necessary'\u009d to resolve the problems facing them.__ While the advanced economies must step up to the plate, the emerging market economies and low-income countries also have their part to play. Emerging market countries have a major role in helping to achieve the ultimate objective of rebalancing the global economy'with external surplus countries relying more on domestic demand and those with current account deficits taking action to ward off overheating. Low-income countries need to rebuild the policy buffers that served them well during the crisis, and invest in growth and employment creation as well. **_Third, the actions needed are coming into focus_** Policymakers at the weekend called for 'exceptional vigilance, coordination and readiness to take bold action.'\u009d This should span the following areas: * Fiscal policy must navigate the twin threats of undermining credibility or undercutting recovery. Advanced countries need fiscal consolidation as a matter of priority, but, for some, pushing too fast will harm growth and jobs. So the pace must neither be too hesitant nor too hasty. The approach must be country-specific. * Monetary policy should remain accommodative'given that inflation expectations are generally well-anchored in the advanced economies. And central banks should stand ready to dive back into unconventional waters as needed. * Financial sector reform is crucial. Bank balance sheets must be strong enough to continue to lend to fuel growth. We also still need stronger and more consistent financial regulation. * Structural reforms to boost competitiveness and growth beyond the immediate crisis are also important. And, in the process, we must pay attention to the social dimension. We need growth that supports jobs; we need growth that benefits the whole of society. As I said during the Meeting, the critical factor cutting across all of these is implementation, implementation, implementation. **_Support from the IMF_****__** I also emphasized that the IMF will support our member countries as they take these actions. I put forward an [Action Plan focused on making our economic analysis and policy advice more effective, strengthening further our lending toolkit and the global financial safety net, and continuing to provide much-needed technical assistance and training. **_Act now, act together_** So looking back on the weekend, I believe that the shared sense of purpose that emerged is very important for the global economy. That said, follow through'by all concerned'is now even more important. And that means taking action not in the years ahead, but in the weeks ahead. We are all in this together'we can only get out of it together.

Weaker growth prospects and larger downside risks to growth **have prompted investors to reassess the sustainability of the economic recovery'which appears increasingly fragile. **2\\. ****The reduced pace of the economic recovery and incomplete policy actions have stalled progress in balance sheet repair. **This has led to increased concerns about the financial health of government balance sheets in advanced economies, banks in Europe, and households in the United States. __ **In Europe,** **sovereign risks have spilled over to the region's banking system. **This has put funding strains on many banks operating in the euro area, and has depressed their market capitalization.**** * **We have quantified the size of these spillovers** on banks in the European Union since the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010. During this period, banks have had to withstand an increase in credit risk coming from high-spread euro area sovereigns that we estimate amounts to about '\u00ac200 billion. If we include exposures to banks in high-spread euro area countries, the total estimated spillover increases to '\u00ac300 billion. * This analysis helps explain current levels of market strains. But it does not measure the capital needs of banks, which would require a full assessment of bank balance sheets and income positions. * Because of increased market pressures, banks may be forced to **speed up deleveraging**, curtail credit to the real economy, and thus worsen the economic drag. Clearly, this must be avoided. **I****n the United States, t**here have been concerns'and much debate'about the **longer-term sustainability of U.S. government debt**. These concerns, if left unaddressed, could potentially reignite sovereign risks, and could have serious, adverse domestic and global consequences. At the same time, **U.S. households are still repairing their balance sheets**'a process that has affected economic growth, house prices, and U.S bank balance sheets. **The third factor driving the confidence crisis is weak politics.** Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have not yet commanded broad political support for the needed policy actions, and markets have begun to question their resolve. There is another important issue facing policymakers. Incomplete balance sheet repair in advanced economies, coupled with a **prolonged period of low interest rates**, can pose financial stability risks for both advanced and emerging markets. Low policy rates are necessary to support economic activity under current conditions. They can also buy time to repair public and private balance sheets. But if time is not well used, and these repairs remain incomplete, low rates can pose risks to longer-term financial stability by: * encouraging the buildup of excess pockets of leverage; * diverting credit creation to the more opaque shadow banking system; and * pushing capital flows toward emerging markets. What should policymakers do? They need to switch gears and shift their focus from treating the symptoms of the crisis to dealing with its underlying causes. **Advanced economies** **need to decisively and expeditiously resolve the** **current crisis** **of confidence.** Their biggest problems'rising sovereign risks, weak banks, and the spillovers between them'can only be tackled through **swift and comprehensive** **balance sheet repair**. * **Public balance sheets** in the United States, Europe, and Japan need to be bolstered through credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies. This is absolutely essential. * **Overstretched U.S. household balance sheets **might benefit from a more ambitious program of mortgage modifications involving principal write-downs. * And **banks in the European Union** need to cope with the spillovers from riskier sovereigns. They also need to have sufficient muscle to support the economic recovery through lending. **While significant progress has been made recently, banks need to build adequate capital buffers**. Some banks may need to do very little, but others'especially those heavily reliant on wholesale funding and exposed to riskier public debt'may need more capital. Private sources of capital should be tapped first. In those cases where this is not sufficient, injections of public funds may be necessary for viable banks. Weak banks need to be either restructured or resolved. **Emerging economies need to balance current risks to avoid future crises**. Given the track record of rapid credit growth in many emerging markets'often in the context of strong capital inflows 'policymakers need to avoid a further buildup of financial imbalances where credit growth remains elevated, even if capital flows have abated somewhat recently. In addition to sound macroeconomic policies, macroprudential and capital flow measures can play a supportive role in addressing these concerns. At the same time, emerging markets face a potential global shock that could lead to a reversal of capital flows and a drop in economic growth. **Our analysis shows that the impact on emerging market banks could be substantial and thus warrants a further buildup of capital buffers in the banking system.** The lack of sufficiently decisive policy action to finally address the legacy of the financial crisis has led to the present crisis of confidence. **This has thrown us back into the danger zone**, and poses a major threat to the global economy. Yet, while the path to sustained recovery has considerably narrowed, it has not disappeared. It is still possible to make the right decisions that will help restore global financial stability and sustain the recovery.** But for this, we need to act now; we need to act boldly; and we need to act in a globally coordinated manner. ** ", "index": 579}, {"pub": "9/21/2011", "title": "Fiscal Glass is Half Full: Some Reasons for Optimism", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3837", "content": " [By [Carlo Cottarelli ( In the midst of jittery financial markets, and global economic doom and gloom, it's easy to become pessimistic. Perhaps too much so; amid what seems like a steady drum beat of bad news, one can lose sight of what has been achieved over the last couple of years. Public debt and fiscal deficits in many advanced economies remain very high. Nevertheless, important progress has been made in fiscal adjustment in many advanced economies. **For most countries, government deficits have fallen substantially'by 2\u00c2? percentage points of GDP on average compared to two years ago. ** **The [fiscal outlook in most countries is stronger than we expected two years ago.** Let's take the five largest European countries. The chart below shows, in gray, the increase in the public debt to GDP ratio that we were projecting two years ago for the period 2012 through 2014. It also shows in blue the increase in debt over that same period that we are projecting today. As you can see, **debt ratios are now projected to go up by less than we previously expected**. In some cases, they are even expected to fall. This reflects the commitment that these countries have made to reduce their deficits over an extended period. **** Despite this progress, Europe's financial markets don't appear to think the region is doing enough on the fiscal front. What accounts for this gap between market perceptions and reality? **Communications may be part of the problem**. There is a cacophony of voices in the Euro zone, where 17 policymakers express their views, each with their own nuances. This creates a sort of uncertainty, where what financial markets want is a clear voice and message. Also, this summer's agreement by European leaders gives them more flexibility to address problems before they turn into full blown crises, but it still needs to be implemented. Doing so without further delay will send a clear political signal that Euro area members will continue to do whatever it takes to preserve confidence. So to the pessimists I say don't lose sight of what's been achieved. To the optimists (if there are any) I say don't underestimate what still needs to be done. **The task that fiscal policymakers face is complicated**. They need to ensure the public sector is not a source of instability by committing to a plan that will stabilize and then bring down public debt. At the same time, they need to make sure that the fiscal tightening associated with this objective does not itself become a source of instability by undermining the economic recovery, which is at a delicate moment. Some countries will have no choice but to tighten significantly in the short term, because of market conditions, while trying to minimize the growth fallout. Others facing easier financing conditions may have scope for a more moderate pace of short-term adjustment, especially if their medium-term commitment is seen as being highly credible. **The right mix**** of short- and long-term adjustment for each country will depend on its particular circumstances.** For the **United States**, for example, commitment to a credible program to reduce debt and deficits over the medium term could free up space for a short- term stance that is more attuned to the economic cycle. From this perspective, the American Jobs Act proposed by President Obama can play an important role in supporting growth and employment, if it is embedded in an appropriate medium-term framework to bring down the public debt. Given the size of the adjustment needed in the United States, this framework will need to involve an increase in tax revenues, and it will be important to ensure that the burden of this is distributed equitably across society. Reform of entitlements'both health care and social security'to contain the growth of spending on these items is also needed. However, it is critical that any debt reduction package be the product of a broad political consensus to give financial markets confidence that it will be adhered to over the long haul. To use an old clich\u00c3\u00a9, markets seem to be focusing on the fact that the glass is half empty, and ignoring the fact that it is also half full. **Perhaps the pessimists would be wise to pause, take a sip, and reflect on where we have come from before turning to face the admittedly very difficult challenges that remain ahead of us.** ", "index": 580}, {"pub": "9/20/2011", "title": "Strong Policy Action\u00e2\u20ac\u0094The Essence of Restoring Global Economic Hope", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3828", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard ( #### **The global economy has entered a dangerous new phase. The recovery has weakened considerably, and downside risks have increased sharply. Strong policies are urgently needed to improve the outlook and reduce risks. ** Growth, which had been strong in 2010, decreased in 2011. We had forecast some slowdown, due mainly to fiscal consolidation. One-time events, such as the tragic earthquake in Japan, offered plausible explanations for a further slowdown. The initial U.S. data also understated the size of the slowdown. Now that the numbers are in, it is clear that [more was going on. **Rebalancing Stalls** What was going on was the stalling of the [two rebalancing acts which, as we have argued in many previous reports, are needed to deliver 'strong, balanced, and sustainable growth.'\u009d **_Internal rebalancing:_** **What is needed to sustain growth is that households and firms increase their demand as fiscal deficits are being rolled back. This is not going well, for various reasons. **Tight bank lending, the legacy of the housing boom, and high leverage for many households, all turn out to be putting stronger brakes on the recovery than we anticipated. **_External rebalancing:_** If domestic demand is going to be low, advanced countries with current account deficits'in particular the United States'need to compensate for it through higher foreign demand. This in turn requires a corresponding shift away from foreign demand towards domestic demand in emerging market countries with current account surpluses, in particular China. **This rebalancing act is not taking place.** While imbalances narrowed in the crisis, this was due more to cyclical factors than to a structural adjustment of these economies. **Looking forward, we forecast an increase, rather than a decrease, in imbalances. ** **Financial worries** By themselves, these developments would have led us to reduce our forecasts. But **these problems have been compounded by a second major development, a sharp increase in financial volatility since the middle of the summer. ** **Markets have become more skeptical about the ability of governments to stabilize their public debt.** Worries have spread from countries in the periphery of Europe to countries in Europe's core, and to others, including Japan and the United States. Worries about sovereigns have translated into worries about the banks holding these sovereign bonds, mainly in Europe. These worries have led to a partial freeze of financial relations, with banks keeping high levels of liquidity and tightening lending. Fear of the unknown is high. Stock prices have fallen. These will adversely affect spending and growth in the months to come. **Growth slows** **These developments have, not surprisingly, led us to [revise our forecasts down.** We now forecast world growth to be about 4% for both 2011 and 2012, down from 4.5% in both years in our April forecast. **4% may not sound too bad but the recovery is very unbalanced. **For 2011, we see growth of 6.4% for emerging market countries, but only 1.6% for advanced countries. As usual'but it bears repeating here'the forecast assumes that policy commitments are met. **Otherwise things could be worse. Low growth, fiscal, and financial weaknesses can easily feedback on each other.** Lower growth makes fiscal consolidation harder. And fiscal consolidation may lead to even lower growth. Lower growth weakens banks. And weaker banks lead to tighter bank lending and lower growth. In short, there are clear downside risks to this forecast. Let me say a word about emerging and developing countries. So far, they have been largely immune to these adverse developments. They have had to deal with volatile capital flows, but in general have continued to sustain high growth. Looking forward, however, they may well face a more difficult environment, with more adverse export conditions, and even more volatile capital flows. **Decisive policy action** In light of the low baseline and the high risks, strong policy action is of the essence. It has to rely on three main legs. **_1) Fiscal policy. _Fiscal consolidation cannot be too fast, as it would kill growth. It cannot be too slow, as it would kill credibility.** The speed must vary across countries; the key continues to be credible medium term consolidation. Going beyond fiscal policy, measures to prop up domestic demand, ranging from continued low interest rates, to increased bank lending, to resolution programs for housing, are also of the essence. **_2) Financial measures. _Fiscal uncertainty will not go away overnight.** And even under the most optimistic assumptions, growth in advanced countries will remain low for some time. During that time, **banks must be made stronger, not only to increase bank lending, but also to reduce risks of vicious feedback loops.** For a number of banks, especially in Europe, this requires additional capital buffers, preferably from private sources, but if needed from public sources as well. **_3) External rebalancing._**_ _It is hard to see how, even with the policy measures listed above, US domestic demand can, by itself, ensure sufficient US growth. Thus, the US must rely more on foreign demand, or, in other words, reduce its current account deficit. A number of Asian countries with large current account surpluses, in particular China, have announced plans to rebalance from foreign to domestic demand. **These plans cannot be implemented overnight, but they must be implemented as fast as can be. ** **To conclude: Only if governments move decisively on fiscal policy, financial repairs, and external rebalancing, can we hope for stronger and more robust recovery. ** ", "index": 581}, {"pub": "9/19/2011", "title": "Weak Global Economy Tops Agenda at IMF-World Bank Gathering", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3814", "content": " [By [iMFdirect **Recent turbulence in financial markets and increased risks in the global economy mean that the [2011 Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank are taking place at a critical time for the global economy.** Economic leaders will come together to assess the state of the world economy and discuss the policy actions needed to deal with today's global economic challenges.

With taxpayers footing the bill for troubles in the financial industry in advanced economies during the global economic crisis, this discrepancy seems particularly galling to wage-earners who have seen their pay stagnate or worse. Inequality has started to attract more research by economists. The September 2011 issue of _[Finance &amp; Development_ (F&amp;D) looks at income inequality around the world and how it matters. **Small group of winners** The world has seen an unprecedented era of economic growth over the past decades, which has made people better off, on average. But overall the rich have done much better than the poor.

Our research found these investors generally do _not_ look at differences in interest rates among countries when deciding where to invest. It turns out **the factors they do consider in making these decisions are good and stable growth prospects, low country risks'including political and economic stability'and a stable exchange rate**. This all makes good sense for long-term investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. So why all this talk about how low interest rates in advanced economies are 'pushing'\u009d investment flows to emerging countries, where interest rates are generally higher'is this story wrong? Our [research for the **Global Financial Stability Report** used detailed data on flows into and out of bond and equity mutual funds to look at the underlying drivers of investment decisions made by institutional investors. These investors usually have a long investment horizon, with obligations that often stretch out over decades. They are focused on long-run returns, and'importantly'they invest their own cash, rather than investing with borrowed money. Interest rates just don't matter much for these investors. We looked at short- term interest rates, long-term interest rates, real interest rates, and nominal interest rates. Institutional investors generally did not respond to any of them, for investments in equities or bonds. **Interest rates matter for investors on borrowed time** There are two important nuances to this story. First, there is a **diversity of investors**; they come in many shapes and sizes, with different objectives and incentives tied to the source of their funds (their own cash or borrowed money), who they represent (pensioners or risk-takers), and their investment horizon. In addition to the behavior of long-term institutional investors, there is a set of investors that borrow the money they invest. This class'often referred to as leveraged investors'includes hedge funds and carry traders. Although the research doesn't cover these investors, there are a number of reasons to think **leveraged investors** are more likely to respond to interest-rate differentials. * Because leveraged investors borrow funds to invest, **the interest rate at which they borrow is a direct cost of doing business for them**, compared to an opportunity cost for unleveraged investors. This more direct link between interest rates and portfolio returns by definition makes them more sensitive to interest rate differentials between countries. * **Leverage generally increases risk**, since a smaller amount of initial investment controls a larger stake. The increased risk is likely to make their portfolio much more sensitive to all underlying fundamental investment drivers, including interest rates. Given that these two groups of investors appear to respond differently to interest rates, their relative size matters for the overall effect of interest rate differentials on investment flows.** The institutional investors we looked at have by far the largest amount of total assets to invest'over $70 trillion dollars**. Total investable assets of leveraged investors are much smaller, probably around one-tenth of the assets of institutional investors. While their invested assets may be smaller, we found their impact on market volatility may be large because leveraged investors trade much more frequently, moving money in and out of markets and countries looking for short-term opportunities to maximize the return on their portfolio. This is especially true in times of market turmoil, when leveraged investors may be forced to sell'for example to avoid losses that exceed their initial investment. **Long-term investors may be more inclined to ride out the storm** since they don't have to return any borrowed funds. The second nuance to the story is that even longer-term investors could become more sensitive to the level of interest rates if the current low-interest rate environment persists. Low interest rates hurt the financial position of institutional investors that need to earn a certain minimum return, such as pension plans that have made pension promises based on much higher expected rates of return than they can earn in the current environment. For now, most of these institutional investors are biding their time, accepting lower returns without moving funds to countries with higher interest rates and perceived higher risk, or into other riskier domestic assets. The longer the low interest rates prevail, however, the more difficult the financial situation of these investors becomes and the higher the pressure for them to 'search for yield.'\u009d Still, over the long run, the story remains intact. Long-term investment flows are likely to be dominated by long-run institutional investors, who look mostly at growth prospects and country risks. Interest rate differentials between countries are likely not to affect these longer-term flows. ", "index": 584}, {"pub": "9/11/2011", "title": "Darn Them Piggies! Pork Prices & the Inflation Outlook for China", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3774", "content": " [By [Nigel Chalk (Version in [\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6??) _It was pretty clear to me on a recent visit that China has become one of the biggest global markets for__ _[_Angry Birds__. The game was everywhere and around 100 million Chinese downloads are expected this year. It made me wonder if this was somehow linked to rising concerns over inflation and a way of getting back at those (increasingly expensive) mischievous green pigs.****_ [During the past year, views on China's economy have yo-yoed from concerns about the recovery, to hand-wringing about inflation and overheating, and then back to talk of hard landing. **Certainly inflation has been a key feature of the environment this year in China and one should pay close attention to it.** Rising inflation is a crucial social concern and takes a heavy toll on household incomes that are already struggling to keep up with economic growth. **Overheating?** Here at the IMF, the China team's view'surprising though it may be to some'has been that Chinese inflation should peak in the middle of this year and, by late-2011, move on to a declining trend. No reason, then, to get too excited about inflation. **But then we get asked a lot 'how does a red hot Chinese economy manage to escape inflation and defy the economic laws of gravity that other economies face?'\u009d** **The first thing to note is that China continues to have chronic excess capacity in a range of highly competitive manufacturing sectors.** This leaves companies with little pricing power, diluting the inflationary impetus from strong demand. At the same time, there is still an overall excess supply of labor in China (despite shortages of highly skilled workers) and this helps keep wage growth from getting too far ahead of productivity. It would be pretty unlikely for an economy that is investing almost half of its GDP and has a structural surplus of labor to hit meaningful capacity constraints and 'overheat'\u009d in the usual sense. Bottlenecks? Yes. Skills gaps? Certainly. Generalized overheating? No. **That's not to say there's no inflation problem.** Demand pressures in China manifest themselves in two very different ways. The first is through asset price inflation, notably property prices. The economy does well and house prices shoot up. Policymakers then have to step in with administrative measures to restrain the bubble. (I [wrote about this recently.) **Feasting on inflation** Second, **China faces large and volatile inflationary impulses from food.** Why is inflation so concentrated in this particular slice of the consumption basket? Mainly because the supply-demand balance for food in China is exceptionally tight and the supply response to higher food prices is both slow and weak. This makes for a precarious mix where any disruption in domestic supply'due to weather or disease'immediately translates into an amplified impact on raw food prices. Rising global prices for food only make the overall situation more difficult. **This isn't simply a matter of importing more food to offset domestic supply disruptions. China's food demands are just way too big.** China both produces and consumes one-sixth of the world's wheat, one-fifth of the world's corn, one-third of the world's rice, and one-half of the world's pigs. Equally, the structure of China's agricultural industry and the limited availability of agricultural land hamper an effective domestic supply response (on these deeper issues Stephen Green has produced a [series of great analytical pieces). **So China finds itself exposed to large and random food shocks, mostly domestically driven, which sporadically batter the consumer price index.** The initial impact from shocks to raw food then seeps into other parts of the consumption basket, shows up for a bit in nonfood inflation, and dissipates after about 6-12 months. While macroeconomic policy can help dampen the pass-through from food to other items, it can do little to counter the fundamental source of these pressures. Coming back to the most recent inflationary episode. Our take is that the initial shock this time around materialized in fresh fruit, vegetables and grain in the first half of 2010, due mostly to weather. Toward the end of 2010 we saw inflation start to feed through to other items in the consumption basket, coinciding with a moderate easing of credit conditions around the same time. By the Spring of this year, the momentum was starting to fizzle, partly dampened by a tightening of macroeconomic policies. Inflation peaked in July and was all set to quickly retreat in the latter part of this year. **Pork happens** **Unfortunately, just as China appeared to be heading out of the (inflationary) woods, pork happened. An ongoing (and literal) hog cycle, embellished by some localized pig disease, caused pork prices to skyrocket.** We are now seeing this feed back into inflation more broadly, starting up the transmission mechanism again. Given that this process is well underway, it would seem premature to now start to backpedal on macroeconomic policies. [ The good news is that this particular food price shock should be smaller than in the past; the hog-cycle will soon turn and the effects should wash out reasonably quickly. The bad news, though, is that **the return to more normal times and lower inflation will be postponed once again.** Darn them piggies!

So many countries around the world face the legacy of terrible hardships that have left them scarred and fragile. Everyone agrees that countries need help to recover from these situations. But it is not easy to come to a shared understanding on what this really takes. **Some have questioned whether the IMF has a meaningful role to play.** They argue that engagement in fragile states'countries with weak institutions and infrastructure, internal conflict, and governments that face difficulties delivering core services to the population'should mainly be left to bilateral donors and development institutions. **And they couldn't be more wrong.** Helping a country's economy to work better'the IMF's core expertise'is a central building block to move beyond fragile situations and achieve better lives for its citizens. **Doing it better** **A **[**recent review**** found that the IMF has played an important positive role in fragile states**, principally through the programs we support, technical assistance, and training. This has helped strengthen macroeconomic policies and build institutional capacity. This doesn't mean we always got it right. **We can do better. There is plenty of scope to adapt how we engage**, moving toward a more graduated, flexible, and longer view approach that is better suited to the needs of these countries. Thankfully, we are not alone in this endeavor. The [OECD, the [World Bank, regional development banks, bilateral donors, and the [g7+ group of countries experiencing conflict and fragility have produced deep analysis of the complexity of fragile and conflict-affected situations. They continue to develop recommendations on how the international community can work more efficiently in these instances. **More flexibility** So, how can the IMF be more flexible? And how can it deepen cooperation with other partners? We have a few ideas on the table. Promoting macroeconomic stability is a top priority. But, these countries face severe capacity constraints, so **we need to be realistic about the timeframes for taking policy actions**. **This calls for flexibility in designing economic programs supported by the IMF and, as emphasized by top experts, strict prioritization.** ****The international community is keenly aware of the need for 'quick wins'\u009d when engaging in fragile situations to foster buy-in from the local population for the transition out of fragility. **The IMF can strive to incorporate 'quick wins'\u009d identified by others'such as restoration of electricity services or jobs programs for unemployed youth'into sustainable medium-term macroeconomic policies. ** **Fuller use of the IMF's **[**Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)****'a low conditionality, low access facility'could allow for more gradual adjustment during the critical initial stages of transition in low-income countries**. This could help ease the burden of adjustment in line with capacity. Subsequently, as progress is made, support would be provide through the IMF's [Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which allow higher financing with tighter conditionality standards. To facilitate such an approach, adapting some modalities of the RCF, such as financing limits, could be considered further. The long-term financing needs of countries in fragile situations are best served by highly concessional donor resources. Even then, the IMF could seek to stimulate further support from donors from countries in fragile situations. For instance, **we could promote inclusion of budget support windows in multi- donor trust funds (managed by others), with a link to IMF-supported programs or IMF monitoring**. [Technical assistance and training in fragile situations is also crucial to success. In partnership with development agencies, the IMF is seeking ways to offer **more on-site expertise to assist country officials with day-to-day policy implementation.** **Fragile situations are not the exclusive domain of low income countries. We need to also consider the needs of fragile middle income countries.** While these countries may have higher financial resources and higher technical capacity than their low-income counterparts, many still face a complex and risk-laden path out of fragility. **Creating an RCF-like facility'limited conditionality, low financing'could well be useful to boost early IMF engagement with some of these countries** and, thus, help speed up the response of the whole international community. **Continuing the conversation** In the_ _months ahead, we will refine the above ideas and develop guidance to embed in our operations greater flexibility of IMF engagement. As this work proceeds, we can greatly benefit from further discussions with the wider IMF membership, development partners, and civil society. The next major opportunity to continue this dialogue will be at a [high-level public seminar in Washington later this month in the margins of the [IMF's Annual Meetings. ********** The public seminar, _Fostering Engagement with Fragile States_, will be held on Thursday, September 22, 2011 from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at IMF Headquarters in Washington DC.

The dataset is the most comprehensive ever assembled to assess this issue. The results show the beneficial effects for social spending in program countries in several respects. First, **social spending increased at a faster pace in countries with programs** compared to those without, particularly for low-income countries with programs (see chart). This is true for social spending in relation to GDP and as a share of total government spending, as well as increases in per capita social spending after adjusting for inflation. [ Second, the **benefits for social spending have accelerated over time in low- income countries**. * The median annual increase in education and health spending in low-income program countries since 2000 was more than double the average increase during 1985-1999. The rate of increase since 2000 implies that education and health spending, as a share of GDP, would increase each decade by 0.7 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. * Because GDP is also growing rapidly in these economies, increases in spending relative to GDP imply large increases in spending per capita. The rate of spending growth since 2000 suggests that education and health spending per person, after adjusting for inflation, would rise by about 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, over a 10-year period. Of course, IMF-supported programs are not the only determinants of a country's social spending. Many other factors'age profile of the population, income levels, and macroeconomic conditions'come into play. A fair test of the impact of IMF-supported programs on this spending must take these factors into account. Using statistical techniques that distill the impact of an IMF-supported program, as distinct from these other factors, we again find that **IMF- supported programs have a positive, and even stronger, effect on the rate of increase in social spending in low-income countries**. For example, over a five-year period with IMF-supported programs, education spending increases in low-income countries by about \u00c2\u00be percentage point of GDP; and by about 1 percentage point of GDP for health spending. **_Facilitating social spending_** The IMF is committed to help protect or increase social spending in the programs it supports in low-income countries. In this regard, there are numerous channels through which programs help spur higher spending in education and health, including: * Reforms that increase government revenues'on average, program countries increase revenues at a brisker pace than non-program countries'help create 'fiscal space.'\u009d * IMF-supported programs help countries mobilize donor financing. * To the extent that programs lead to higher growth, they can help generate greater fiscal space. * Finally, the emphasis in these programs on using additional resources'including those generated by debt relief'to support poverty-reducing spending contributes to rising shares of education and health spending. The results suggest that IMF-supported programs are compatible with the efforts of countries to boost critical social spending to improve social outcomes. But, it will be equally important, as many scholars have emphasized, to improve the targeting and efficiency of public spending to make it a more powerful instrument for bettering the lives of the poor.

Rascally moles would pop their cute little heads out of holes in the ground and your task was to use a giant rubber mallet to wallop the poor critters back from where they came. China's bubbly housing market makes me think that this game could be ready for a comeback. **There's a lot of talk these days of a bubble in China's property market.** Certainly there's no shortage of super-sharp investors and analysts that have very strong (and very diverse) views'see what [ James Chanos, [Andy Rothman, and [Nouriel Roubini have to say. The China team at the IMF is regularly asked about this. The question crops up in many different guises: Is China's property sector going to crash? What about all those empty apartments that have no one living in them? Have you seen the remarkable and pristine [ghost towns in Ordos? Isn't all this going to end badly? The various viewpoints certainly shift as one travels from the familiar cities of Beijing and Shanghai to witness the [construction fever in the 'smaller'\u009d megalopolises of China. Assessing the situation is not helped by the variety of different data sources that portend to tell the story of China's real estate sector. In addition, vocal commentators complicate, rather than clarify, the situation by drawing on a palette of colorful anecdotes to paint a picture for the economy as a whole. In all of this, there is one thing about which everyone agrees. A healthy property sector in China is essential for a healthy economy. Property occupies a central part of the economy with tentacles that link into both upstream and downstream sectors. Steel, cement, glass, furniture, refrigerators and automobiles are all reliant on housing. The fortunes of Chinese real estate cannot be ignored. So, then, what is our story on Chinese real estate? It is certainly true that China, perhaps more than anywhere, finds itself managing a potent cocktail of ingredients that fundamentally fuel property price inflation. * **Domestic savings are high** and, in large part, held captive by a comprehensive system of capital controls that prevents Chinese households and companies from diversifying internationally. * Yet, **opportunities for investing those savings domestically are limited**'the bulk of savings are held as bank deposits, earning interest that is well below the rate of inflation. * **It's cheap to buy property and hold it**, waiting for the capital gains to accrue'there's no property tax, no capital gains tax, and the real cost of financing home purchases is still very low. * Finally, **housing demand in China is underpinned by some powerful drivers**, including rapidly rising living standards and an ongoing process of urbanization that will persist for years to come. All of these forces have led the real estate market in some of China's largest cities to look decidedly bubbly. **The government has confronted these forces with a menu of measures**. Such measures include limits on speculation and restrictions on purchases by non-owner occupiers, and the financial system is being protected through curbs on leverage and limits on loan-to-value ratios. These are all having a tangible effect, dampening prices and bringing down the volume of 'frothy' transactions while still sustaining a healthy pace of private investment and construction. It also seems that the government is getting better at calibrating these measures, in part through ongoing learning-and-doing. Nevertheless, **all of these efforts are still only treating the symptom of the problem**'the pace at which house prices are going up'but the underlying impetus remains in place. Ultimately, the solution has to involve higher interest rates (on both deposits and loans), efforts to create a broader set of financial assets for the population to invest in, and a broad-based property tax that covers the majority of China's housing stock. None of this will be politically easy and it will all take time. However, only this kind of deep-rooted change will create the environment where households view their apartments as shelter rather than as a (literal) concrete store of value. Until then, policymakers will continue to have to periodically step back into the property market with successively tighter administrative controls, continuing to play Whack-a-Mole with China's burgeoning property bubble.

Against this, the economy should get a push from private investment and an increase in exports driven by the global recovery. Labor productivity may also rebound and improve competitiveness. Led by these forces, the IMF is expecting a bumpy and uneven recovery in the U.K. and our updated growth forecast for the near term, taking into account the recent GDP release for the second quarter, will be published with the September World Economic Outlook. Over the medium term, we expect growth to accelerate gradually to about 2\u00c2? percent. But volatile commodity prices, the uncertain magnitude of fiscal headwinds, and problems in the eurozone have added a lot of uncertainty to this outlook. It's not easy to steer a clear course in such circumstances. **Three scenarios** In our recent [discussions with policymakers, we outlined different scenarios for the U.K. economy. The precise nature of the policy response will, of course, depend on which way the wind blows. _**'\u00a2** **Stronger growth and higher inflation.**_ If growth and inflationary pressures are stronger than expected, monetary tightening will need to accelerate, and all fiscal windfalls should be saved. _****_ _**'\u00a2** **Prolonged slump and subdued inflation.**_ If there are signs the economy is entering a prolonged period of weak growth, high unemployment, and subdued inflation, rapid action may be needed to kick-start growth to avoid the slump becoming entrenched. If this happens, the risk is that productive capacity could be permanently lost, as temporary job losses morph into long- term unemployment due to job-seekers losing skills and dropping out of the labor market. Such measures to kick-start growth could include a combination of expanded asset purchases by the Bank of England and temporary tax cuts, combined with further reforms of pension and other entitlement programs to safeguard fiscal sustainability and market confidence. _****_ _**'\u00a2 Weak growth and high inflation.**_ If a slump weren't bad enough, add to that high inflation. If that scenario unfolds, the appropriate response will depend on what is the root cause. If volatile commodity prices are the main driver of price increases, policies need not respond as long as there remains little evidence that commodity price spikes are producing more persistent price pressures. But if weak growth and high inflation are the result of labor and skills shortages, as evidenced by rapid wage growth, policymakers would have little choice but to tighten monetary policy. A narrower output gap would also imply a higher structural deficit and would therefore require more fiscal adjustment over the medium term. **The most important thing for the government is to stay nimble, and be ready to alter course, should any of these scenarios manifest themselves**. For now, staying the course and implementing the wide-ranging policy program that was agreed last year seems the right thing to do.

And, right now, this leaves U.S. fiscal policy between a rock and a hard place. How much savings should be found and in what form are crucial questions. So is when to put those savings in effect. **Simply unsustainable** By the end of this year, federal debt held by the public will represent 70 percent of the U.S. economy, almost double the 36 percent it was in 2007. The federal fiscal deficit will be 9.3 percent of GDP this year. That, quite simply, is not sustainable. _If_ left on automatic pilot, debt would continue to increase faster than the economy, until financial markets say 'no more.'\u009d Credit rating agencies have issued their warnings and, as part of the debt ceiling discussions, the political system has been trying to decide where to find the savings. **Unemployment worries** At the same time, too much fiscal retrenchment in the short run could unduly weaken an economy that was recovering very gradually and has lately lost momentum. In the first half of 2011, output appears to have grown at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent. That pace is just not enough to significantly reduce today's very high unemployment. Persistently weak conditions in the labor market can threaten the long run prospects of the economy. A person who is unemployed for too long can gradually lose his or her work skills and find it increasingly difficult to find a job. Another headwind to economic activity is certainly not welcome at this juncture. **Difficult balancing acts** The fiscal problem was center stage in the [IMF's 2011 annual assessment'or [Article IV consultation'of the United States' economy. Discussions centered on the need to balance long- term adjustment and short-term support for the recovery. A loss of fiscal credibility in the United States is too dangerous a scenario to be tested. So, the top priority is reaching political agreement on a comprehensive adjustment plan that begins the consolidation process in FY 2012. The plan should be an appropriate size. Ideally, the consolidation should be spread over several years to avoid overly tight policies in 2012-13. The plan has to be balanced to include cuts in discretionary spending, higher revenues'for example by closing tax loopholes'and entitlement reforms. The latter should focus on containing the rate of growth entitlements'namely, social security and health care'and the changes may kick in later, but they have to be agreed and legislated now. Curbing non-defense discretionary spending alone is not sufficient because this type of spending is simply not large enough to achieve the required deficit reduction. **No crash dieting, but the diet has to start now** A somewhat crude analogy is dieting and losing weight. An overweight person who urgently needs to shed pounds must start to diet immediately. A simple announcement that he or she will start soon is not credible. By the same token, slashing the calorie intake too quickly is dangerous, risking the proverbial yo-yo dieting or, worse still, long term damage to your health. A gradual and enduring process is better. And the appropriate balance also requires relying on more than one lever: the dieter should not only eat less, but exercise too. Putting public debt on a sustainable path'say, stabilizing its ratio to the size of the economy by mid-decade and then lowering it gradually'requires a fiscal adjustment whose size and scope depends on two key variables: the pace at which the economy grows, and interest rates in the next several years. If the economy expands, the benefits multiply. Not only do revenues grow more rapidly, but debt also represents a smaller part of the economy, which reduces the need for savings. On the other hand, higher interest rates increase the amount of adjustment required because the interest bill will eat more of the available revenue. And complicating matters, higher debt tends to lift interest rates, raising the interest bill, and so on. So, where does all of that leave us? Active polices to lower the fiscal deficit of the order of 5 percent of GDP in the next several years would do the trick based on official U.S. projections. That amount is broadly equivalent to the $4 trillion savings over 10 years publicly discussed by policymakers during debt ceiling negotiations. Under our more conservative economic projections, the United States needs to find savings of approximately $6 trillion. That $4 trillion would be a very good first step. If you want to crawl out from between a rock and a hard place, you have to start now.

The sovereign debt crisis is a serious challenge, which requires a strong and coordinated effort by all involved to finally put it behind us. Surviving the storm will be of little consequence if the euro area finds itself trapped in the perpetual winter of low growth. [Germany may be expanding at record speed right now, but it wasn't so long ago when it grew much more slowly'just 1.5 percent per year between 1995 and 2007. In contrast, Sweden grew by 3 percent a year and the United States by 2 percent during the same period. Many experts fear that without reforms, growth in Germany could drop even lower in the next 5'10 years and beyond when global trade cools again. The situation is worse in the countries that currently find themselves in the eye of the storm. High growth'that relies on both strong exports and healthy domestic demand'is a must to preserve the stability and resilience of the region's Economic and Monetary Union. **Reforms to deepen economic governance** The course to higher growth leads through structural change and deeper economic integration. All of this is easier said than done, of course. Governance reform to deepen integration can be grueling work. But in light of recurring sovereign debt troubles, it will be crucial to improve collective fiscal discipline. This will require: * A stronger Stability and Growth Pact * National fiscal institutions with more say * Completing the budding European financial stability framework Stronger economic governance will support confidence in the euro area and help calm down volatile markets that threaten to deter investment and lower growth. **How to lift growth** Yet, the even bigger worry is that the euro area could fail to lift growth. Higher growth is crucial, not only because it would make for a stronger currency union, but also because the potential for improvement is large. Research conducted as part of the [IMF's regular euro area surveillance suggests that the right reforms could lift annual growth by about \u00c2? -1\u00c2? percentage points depending on a country's starting condition'no small feat. The key will be to make labor and capital more productive through better technological progress, with the help of deregulation and investment in workers' skills**.** Growth also tends to be much higher where market integration is deeper, likely reflecting the beneficial impact of competition on investment and innovation. [ **Seizing the moment** All this suggests that higher growth is not only feasible but linked to very specific reforms, including national efforts to make product and services markets more flexible and completing the single European market. The mobility of equity capital is particularly crucial, not least in the financial sector where the desire to protect 'national champions'\u009d has limited cross-border takeovers in the past. The key will be to seize these opportunities while the memory of the crisis remains. Europe has faced rough weather before. As the IMF's John Lipsky recently [remarked, the story of European integration since the Second World War has been an incredible success'not least because the leaders that built the European Union and the euro area looked beyond the crises of their day. If today's policymakers want to successfully stay the course, they will have to press ahead with structural changes and deeper economic integration. Many welcome initiatives are under way'from planned improvements to the Stability and Growth pact, to the measures promised under the Euro Plus Pact to improve competitiveness and strengthen fiscal discipline. But the reforms are not yet strong enough to ensure success, and politicians and the public remain reluctant to renew their vows to the European project. Additional steps are needed to make them succeed. To put the crisis behind us, we need more Europe, not less. And we need it now.

Governments care about what it can achieve: more jobs and more income for more people. An increasing number of African countries have been growing robustly for more than a decade. But while growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction and employment creation, is it also sufficient? When growth first takes off, it is typically associated with steady progress in several dimensions of poverty reduction: incomes rise and countries are able to finance [more spending on health and education, which translates into much-needed progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. But after this initial spurt, other questions arise. In particular, a number of countries are increasingly concerned about how inclusive growth is; are the benefits well-spread or do they accrue only to the few? [ Inclusive growth that creates jobs and raises income matters not only because of issues of social justice, peace and political stability. **Inclusive growth matters because it** **can start a virtuous growth circle**. The poor typically spend more of their income to meet basic needs, so if a poor person's income rises, they will spend most of it, creating a ripple effect. Rising incomes and rising profits support demand, which in turn fuels more growth in incomes and profits. In addition, production on a larger scale, along with better health and nutrition, improve worker productivity, making products cheaper and more plentiful still. [Studies also suggest that high income inequality, especially in low income countries, inhibits growth. Two factors may have played a role in limiting the benefits of economic growth: * In some cases, growth has been concentrated in the natural resource sector. But mining and oil enterprises are capital intensive, meaning they create little domestic employment. They can also be difficult to tax, and only a small share of the profits is retained in the country and used to reduce poverty. * The flip side of large natural resource sectors with limited employment opportunities is that the majority of the population in most African countries continues to depend on small-scale or subsistence agriculture. With relatively little investment in public infrastructure in recent decades, and limited access to financing, agricultural productivity has often remained low and households have remained cash poor. [ A number of African countries are now taking on the fundamental challenge to bring about more inclusive growth, drawing on the successful programs in other countries with large poor populations, such as Brazil, China and India. Some examples: * Countries are implementing **policies to create jobs by increasing productivity and diversifying economic activity**, particularly in agriculture, public infrastructure, such as transportation, water, and energy, as well as regulatory reforms. For example, **Mozambique's **new poverty reduction action plan increases spending for job-creation in agriculture, while **Uganda **has earmarked public savings to finance a new hydro-electric project. **Tanzania** is redoubling efforts to eliminate red tape impeding private enterprise. * Countries are **weaving stronger social safety nets** ' public resources transferred directly to the poorest ' to reduce income inequality and help protect people who are vulnerable during economic downturns. For example, **Ethiopia **created a cash and food transfer program that improved food security and retained livestock holdings. **Rwanda** established cash transfer and public works programs that reduced extreme poverty dramatically. * Numerous countries are looking at introducing or **changing tax regimes for natural resources** to ensure that more profits stay in the country, including **Democratic Republic of the Congo**, and **Liberia**. At the same time, countries are putting in place more transparent procedures to manage these resources. **The IMF is working with its member countries to support their quest for more inclusive growth: ** * Programs and policy advice to reinforce countries' existing efforts to boost productivity and diversify production, such as processes to identify and select investment projects with widespread returns, as well as simple and transparent rules for starting businesses. * Technical assistance to manage natural resources, from redesigning tax systems to establishing sovereign wealth funds ' special accounts to manage and safeguard the monies until needed - as well as rules for spending them as intended, and mandatory public monitoring. * The design and financing of social safety nets, to provide social protection, and create automatic stabilizers, which rapidly expand government spending to contain the impact of economic shocks. The IMF's next Regional Economic Outlook for Africa, which will be released in October of this year, will explore these questions in more depth. For many countries, the first priority remains to establish economic stability and create the conditions for robust economic growth. But for an increasing number of countries, the distribution of the benefits of growth has started to dominate the agenda. As countries strive for progress toward the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, these questions are of critical importance.

The former is known as money laundering and the latter as terrorist financing. In the [United States alone, profits from these crimes are estimated around [$275 billion, excluding tax evasion. Our [research_ _shows this dark side of the economy has destructive consequences for a country's financial stability, economy, and governance. **Large-scale financial fraud impacts people's lives**. For example, a large bank failure caused by fraud or insider trading may seriously damage the overall integrity of the financial market. The subsequent loss of confidence could cause the currency to lose value, which in turn can result in higher inflation and the erosion of real income and purchasing power for basic goods and services. **Corruption** undermines the integrity and stability of markets and governance, as well as confidence in the financial sector. **Tax evasion** on a wide scale literally means money destined for the governments' coffers to pay for schools, hospitals and roads is diverted elsewhere. **Terrorist attacks** and other forms of crime cause destruction and death, spread fear, shake confidence, and undermine the tourism industry. And the whole vicious cycle is powered by [money laundering, which helps clean the proceeds from most illegal activity and re-injects it in the legal sectors of the economy. All of this results in **reduced government revenues**, resources diverted from more productive activities, and unfair competition, which negatively impact economic activity and growth. And the damage isn't limited to one country; **the destabilizing effects of these activities can spill over onto the economies of neighboring countries and trading partners.** The IMF has worked with countries to [combat money laundering and terrorist financing for over 10 years, mostly by assessing then improving the rules and regulations set up by countries, and by helping to shape international policies in these areas. With the benefit of all this experience, we decided it was time to consider a [new, risk-focused approach to add depth to the way we assess money laundering and terrorist financing. In the months ahead, we and our colleagues from the World Bank will be discussing the possibility of moving to this new approach with the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a group of countries that sets international standards in this area. Our starting point for this new approach was to recognize that countries do not face the same risks of money laundering and the crimes that generate the money in need of laundering. Countries need help to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including * **legislation** to combat money laundering and terrorist financing * criminal justice systems capable of **prosecuting money launderers and terrorist financiers,** and confiscating their assets * measures to enable **financial and non-financial institutions to identify their customers** and verify the information they are providing, known as customer due diligence * **supervision** of financial and non-financial institutions * measures to **prevent the** **misuse of legal persons**, such as companies, foundations, and associations, for criminal purposes or criminals from controlling them * financial** intelligence units ** * domestic and international **cooperation ** One size may not fit all, and our response must be tailored to specific circumstances and needs to be more effective. We think that following a targeted, risk-focused approach would mean our assessments would be more cost-effective and focused on the issues that matter most for countries. The IMF's check-ups on the health of a country's financial system, called the [Financial Sector Assessment Program, already include anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, and together with the World Bank we will keep this up and also dig deeper. When criminal behaviors pose risks to the financial system or impact the countries neighbors, we'll have a more rational and in-depth coverage of money laundering and predicate crimes in both our financial assessments and in the annual IMF check-ups of a country's economy, known as the Article IV consultation. __ _ _We're [changing the way we tackle money laundering and terrorist financing so we can keep up with the times.

While many countries are slogging through a tough fiscal time, there is some good news, including in the United States where the deficit will be lower this year than previously expected. I will also give you an assessment of how the new information affects our sense of what needs to be done in the future. Let me start by talking about the **advanced economies** where, as is well known, the fiscal accounts are generally weaker, reflecting large increases in deficits and debt ratios since the start of the crisis in 2008. Most of these economies were planning to **tighten fiscal policy this year**, and the good news is that in the bulk of these adjustment looks to be solidly on track. Most advanced economies, especially **Canada and in Europe**, are making good progress in reducing their budget deficits. In some cases, such as **Germany and Italy**, they are even ahead of schedule. Given the evidence that the recovery in Europe has strengthened, these countries should continue with their fiscal adjustment plans. Of course, the situation in some countries in Europe remains difficult, as reflected in rising financial market spreads in **Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, as well as Cyprus**. In Greece and Portugal, in particular, downward revisions to growth and other factors have implied the need for additional cutbacks. **Some good news** In the **United States**, **recent fiscal news is good: strong revenue growth and a slower pace of expenditure means that the deficit will actually fall slightly this year, rather than increasing as expected. **This means that the amount of fiscal adjustment that will be required to achieve the 2012 deficit target is smaller, and less likely to be detrimental to growth. **What remains missing in the United States is political consensus** on the tools and targets to bring down debt and deficits, as part of a credible medium-term adjustment plan with objectives endorsed by Congress. Without such a plan, yield on U.S. government paper would sooner or later start reflecting a risk premium, which would not be good for the United States and the world economy. The exceptions to the positive recent developments are in the Pacific: **Japan, Australia, and New Zealand;** all countries that were affected by serious natural disasters. The case of Japan is particularly noteworthy: a supplementary budget of about \u00c2\u00be percent of GDP enacted after the tsunami was already reflected in the April issue of the [Fiscal Monitor. A further supplementary budget is now expected that will increase spending next year by about 1 percent of GDP. As a result, Japan will have the largest fiscal deficit among all major advanced economies this year and next. This further weakening of the fiscal accounts makes the definition of a clear and detailed medium-term fiscal adjustment path even more urgent. Many **emerging economies are experiencing rapid growth,** in some cases fuelled by favorable strong capital inflows that are boosting asset prices, and by high commodity prices. Some of these economies are making very good progress in tightening fiscal policy. However, some emerging economies still have sizable deficits, especially **India, but also Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil**; even though our sense is that these economies are operating at very close to full capacity. Indeed, in 2012 one would like to see more tightening to reduce the risk of overheating in all four of these countries. **Developments in Latin America** **As I was in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, there was a great deal of interest in developments in the region**. There is certainly much to be pleased about how [Latin America has weathered the global financial storm. A great deal has been done, for example, by strengthening fiscal institutions and improving the structure of public debt. As a result, contagion from the crisis in the advanced economies was minimal, which is a welcome change from the past. Nevertheless, it is important to sound a note of caution: as detailed in the [Fiscal Monitor, the overall deficit for Latin America remains higher than in the mid-1990s and is not much different from its historical average. **Public debt ratios in Latin America** remain above those in emerging Asia and emerging Europe. Many countries in Latin America will also face significant spending pressures in the future as infrastructural spending has been cut excessively over time and health care and pension spending are expected to rise. This means that considerable additional work will be required to strengthen fiscal sustainability and lay a solid foundation for the future.

In common with many of its peers in **Latin America**, Brazil is recovering strongly from the crisis. But new financial stability challenges are emerging in this, and other fast-growing regions. Let me start with **three** key messages: * First, **financial risks have increased since April. ** * Second, as a result, policymakers in both advanced and emerging economies need to step up their efforts to preserve financial stability and safeguard the recovery. * And third, we have entered into **a new phase of the crisis - a political phase**- **when tough political decisions will need to be made**, because the window for substantial policy action is closing. Time is of the essence. Let me delve into the **details of the increased financial stability risks**, which have kept policymakers and investors, on the edge of their seats. **First, a string of negative surprises in recent economic data **is prompting investors to reassess the sustainability of the economic recovery. While a global recovery remains the most likely scenario, downside risks to this forecast have increased. Any weakening in the economic outlook will threaten to stall'and possibly reverse'improvements in the balance sheets of banks and households. ** Second, there are** **increasing concerns about the political resolve to support the adjustment efforts in Europe**. The lack of a comprehensive solution to this problem has led to increased financial market pressures on some European governments, and has rekindled worries about potential **contagion** within and beyond Europe. In the **United States**, there are increased financial market concerns, due to the continuing political stalemate over the debt ceiling and the longer- tern fiscal path. And **Japan's **medium-term fiscal adjustment targets may have become even more challenging because of the impact of the recent earthquake and tsunami. **And third, we are concerned about the effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates.** Accommodative monetary policies remain necessary in advanced economies, partly because of the limited progress in resolving structural problems.**_ _**But a** **prolonged period of low interest rates may lead investors to underestimate risk in their** search for yield.** This could promote the buildup of financial imbalances. **We have noticed two trends****** * The declining cost of debt is prompting some companies and investors to rediscover their **appetite for financial leverage**. There is evidence of such re-leveraging in the market for corporate high-yield bonds and leveraged loans * **Investors' search for yield has also spurred strong capital inflows into some key emerging markets,** although such flows have recently eased. For example, buoyant foreign demand has led to a recent surge in international corporate bond issuance, notably from **Latin America**, and a decline in corporate bond yields. **Policy priorities** Given these risks, policymakers need to increase their efforts to tackle longstanding financial challenges once and for all. **In Europe, there is a need to finally cut the Gordian knot of mutually reinforcing financial exposures between banks and governments**, which has fuelled worries about potential contagion. **To reduce the contagion risk, policymakers **need to follow a **two-pronged approach**'(i) push for a comprehensive plan to repair the financial system and (ii) reduce sovereign risk through credible medium-term fiscal consolidation. 1. **Financial System.** So far, there has been **insufficient progress **in strengthening bank funding and capital positions in some European Union countries. The forthcoming **stress tests by the European Banking Authority** will be a decisive opportunity to enhance transparency and address the weak tail of undercapitalized banks. 2. **Governments.** Political resolve is required to address **medium-term fiscal adjustment** needs in several advanced countries, including the** United States and Japan**, which have yet to take decisive action in this area. In short, when it comes to financial systems and governments, **advanced economies** need an **orderly de-leveraging, which means they would cut back on the amount they borrow**. By contrast, **emerging economies** need to focus on **orderly re- leveraging**. * They should do so by **guarding against** **overheating** and the buildup of financial imbalances'with strong credit growth, rising inflation, and surging capital inflows. * **Corporate leverage** is also rising, and weaker firms are now accessing international capital markets. This could make corporate balance sheets more vulnerable to external shocks. * With **strong domestic demand pressures**'especially in emerging **Asia and** **Latin America**'macroeconomic measures are needed to avoid overheating, accumulating financial risks, and undermining policy credibility. * **Macroprudential tools, such as higher reserve requirements, **and, in some cases, a **limited use of capital controls**, can play a supportive role in managing capital flows and their effects. However, they cannot substitute for appropriate macroeconomic policies. Policymakers continue to face **potentially large future shocks** to the financial system, at a time when its resilience is not yet assured. And there is **less room for maneuver **to counter these shocks through traditional fiscal and monetary policies. Moreover, in **increasingly gridlocked political systems**, policymakers may find it progressively harder to take substantial policy action** to address sovereign and financial risks**. We are now in a new phase of the crisis - the political phase - and tough political decisions need to be made. Time is of the essence.

While it is too early to tell, we see this as a bump in the road rather than something more worrisome. Special factors, in particular the effect of oil prices on disposable income, appear to have played an important role. But, assuming oil prices stay broadly stable, in line with financial markets' expectations, spending by consumers and firms should remain steady in what is, admittedly, a weak recovery. **Brakes to growth** **are still very much present in advanced countries**. Fiscal consolidation is needed, but weighs on demand in most countries. Continuing weaknesses in the financial system, in particular undercapitalized banks, are slowing down lending. By contrast, many emerging market countries face the risk of overheating. While they are tightening policy, many of them will need to do more. **Risks to the recovery are clear, and more to the downside than 3 months ago. I shall focus on three such risks. ** * **The first and obvious one comes from Europe.** In the best of cases, improving competitiveness and returning to fiscal health in some of these countries will be a long and painful process. It will require strong policies, namely fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, and policies which protect the most vulnerable. It will also require help and outside financing, official and private. These countries cannot do it alone. The stakes are very high: failure to commit to and implement policies, or failure to deliver on financing, hold the risk of triggering disorderly financial and sovereign defaults. Contagion through various channels to the rest of Europe then holds the risk of derailing the European recovery and perhaps even the world recovery. * **The second risk is on the fiscal side**, and affects a large number of advanced countries. Many countries, including the United States, are yet to put in place a convincing medium term fiscal consolidation plan. Such a lack of adjustment leads markets to worry. Worries lead to higher risk premia, increasing the cost of borrowing not only for the sovereign but also for private borrowers. Or they force countries into precipitated fiscal adjustments, leading also to sharp decreases in demand. In both cases, growth may be derailed. * **The third risk concerns emerging market economies**. The difference between a strong and an overheating economy is often difficult to tell in real time, but there are reasons to think that a number of emerging countries may be close to crossing the line. Inflation is increasing beyond what can be explained by commodity and food prices. Credit growth rates and some asset prices are starting to look high relative to historical standards. Some economies, with both strong domestic demand and strong capital inflows, face difficult policy choices. Some countries, in particular in Asia, should allow for further appreciation of their currency and a reduction of their current account surplus. Others, in particular in Latin America, have already allowed for a substantial appreciation, and their adjustment must take place at other margins. All must use the right combination of instruments at their disposal, fiscal, monetary, and macro prudential, to slow their economies in time and avoid costly boom-bust cycles. So the global recovery continues. But the road to health is still a long one. And it is surely no time to relax.

This is especially so in the **Arab world**, which is home to some of the largest food importers and where **rising food prices** have been one of the factors in recent political unrest. In the context of ongoing political developments, governments across the region are responding to the rise in commodity prices with hikes in fuel and food subsidies, civil service wage and pension increases, additional cash transfers, tax reductions, and other spending increases. These measures will help poor households maintain their purchasing power and limit further increases in domestic food prices. How should central banks'whose task is to prevent general price increases that would further cut into peoples' incomes'react? What inflation metric should they target? **Looking beneath the headlines** Economists often divide inflation numbers into **headline** inflation and **core** inflation. * **_Headline inflation_** measures how the overall consumer price index is faring. This index reflects the cost of purchasing a typical basket of household items, ranging from food to clothing to rent. The headline number can be influenced by seasonal factors, e.g. food prices can ease at harvest time. And, it can also reflect changes in individual volatile items, such as food and energy prices. * **_Core inflation,_** on the other hand, attempts to give an idea of underlying inflation trends by excluding products that are prone to temporary price shocks. Typically this means excluding food and fuel items from the overall consumer price index. That's why, in any given month, core inflation can differ from headline inflation. However, over the medium term, core and headline inflation rates generally converge. Core inflation has been the yardstick by which many central banks'especially in advanced economies where the weight of food and fuel in consumption baskets is relatively small'make policy decisions. The idea is to keep the focus on longer-term trends to help avoid too-frequent changes in monetary policy and interest rates in response to temporary inflation shocks. Across the Middle East and North Africa, headline inflation has accelerated over the last year, driven mainly'as in other parts of the world'by rising international commodity prices. * Food and fuel account for about half of the items included in the typical consumption baskets of the region. * Moreover, food price inflation is higher, more volatile, and more persistent than nonfood inflation. Core inflation in the region has exhibited a more modest upward trend than headline inflation over the last 12 months. **Getting an accurate picture** So, where food and fuel comprise such a large share in the consumption basket, a focus on movements in core inflation can provide a distorted picture of overall inflation trends in an economy. This can have the undesirable effect of underestimating inflation pressures, delaying needed monetary policy responses, and thereby increasing peoples' future inflation expectations. Indeed, there are indications that food and fuel inflation are spilling over into core inflation by raising inflation expectations and boosting workers' demands for higher wages. For example, we calculate that in the Middle East and North Africa, about half of a shock to food inflation in any given quarter is transmitted to nonfood inflation in the following quarter of the year. The upshot? Regional central banks cannot afford to cast aside headline inflation and focus only on core inflation when setting policy rates and the overall stance of monetary policy. They will need to focus on both in order to have a good sense of inflation developments, allowing them to be ready to react and contain inflation pressures as needed.

Organized jointly by the Brazilian authorities and the IMF, the conference brought together experts from both the demand and supply sides of the issue, including many with a wealth of hands-on experience. The discussion was rich and informative. Clearly we still have a lot to learn about the optimal approach to managing capital flows, about the right policy tools, and the right combination of tools. To start with two general, but important observations. First, while the issue of **capital controls** **is fraught with ideological overtones**, it is fundamentally a technical one, indeed a highly technical one. Put simply, governments have five tools to adjust to capital flows: monetary policy, fiscal policy, foreign exchange intervention, prudential tools, and capital controls. The challenge is to find, for each case, the right combination. [This is not easy. Second, we need to better **understand the costs and benefits of capital flows**. The costs depend'more than is generally understood'on the institutional framework in each country: things like the exchange rate regime, the degree of dollarization of the economy, and the credibility of the central bank. Even costs related to '[Dutch Disease''the bogeyman still much in the minds of policy-makers'are in fact not well established. Over the past 18 months, we at the IMF have done some rethinking about the nature of the risks capital flows may bring, and how best to respond. The most recent [research attempts to develop a conceptual framework to weigh the benefits of different policy responses, including capital controls. Like the [re-examination of many economic principles in the wake of the global crisis, this work is just the beginning of a conversation. The Rio conference highlighted the importance of consulting and debating the issues more broadly, particularly with financial sector experts who understand and influence intermediation, but also with academics and outside researchers. The conference gave me a better appreciation of the universe of issues, and of the outreach and research still to do. I took 32 pages of notes during the conference; I will not impose them on you, but here are some highlights. On the nature of flows'\u00a6 * Looking at the relevant set of investors suggests higher flows to emerging markets are here to stay. This is the 'new normal'\u009d, and is based on a '[fundamental re-rating of global risk'\u009d in favor of emerging market assets with better fundamentals and higher returns. But, it remains to be seen whether, for example, the new appetite of foreign investors for local currency debt comes from a durable shift in demand, or the more temporary expectation of appreciation. * The nature of specific investors must inform the policy choices. We often think of inflows and outflows as coming from primarily from decisions by foreign investors. The reality is that many of these inflows and outflows often come from decisions by [domestic investors. When this is the case, targeting nonresidents is largely misguided. On the policy options'\u00a6 * None of the tools'be they reserve accumulation, prudential measures, or capital controls'are [water-tight. So we should move away from strict policy orderings toward a more fluid approach of using 'many or most of the tools most of the time'\u009d instead of 'this now, that later'\u009d. * It is not clear that the diversity of approaches we observe in practice comes from different circumstances, or from suboptimal responses. It was interesting to observe for example that Chile relies on foreign exchange intervention, not on capital controls, but India, instead, relies on capital controls, not on foreign exchange intervention. Are these corner solutions really optimal? There were many other important technical issues beyond these and I'd encourage you to read some of the interesting presentations by the participants and speakers, including remarks by Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, on the [Rio conference website. There were some issues that I would like to have seen explored more fully. One was the multilateral angle. As my IMF colleague Min Zhu said in his [opening remarks, 'ensuring that countries reap the full benefits of capital flows is a shared responsibility between advanced and emerging market economies, between surplus and deficit countries, between capital-exporters and capital-importers.\" The challenge is to translate this into practice. What is the actual responsibility of source countries? Should they take it into account in conducting monetary policy, and if so, how? Should we worry about the 'beggar thy neighbor'\u009d effect of controls? Some of the evidence presented at the conference suggested that these spillovers across recipient countries were not very large. Theoretical and further empirical work is badly needed here. Nor did we have an opportunity to revisit, or even discuss, the current wisdom on capital account openness. In light of new research, what should we be telling policy-makers, those with mostly open and those with mostly closed capital accounts? Should Chile and China eventually converge to the same point along the continuum? And, if so, at what rate? We cannot avoid coming to views on this fundamental issue. Overall, our discussions in Rio were a positive step toward a more constructive, updated approach, away from the contentious legacy of the capital controls debate. We look forward to continuing the conversation as we work with members to find a way toward the right combination of policies.

But, perhaps, not in the way we had previously anticipated. [Twelve months ago our policy antennae were keenly attuned to the risks posed by the foreign capital that flooded into Asia from mid-2009 onwards. What was remarkable about this was the speed of the rebound after the massive drop during the global financial crisis. Within just 5 quarters, net inflows rose from their early 2009 trough to their mid-2010 peak'a mere one- fifth of the time that typically elapsed between troughs and peaks in the cycle of capital flows during the pre-Asian crisis period. Another twelve months on, what we're seeing is not really all that 'exceptional'\u009d'a point often overlooked in the current debate on capital inflows to emerging markets. In our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook_, we put the current situation into historical perspective. Our analysis confirms that, with the recent surge, net overall capital flows to emerging Asia (as a share of GDP) have not surpassed the peaks reached in past episodes of large inflows to the region. Also, it is reassuring that signs of risks from asset valuations and corporate indicators remain largely muted, and that external buffers are large. Of course, that's not to say it's all blue skies. The nature of inflows is different this time, and that poses new challenges and risks. Net portfolio flows'bonds and equity'are now dominating inflows to Asia. And, for a few economies in the region'including India, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Thailand'those inflows are large compared to what their domestic markets can absorb. And, despite the slowdown since late 2010, portfolio inflows to emerging Asia are expected to continue over the next two years. The earlier rapid surge and continued concentration in potentially volatile portfolio flows raise concerns for a few Asian economies. Given the relatively shallow markets in some countries, asset price bubbles can form quickly and sudden stops remain a real possibility. This poses risks to financial stability and asset market imbalances, particularly in a context where there are already isolated pockets of concern on [overheating, such as credit dynamics in some countries and certain segments of property markets around the region. Given that large capital flows are seen to complicate the conduct of monetary policy, and the added risks to financial stability, how then should policymakers in the region proceed? ### **Monetary policy effectiveness** Capital flows can affect the monetary transmission mechanism as they can depress long term bond yields, which tend to be driven mainly by global factors. This in turn means that central banks have relatively limited influence on long-term interest rates. Despite the important role of long-term interest rates in monetary transmission in other parts of the work, [our analysis find that monetary policy in Asia has a strong influence on economic activity, working mostly through short-term interest rates. Indeed, a bulk of bank loans to businesses and mortgages in the region are priced relative to short-term interest rates. So, when capital inflows are large, conventional monetary policy still has a role to play in countering overheating pressures. ### **Safeguarding financial stability** But, macroeconomic stability is not sufficient to guard against the risk of financial instability'a point underscored by the global financial crisis. The upshot has been increased attention of the role of [macroprudential measures, as have been introduced by several economies in Asia. These measures aim to reduce the risk of overheating in asset prices and of subsequent busts if capital flows reverse. [We find that macroprudential measures can play a useful role in reducing economic and financial instability that could arise from surges in capital inflows. Changes in both policy rates and macroprudential measures are likely to affect economic activity, as well as financial conditions. However, macroprudential measures differ in some key respects. For example, changes in policy rates are 'blunt'\u009d instruments that impact all lending activities, whereas macroprudential measures are aimed specifically at markets in which there is an excessive risk of financial instability. Accordingly, the two instruments are best seen as complements to, and not substitutes for, one another. ### **Better together** Asia's economies are now well placed'and have the necessary 'space''to tackle overheating concerns with appropriate macroeconomic policies. But that will not be enough to limit leverage and address financial stability risks. Policymakers should be ready to tighten monetary policy together with, but not in place of, macroprudential measures.

When you are inside the Fund, what is really striking is how active the internal debate is,'\u009d she says. At a time when the global economy is being buffeted by continued uncertainty in Europe, uprisings in the Middle East, and signs of overheating in some emerging market economies, there's a lot to discuss. And, in addition to global economic problems, the IMF's work environment has come under increased scrutiny, in particular how women are treated and its professional code of conduct. In an interview, Ms. Shafik discusses some of these issues, including what is being done to promote [diversity.

Bailouts are expensive. For countries that used public funds, estimated costs of direct support in the recent crisis reached on average about 7 percent of GDP. **We've been looking at how to fix the too important to fail problem for a number of reasons.** The big picture matters; the stability of the financial system, avoiding crises, and the hardships that accompany. **Most importantly, to spare taxpayers the expense of bailouts, and also to reinstate market discipline, eliminate moral hazard, and level the playing field.** These institutions also need to be easier to manage, supervise and resolve if they do fail. **[Our research shows that addressing the size of banks cannot solve the problem. Size alone doesn't capture the full dimension of the issue.** The growing complexity and connections to other institutions and financial markets, and the lack of substitutes providing similar services magnify the propensity to trigger panics. These traits make such institutions 'too important to fail'\u009d rather than 'too big to fail.'\u009d **We favor market based measures to help reduce the likelihood and impact of a failure**, including * stricter capital requirements * more intensive supervision in line with an institution's contribution to systemic risk * increased disclosure of their structure, exposures, and activities * effective resolution regimes that allow creditors to share any losses. **The problem isn't getting any smaller** **Institutions that were more interconnected appear to have had a higher likelihood of distress during the recent crisis than other financial institutions.** The size of an institution relative to its home country economy or its financial system played a key role in authorities' decisions about whether to bail it out in the event of distress. **The too-important-to-fail institutions have grown in importance.** Their share of assets doubled during 2000-09, reaching a quarter of the total global assets. The growth of their assets, ranging from $50 billion to $3 trillion, in some cases outpaced the growth of their national economies. **The implicit or explicit government backing gave such institutions funding advantage:** for example, the largest banks in the United States have been able to borrow funds at lower rates than smaller banks, and this advantage widened after the crisis to about 80 basis points. **Time will tell** **Global regulators have come up with a new set of tighter rules for all banks, known as [Basel III, as a starting point to make the system less risky and address a number of regulatory issues.** Countries have until 2018 to comply with the new rules. A series of policy measures targeted specifically at systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs for shorthand, have been put forward, including by the Financial Stability Board. We support these measures that serve to internalize the risks SIFIs take. Specifically: * stricter capital requirements designed to limit contribution to systemic risk, * more intensive supervision of financial institutions in line with their complexity and risks, * enhanced disclosure requirements on SIFIs' activities, exposures and structures, * effective resolution regimes nationally and globally. **Implementation may take several years, however, while systemic institutions continue to grow in size and complexity, and may resume their risky practices. So in the interim, we'd like to see rapid, credible, and visible actions.** This would require systemically important financial institutions to hold more loss-absorbing capital above what is required under Basel III, accompanied with intensive and proactive supervision of the regulated entities and efforts to limit regulatory arbitrage within and across borders and sectors. **Given the financial system is not out of the woods yet, one could worry that the next failure of a systemically important institution could again prompt a government funded rescue at a time when government finances are fragile in many countries.** This is a very good reason to implement interim measures to signal that the world is united to deal with the problem.

Sayeh (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais) Sub-Saharan Africa's 'frontier markets'\u009d'the likes of Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, and Zambia'were seemingly the destination of choice for an increasing amount of capital flows before the global financial crisis. Improving economic prospects in these countries was a big factor, but frankly, so too was a global economy awash with liquidity. Then the crisis hit. And capital'particularly in the form of portfolio flows'was quick to flee these countries as was the case for so many other economies. Fast forward to 2011. Capital flows are coming back to the frontier, but in dribs and drabs. ### **Learning from experience** In our recent [Regional Economic Outlook we examined the experience of sub-Saharan Africa's frontier markets, with a view to understanding how they can best make use of these inflow to meet their own development and growth objectives. [Contrary to popular perceptions, bilateral donors and international financial institutions are no longer the main source of funding (including capital flows and transfers) for investment and growth. Most of the six-fold increase in inflows since 2000 came from the private sector'a sharp departure from the previous decade. And this was true for countries other than South Africa and Nigeria, the two largest countries that typically account for 50'60 percent of these flows. But, then when the crisis hit, the sharp withdrawal of capital from almost all the frontier markets was most evident for fixed-income investments (such as treasury securities) and equities. And, now, with the increasing attention of investment bank publications on sub-Saharan Africa following the global crisis, some might suggest that investors are putting their money where their mouth is. ### **But are the good times rolling again? Not so fast'\u00a6** The evidence so far is rather mixed. Private investors, possibly smarting from financial losses a few years ago, have not rushed in like lemmings. They seem more discerning now, looking more closely at country-specific circumstances. For instance, portfolio flows have picked up in a few of the frontier markets such as Ghana and Mauritius, and, to a lesser degree, Zambia, but have remained flat in most of the other countries. The sharp decline in yields following monetary policy easing in frontier markets in the wake of the crisis has curbed the appetite of most fixed-income investors in countries such as Kenya and Uganda. That said, foreign direct investment and other equity investment were not hit too badly during the crisis, and seem to be recovering nicely in most countries. Bank credit lines have fully recovered, except for Nigeria, where the vestiges of a domestic banking crisis are still lingering. ### **Macroeconomic management challenges** The increasing reliance on private external financing poses challenges for macroeconomic management, given the relative size and volatility of these flows. * First, although net private capital inflows to sub-Saharan Africa constitute only about one tenth of total net private flows to emerging and developing countries, the inflows are large relative to the economic size of the recipient countries. * Second, the more volatile flows have the potential to cause considerable difficulties in monetary management in sub-Saharan Africa, given shallow financial markets. For instance, in proportion to reserve money, nonresident holdings of government securities have swung from almost nothing to more than 40 percent in some countries. So what can countries do to manage large inflows should they resume? The IMF has recently developed a [framework to help countries manage large capital inflows. The [main message is that, while there is no substitute for implementing appropriate macroeconomic policies, countries can choose from a menu of policy options to respond to capital inflows. For example, tightening fiscal policy can reduce inflows that may be attracted to high yields resulting from high fiscal deficits. However, in some cases, it may also be appropriate to consider taxes, certain prudential measures, and capital controls. To sum up, except for a few countries, the volume of capital inflows in sub- Saharan Africa's frontier markets has yet to return to the heydays of 2006-08. So the primary interest of most policymakers in the region is how to further induce stable and beneficial private flows'which now exceed official flows'to support investment and growth. But they should stand ready in case sharply rising inflows give rise to macroeconomic management problems.

One question that arises is: What role can the financial sector play? It is well known that a dynamic and vibrant financial sector will improve economic outcomes for a country, leading to faster and more equitable economic growth. The key to answering this question, therefore, is to look to the past and examine how the financial sector has contributed historically to growth in the region. Unfortunately, the experience in the Middle East and North Africa has not been as successful as in other regions. Although the overall scale of activity by banks and stock markets in the region'known by economists as _financial depth_'has been similar to the global emerging and developing country average, there are two important differences: * **The region's financial sectors vary greatly from country to country.** For example, in 2008, the country with the deepest banking sector (Jordan) provided credit to the economy at a scale equivalent to 16 times that of the shallowest (Libya). Countries such as Saudi Arabia exhibit levels of stock market activity similar to those in developed countries, while others lack a stock market altogether (Yemen). * **Banking systems in many Middle East and North African countries should be providing greater amounts of credit, given their ability to attract deposits.** Excluding the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the average loan'deposit ratio in regional banking systems has been well below the global emerging and developing country average for the past 30 years. More crucially, for a given level of depth, banks in the region have not delivered benefits to the same degree as elsewhere. Access to financial services has fallen short, according to surveys. Relative to other regions, fewer firms receive bank financing, a greater proportion cite access to credit as a major constraint to their business plans, and a smaller percentage of the population has access to checking accounts or ATMs. Bank loans tend to be concentrated among a small number of borrowers, excluding many potentially growth-enhancing firms. So, it is not surprising that the impact of banking depth on growth in the Middle East and North Africa is at least a third lower than in other emerging and developing countries, according to a worldwide analysis. If Yemen's banking system were to deepen to the emerging and developing country average, for example, annual per capita growth would increase by just 1\u00c2? percentage points. By contrast, a country'say, Armenia'with a similarly shallow banking system in another region would accelerate its growth rate by a full 2' percentage points. Thus, in addition to financial shallowness in some Middle Eastern countries, the region as a whole seems to suffer from a _quality gap_ in bank intermediation with respect to the rest of the world. **Enhancing growth** How, then, can policymakers in the region enhance the financial system's contribution to growth? In countries where shallowness in the banking sector or domestic stock and bond markets continues to be an issue, they could take steps to * improve the conditions under which banks, households, investors, and firms participate in financial transactions; * improve legal frameworks that protect creditor and shareholder rights; * streamline insolvency regimes; * develop primary and secondary markets for government securities; and * remove excessive controls on credit and/or interest rates. * Continued macroeconomic stability would also help, by increasing the public's willingness to place funds in bank deposits or in domestic capital markets. To address the quality gap, policymakers will have to boost competition in the banking sector. Actions to remove entry barriers and improve the credit information environment, in addition to promoting the development of local debt markets, would go a long way toward accomplishing this. Policymakers should also assess'and possibly scale back'the role of state banks in countries where their large presence may be stifling both financial depth and banking competition.

But, **there are also now growing signs of price pressure across the region's goods and asset markets.** Headline inflation in Asia has accelerated since October 2010, mainly owing to higher commodity prices. There are, of course, variations in how much this has affected inflation across Asia, partly reflecting differences in the shares of food and energy items in expenditures. **But there are signs that higher commodity prices are spilling over to a more generalized increase in inflation.** Expectations of future inflation have picked up. And accommodative macroeconomic policy stances, coupled with limited slack in some economies, have added to inflation pressures. **So, is Asia overheating? While inflation is generally expected to decelerate moderately in 2012, after first increasing further in 2011, inflation risks remain on the upside.** Low inventories and limited scope for supply to respond to higher demand mean that commodity prices are vulnerable to new supply shocks. In addition, persistent concerns about food shortages could trigger an upward spiral in global prices. __ **At the same time, overheating pressures are building within a few Asian asset markets._ _**There are two telltale signs. * Equity and bond markets seem to be in line with past norms, as indicated by their valuations and yields relative to historical trends, but credit growth has accelerated in recent months. * Property prices appear relatively buoyant in some cases, particularly in certain segments of the market in China, Hong Kong SAR, and Singapore. Against this backdrop, **the need for policy tightening in Asia has become more pressing than it was six months ago, especially in economies that face generalized inflation pressures.** How should policymakers address these challenges? * In addition to higher policy rates, exchange rate appreciation would help thwart overheating pressures by making overall monetary conditions tighter. * While capital inflows tend to complicate the task of policy tightening and this remains an issue in a few countries, such flows have moderated in recent months in many countries. * The run-up of inflows in 2010 in many countries also raised concerns about how to handle a 'sudden stop'\u009d or reversal of capital flows. In this context, [macroprudential measures could help complement the policy mix, particularly in terms of addressing overheating in asset markets. * More fiscal consolidation would also help reduce the burden to be borne by monetary tightening. At the same time, consolidation should allow for targeted social programs to cushion the impact of inflation on the most vulnerable groups, and also to maintain sufficient fiscal space for meeting longer-term investment needs in infrastructure and social sectors. As [I wrote about a couple of weeks ago, such spending is important for economic rebalancing and more inclusive growth. To conclude, we expect Asia to continue to be a key engine of global growth over the next two years. But with overheating pressures now in clear sight, policies need to be geared toward keeping these pressures from boiling over in a way that could undermine Asia's economic prospects and, therefore, the global economic outlook.

Take Lithuania, which grew an eye-catching 14.7 percent in the first quarter of 2011. But many other countries in the region are seeing strong growth as well. True, it will take a while before most crisis-hit countries will be able to reclaim the economic output that was lost as a result of the crisis. But things are definitely going in the right direction. Most encouragingly, the growth pattern is very different from that in the years leading up to the crisis. * **During the boom years, emerging Europe grew rapidly, but growth in many countries was unbalanced'real estate, construction, and banking boomed while manufacturing languished.** Capital inflows were large, but they boosted demand rather than supply, and led to a surge in imports, extremely high current account deficits'25 percent of GDP in Latvia and almost 30 percent of GDP in Bulgaria 'and overheating. * **Today, growth is driven by exports and manufacturing.** Take Estonia, where exports of goods in the fourth quarter of 2010 were 52 percent higher than a year earlier. The old growth engines are spluttering, but others have kicked into gear. And it is not just exports anymore'the recovery is broadening to include investment and even consumption. In 2011, domestic demand is set to become the main growth engine in emerging Europe. What has caused the shift? The answer is both markets and policies. * **Markets at work.** During the boom years, real estate, construction, and finance were very profitable'much more so than manufacturing. But profits were artificially inflated by asset price bubbles and the under-pricing of risk. Now that profits have evaporated, investors are moving into other sectors. The adjustment is underpinned by improving competitiveness'the wage explosion of 2007-08 has given way to a decline in labor costs across the region. * **Policies have delivered.** Painful but determined fiscal adjustment put public finances back on track, which has led to a sharp reduction in risk. For instance, Latvia's credit default swap spread (which measures the cost of insuring debt against default) is 200 basis points today'down from 1100 basis points in 2009. Given this good news, what more can policymakers do to sustain the recovery'and prevent a new boom-bust cycle? Raising the long-term growth trend is key. * **Good structural policies can raise growth potential.** A big push to remove bottlenecks in energy, transportation, and communication would boost productivity. Here, funding from the European Union could be used to overcome the current lack of domestic resources. Efforts to upgrade the skills of the labor force would enable industry to climb the quality ladder. * **Good macroeconomic policies can prevent boom-bust cycles.** When the next boom takes off, policies should be much tighter. This will reduce the risk of overheating that pulls resources away from manufacturing and other traded goods into sectors where there is little competition, such as real estate and banking. When revenues are growing strongly, they should not be used to increase spending and public wages, as was done during the boom years. Instead, savings that can stimulate the economy during a downturn should be built up. This means that large, even very large, surpluses may be needed during boom years. Emerging Europe still has a lot of scope for catching up with advanced Europe. But catching-up is not a law of nature'without the right policies, countries can get stuck, as we have seen all too clearly with Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.

And he is right: the corporate tax code in the United States creates a significant bias toward debt finance over equity. Of course, the U.S. is not unique. In most of Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the world, the tax advantages of debt finance are even bigger than in the U.S. **The crux of the issue is that interest paid on borrowing can be deducted from the corporate tax bill, while returns paid on equity'dividends and capital gains'cannot.** The debt distortion is not new. What is new, however, is that **we have come to realize that excessive debt (or leverage) is much more costly than we have always thought.** The global financial crisis was a stark lesson that excessive leverage ratios in financial institutions can create massive spillover effects to the rest of the economy or even beyond national borders. **[Financial distortions have grown larger in recent years.** * Indeed, firms respond more aggressively to the tax bias of debt. For example, innovation in financial products has blurred the distinction between debt and equity, creating ample opportunities for tax avoidance. * And multinational firms are increasingly reallocating debt and equity between countries to exploit the most favorable tax environments, thus eroding corporate tax bases. Arguably, this matters more when the public purses in advanced economies are under added strain. It would actually make much more sense to tax-penalize debt than to tax-favor it. But that's not what corporate tax codes do. **A recent [_IMF Staff Discussion Note_ offers two alternatives to the current corporate tax code. In a nutshell, it will require either reducing the tax deductibility of interest or introducing similar deductions for equity returns.** Both reduce or eliminate the more favorable tax treatment of debt. **The first is to restrict or eliminate the deductibility of interest for corporate profits.** That would broaden the corporate tax base and free up revenue for reductions in the rate. Many advanced countries nowadays pursue such a policy of restrictions on interest deductibility. The problem with restrictions, rather than eliminating deductibility altogether, is that the rules become very complex and firms find their way around them. Added to that, these measures make investment more expensive and tend to hurt economic growth. That is not a desirable long-term prospect. **The alternative then is to allow a deduction for normal equity returns.** That is, a deduction for the value of returns on equity based on, say, the long-term government bond rate. The traditional allowance for interest deductions would remain, but the debt-equity playing field would be leveled. The flip side of eliminating incentives for excessive debt finance, is removing the bias against equity investments, with likely favorable implications for promoting investment, economic growth and job creation. Indeed, estimates suggest the reform can raise GDP by some 3 percent. Some countries'namely, Belgium, Brazil and Latvia'have had some success in this regard, moving toward such systems during the last decade. **The allowance for corporate equity deserves serious consideration from policymakers across the globe.** Some governments may be understandably reluctant to introduce an allowance that will narrow the corporate tax base in the short run. **But designing a better system will ultimately pay off.** * The loss of revenue can be kept to a minimum by granting the allowance only to new investment. * Improved tax design will make economies less vulnerable to future financial crises, and thus prevent enormous costs in terms of lost revenue. * And it could ultimately broaden corporate tax bases by eliminating the ample distortions the current systems create.

In fact, the real problem may have been that there was too _little_ financial integration. **Policies to promote deeper integration of Europe's banks'including through cross-border merger and acquisitions'should be part of the solution**. Further progress in strengthening the institutions of the European Union (EU) is also needed. In the run-up to the global crisis, countries in the euro area periphery, and countries in emerging Europe that had fixed their currency to the euro, had very high current account deficits. These deficits turned out to be dangerous: when the capital flows suddenly slowed, the result was a deep crisis. European financial integration, and in particular the introduction of the euro in 1999, likely facilitated these high current account deficits. Interest rates in Europe converged at low levels, as foreign exchange risk was eliminated within the euro area (and reduced in those countries that were on the road to euro area membership), and as confidence in macroeconomic stability increased. The result was a big boost to investment and reduced saving in countries that previously had been living with high interest rates. **Yet, as discussed in the IMF's **[**_Regional Economic Outlook_**** for Europe****, it would be wrong to conclude that the crisis was caused by too much financial integration.** The problem was not that capital flows were too large'it was that they were not used wisely. Capital flows boosted demand rather than supply, and imports rather than exports, and thereby contributed to large, and ultimately unsustainable, increases in external debt. Too many were oblivious of these risks'financial markets paid little attention until it was too late, and government policies did too little to address market failures. **The real problem may have been that there was too _little_ financial integration:** * **Although**** some ****elements of the financial system are highly integrated, ****cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the euro area are still limited.** As a result, banking flows to the euro area periphery during the boom years largely took the form of debt rather than equity, which exposed banks in the periphery to rollover risk. * **Europe has been integrated enough to foster large credit inflows, but not integrated enough to resolve crises quickly.** The European Union fostered financial integration by adopting a common currency in the euro area, but it did not put in place effective instruments to handle cross-border risks or mitigate the build-up of imbalances financed by cross-border financial flows. * **With banking problems addressed at the national rather than EU level, banking and sovereign problems in euro area periphery countries exacerbated each other.** Sovereign debt problems worsened as a result of the fiscal costs of banking problems, and concerns about the public sector increased the problems for the banking sector. How would more complete financial integration, together with pan-European institutions, have made it easier to resolve the crisis? * **Banking problems would have had fewer fiscal consequences.** If domestic markets had been more open to foreign bank ownership, national public sector policies for supporting and recapitalizing banks would not have been the only options. * **Banks would have suffered less spillover from sovereign debt problems**, as deposit guarantees and other implicit guarantees would not have depended on underwriting by the state. * **It would have been easier to consolidate the financial sector.** Consolidation is now occurring slowly, if at all, and often within borders. In many cases, restructuring has led to refocusing on the domestic market and sales of foreign operations, thus reducing financial integration. * **If a pan-EU supervisory regime had been in place, excessive exposures or expansions of banking systems might have been spotted, and ill-considered unilateral policy moves avoided. ** With all that said, financial integration alone is not enough to address the current crisis'ideally, the best solution will rely on restoring growth in the crisis-affected countries. Ultimately, economic growth depends on productivity, which some countries have struggled to raise over the past decade, despite ample access to foreign capital. **To boost sustainable growth, better policies are needed at the national level, while better governance at the EU level would help enforce such policies. **Further European economic integration would unlock substantial efficiency gains, in particular if it dismantled many obstacles to cross-border competition that still exist, in spite of all the efforts to build the single market. **To prevent future crises, we need more vigilance, both nationally and across borders, better institutions to deal with financial sector problems, and more, rather than less, financial and economic integration.** ", "index": 614}, {"pub": "5/11/2011", "title": "Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Supply Chain and Global Rebalancing", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3336", "content": " [By [Anoop Singh **Much of the debate over global rebalancing has focused on the U.S.-China trade imbalance.** But that's missing the bigger picture. **With the growth of cross-border supply chains'a signature feature of Asia's trade in recent decades'it would be misleading to focus on bilateral imbalances and exchange rates.** Instead of specializing in producing certain types of final goods, Asian exporters increasingly have specialized in certain stages of production and become vertically integrated with each other. So, as Asia's economies strive to rebalance their growth models, **we need to [understand better how the regional supply chain affects the way exchange rates and shifts in global demand work.** ### Illustrating the inputs Take, for example, the iPad and its rising popularity in the United States. According to [PC Magazine \"while final assembly is in China, most of the components seem to be actually manufactured in other Asian [economies],\" including Korea, Japan, and Taiwan Province of China. It would be misleading, in assessing imbalances, to focus solely on the end producer. The exporting country's price competitiveness depends on both the value of its own currency and also on the value of its suppliers' currencies. ### The shifting hub Some fast facts on the degree of regional trade integration give a sense of how important it is to account for exchange rates of both the exporting country and its suppliers. **The Asian supply network is increasingly centered on China.** * China now accounts'directly or indirectly'for about half of all imports of intermediate inputs within Asia, a share that has doubled since 1995. * For many of its Asian trading partners China has become the single most important destination of intermediate goods exports. * And China accounts for 20-25 percent of all capital goods exports from Japan and Korea, a fourfold increase from a decade earlier. * China's role as a supplier has also grown rapidly. It now accounts for nearly 30 percent of intermediate goods exports within Asia, up from 15 percent a decade earlier. **For all major Asian economies, Japan remains the second most important source of intermediate inputs after China.** And, in the short run, other countries may not be able to easily replace Japanese production of many high-end electronics and capital goods. If production disruptions in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami persist, say beyond the Fall, the resulting supply shortages could have significant spillovers to production elsewhere in Asia **Because of Asia's high degree of vertical integration, the cost of intermediate inputs can account for a significant share of exporters' total cost.** In value added terms, we estimate that the imported content in exports ranges from about 10 percent in Japan to 40 percent in the smaller open economies, such as Malaysia. **Taking account of the supply chain** A more comprehensive approach to thinking about imbalances and exchange rates might provide a clearer picture of what's required to achieve global rebalancing. **To account for importance of suppliers in cost competitiveness, [we estimate an 'integrated effective exchange rate.'\u009d** This builds on the concept of the conventional effective exchange rate, which measures changes in a country's exchange rate as a weighted average of the bilateral exchange rates with its trading partners. The integrated exchange rate also factors in supplier economies' exchange rate movements. * In the case of China, for example, the integrated exchange rate has appreciated more slowly than the conventional one in recent years. As the currencies of China's important supplier economies, in particular Korea, have depreciated, this has dampened the rise of input costs for Chinese exports. * Likewise, Korea's conventional effective exchange rate has depreciated by about 25 percent since the global financial crisis, but its integrated exchange rate has depreciated much less. In this case, the currencies of Korea's key suppliers, including Japan, have appreciated and raised the cost of inputs in Korea's exports. * By contrast, Japan's integrated exchange rate tracks more closely the conventional one, reflecting the relatively high local content in Japanese exports. **Accounting for vertical trade integration also affects the way we measure global demand imbalances.** For example, if we adjust the U.S.-China trade imbalance to reflect the original suppliers of the imported inputs in China's exports to the United States, we find that China's trade surplus to the U.S. shrinks and that of most other Asian economies increases. The bottom line? **Asia's high degree of vertical integration means that a durable reduction in imbalances requires adjustment across all major Asian economies and currencies.** ", "index": 615}, {"pub": "5/10/2011", "title": "Subsidies\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Love Them or Hate Them, It\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Better to Target Them", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3318", "content": " [By [Masood Ahmed (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?) **For decades, countries in the Middle East and North Africa have relied heavily on food and fuel price subsidies as a form of social protection. **And, understandably, governments have recently raised subsidies in response to hikes in global commodity prices and regional political developments. Like many things, there may be a time and a place for using subsidies.**But, they need to be better targeted. And, often, there will be better alternatives. Alternatives that do a better job of protecting the poor.** ### **High-cost endeavor** **Countries in the region stand out because of their heavy reliance on subsidies.** The region accounted for almost two-thirds of petroleum price subsidies worldwide in 2009, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency. Food subsidies are also widespread. **How much these subsidies cost is a bit of a guess, but [we estimate it was around $200 billion in 2010'equivalent to almost 8 percent of regional production.** About 15 percent of this reflected the cost of food subsidies, and the remainder subsidies on fuels and electricity. Subsidies may be popular, but they have drawbacks, and not just in terms of the substantial costs. In particular, subsidies: * Are **not cost-effective** or do not target those most in need; * **Encourage overconsumption** and waste, particularly for subsidized energy; * May lead to **damage to the environment**, inefficient investment choices, and competitiveness problems; * Can **strain public finances** and worsen debt levels; and * Encourage **socially wasteful activities**, such as smuggling and black-market dealings. For example, in the United Arab Emirates and Iran, energy consumption (adjusted for income differences) is more than 50 percent higher than in the United States. In Egypt, price subsidies have reportedly led to the use of bread as animal and fish feed. ### **Better as stop-gaps** **Price subsidies enjoyed by all are typically poorly targeted, so they are not the most cost-effective way to provide social protection. They really should be regarded as stop-gap measures.** Take the case of Jordan, where the poorest 40 percent of the population receives less than a quarter of total spending on fuel subsidies. **Attempts to phase out subsidy regimes have often proved challenging.** Some subsidy reforms, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, reduced outlays, but attempts were often reversed after meeting resistance (sometimes violent) or rolled back in the face of large commodity price swings. Some of the reasons why it's difficult are obvious. Subsidies often create vested interests and, in oil-producing countries, many consider cheap energy an entitlement. **Resistance to subsidy reform may also reflect'in part'broader weaknesses in public services.** In many countries, middle-income households are squeezed because they cannot rely on publicly-provided healthcare, schooling, or utilities. Whereas price subsidies are seen as one of few tangible benefits in return for tax payments, removing them is heavily resisted. **But, over the longer term, the objective should be to design and introduce more cost-effective social safety nets and replace price subsidies. ** Cash transfers and other forms of income support can be better targeted. Well- designed cash transfer systems can typically result in about 50'75 percent of spending reaching the bottom 40 percent of the population. And some better targeted measures can be expanded or introduced relatively quickly. Take, for example, school feeding programs, waiving fees for public services for the poor (such as health, education, or public transport), or labor-intensive public works. ### **Some success stories** Of course, none of this is easy. But, some countries have successfully introduced subsidy reforms.** ** * Outside the region, **Indonesia_ _**more than doubled fuel prices in 2005 and increased fuel product prices by 25'33 percent in 2008. The budgetary savings were used to finance a cash compensation program to 15.5 million poor families. * **Jordan** started reforms in 2005, gradually phased out fuel subsidies and, by February 2008, domestic fuel prices followed international prices via a monthly automatic pricing regime. Although automatic fuel adjustment was temporarily suspended in January of this year due to social pressures, a major factor in the reforms had been measures to ease the adjustment. This included, among others, cash transfers to low-income households and increased allocations to the National Aid Fund (the social assistance body). Both experiences illustrate the importance of putting in place effective social safety nets as part of price subsidy reforms to reduce the odds of reform reversal in case of sudden shocks. ### **Need for buy-in** **Better targeting subsidies or replacing them with more effective social safety nets is a complex process, both technically and politically.** But buy-in from the public is crucial to success. There are several ways to do this. [It's particularly important to: * Develop a **comprehensive communication strategy **and build political support. * Tell the public **how much subsidies really cost** and who benefits. * **Compensate those hardest hit**, by introducing or strengthening measures to protect the poor, including those that are living slightly above the poverty line. * Strengthen **public sector governance** and accountability. Net savings from subsidy reforms should be transparently allocated to high priority projects. * **Improve targeting gradually**._ _Narrowing the scope of existing subsidies'say, for products that are most important for the poor'can deliver quick gains. Ultimately, the goal should be to replace price subsidies by price-indexed cash transfers. * Automatic pricing mechanisms can help **depoliticize price setting**_. _ * **Move regionally, if possible**. A broader'even coordinated'regional effort to phase out subsidies and establish better social protection could also help ease resistance. The key point is that better targeting subsidies is as much about fairness as it is about value for money in public spending.

Most of these challenges and risks are not new, but they deserve renewed attention. In that spirit, **the IMF recently sponsored a **[**panel discussion**** to ****explore these issues,**** drawing on perspectives from LIC and BRIC ****policymakers,**** and development experts.** Strengthened ties have certainly boosted exports, helping to stimulate growth in LICs and contribute to their resilience during the global economic crisis. But, over the longer haul, what will matter is whether BRICs will be a positive force in making LICs more dynamic and productive through structural change'where economies shift from, say, agriculture to labor-intensive manufactures having a larger role. **So, the extent to which BRICs could be the building blocks for lasting growth in LICs may still be an open question. **But, we took away from the panel discussion six essential factors that will help LICs lay the groundwork to benefit from this important relationship. * **Current LIC-BRIC ties may pose a risk to LICs becoming too reliant on raw materials'a commodity trap'but LICs can also learn from successful BRICs.** * On one hand, India and China's competitiveness in manufacturing and their large demand for natural resources may push up the relative price of commodities undermining incentives for LICs to shift into manufacturing. * At the same time, Brazil and Russia (as well as advanced economies, such as Australia and Canada) have benefited from natural resources as a lynchpin for growth. * **Boosting manufacturing is central to stimulating growth. **Here too there are mixed views as to whether or not BRIC development financing has helped transfer technology and improved labor skills particularly in manufacturing. Greater provision of [trade preferences (including beyond commodities) could help ensure that the relationship is mutually beneficial and de-bunk the notion that BRICs are simply 'looting'\u009d the LICs for their natural resources. * **Concessional financing can provide a good jump start, but commercial financing will be vital to sustained growth.** BRIC development financing is complementary to traditional donor support, but can also have important knock-on effects. China's experience points to two possible advantages: commercially-oriented development financing is less constrained by the size of the flows, and provides incentives for competition, efficiency and permanent interest in ensuring that the project remains viable. * **LICs can learn from the BRICs in how they balance these various challenges.** Countries need a coherent strategy for [scaling up infrastructure and development that maximizes their growth potential. China, for instance, has had tremendous success in coherent investment planning, constantly reassessing infrastructure gaps and reorienting resources. * **Multilateral institutions and donors can play an important role in complementing the LIC-BRIC relationship, **through: analysis and policy advice to support macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability; and capacity building and facilitating improvements in the investment environment to boost LICs' absorptive capacity. * **Greater transparency of BRIC financing, particularly development financing, is needed**. Perhaps the biggest gap is the lack of official data on development financing by China'it would be helpful for China to publish this data.

Growth even exceeded 7 percent in the three Central Asia oil and gas exporters'Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. **The strong recovery should continue in 2011 and beyond, although at a somewhat slower pace'5 to 5\u00c2? percent over the medium term.** The global recovery and high growth in China and Russia will provide a boost, including through remittances and capital flows. The pickup of oil and gas production is expected to moderate in Kazakhstan and to reverse in Azerbaijan, the region's two largest economies. **This performance'detailed in our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia_'is impressive. But it falls short of the stunning rates of growth registered during the 2000s**. In the eight years before the global crisis, growth averaged a staggering 10.7 percent in the oil and gas exporting countries (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and 8.3 percent in the importing countries (Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan). ### **So why diversify?** **However, this pre-crisis growth was driven to a large extent by external factors.** * Strong growth in Russia and China, and favorable commodity prices'the oil and gas _importers_ are big _exporters_ of other commodities (cotton, copper, and gold, and molybdenum and tungsten!). * Remittances from Russia and other foreign inflows (FDI, bank borrowing) were key forces, particularly in driving consumer demand, construction, and real estate. Governments in the region entered the crisis with the space to respond aggressively by raising spending or cutting taxes, but as this stimulus wanes, growth will require other drivers. Unfortunately, most of the pre-crisis forces proved volatile or unsustainable, and commodity exports seem to have provided relatively few jobs. **Leaving their future growth prospects to the whims of these external factors once again seems a gamble**, especially as poverty remains high across the region, especially in Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. Income inequality, unemployment, and underemployment are a big concern, and a sizable youth population will enter the job market in large numbers in just a few years in some Central Asian countries. ### **The seventh pillar** **So back to those seven pillars for diversifying growth. Let's focus a bit on the last one: strengthening economic and financial ties within the region.** **Total trade among these countries is considerably lower than would be expected based on the size of the economies and their geographical proximity.** Only about 5 percent of their total exports or imports are destined for or come from other countries in the region. And this ratio has been declining. Most of the trade consists of agricultural commodities. There are good reasons for this. In the 20 years since independence, countries in the region have had to move away from the Soviet system'countries were highly specialized in producing a few commodities, and trade and financial flows. Integration was further complicated by frequent and severe shocks'most notably, the Russian financial crisis of 1998'and frictions and tense relations between some countries in the region. These disrupted trade and transportation links and hindered the development of labor, energy, and capital markets. But, there are some surprises. Despite most regional countries having substantially reduced tariff and nontariff barriers, intraregional trade is low. And, despite broadly shared institutions, language, and history, investment flows within the region are small, with just a few local banks or companies active in other countries in the region. **Remaining impediments are mostly institutional and reflect relatively poor business environments in much of the region, including lengthy and cumbersome export or import procedures.** Moving forward on each of the seven pillars will help reinforce efforts to address these impediments. **Improvements in governance and the business environment across the region would help attract investment both from within and outside the region.** And this should lead in turn to more trade and more jobs.

In particular, we sought to answer the following questions: * **How do Latin American countries intervene and in what respects do they differ from other economies? ** * **What are the rationales for these policies? ** * **How effective have they been in affecting the exchange rate? ** **[Most central banks in Latin America were actively involved in foreign exchange markets and, on average, about one third intervened on any given day, **a relatively high number considering most declare themselves to have a flexible exchange rate.

Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico were moderate interveners, whereas Peru and Uruguay (dollarized economies) and Brazil intervened more heavily. **In many cases, intervention has been accompanied by exchange rate appreciation. **This illustrates the difficulty of assessing the effects of intervention policies. For one thing, there is a two-fold cause-and-effect relationship between the intervention and the exchange rate: intervention affects the exchange rate, but the decision to intervene also depends on the exchange rate. For another, we do not know what might have happened to the exchange rate in the absence of intervention. ### How do countries intervene? **Knowledge of the manner in which central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets is limited.** This is partly due to a lack of information. However, we have attempted to fill in these information gaps by using various central bank publications, statements, and press releases to develop a qualitative database on intervention practices. **The reasons most often stated for intervening have been to build international reserve buffers and to contain exchange rate volatility.** Other reasons sometimes given for intervening tend to be vague. **[Central banks in one third of the countries we looked at have used some form of rule-based approach to intervention.** And that approach is more common in Latin America, although there are differences within the region. The central banks of Chile and Mexico always used rules when intervening. Colombia and Guatemala also relied on rules, while giving themselves room for discretionary purchases. Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay did not use rules. **The most commonly used market is the spot market, possibly reflecting a higher degree of liquidity vis-\u00c3 -vis other markets. As derivative markets have expanded over time, however, some central banks have increased the use of such instruments. **In the region, the Central Bank of Brazil is the main example, with operations in the forward and swap markets, while the Central Banks** **of** **Colombia and Mexico have used options. **Latin America is among the most transparent regions in terms of its operations, publishing better and more timely information.****** ### How effective is intervention? Our results do not detect an immediate impact of interventions on the rate of appreciation, but do find statistically significant effects on the _pace_ of appreciation: **on average, increasing interventions by 0.1 percent of GDP will produce'in one week and in comparison to a country that does not intervene'a 0.3 percent slowdown in the pace of appreciation.** Looking at the role of various intervention methods, we found that effectiveness is not dependent on the use of rules or discretionary frameworks, or on the degree of transparency. However, greater financial integration may significantly reduce the effectiveness of interventions. **In fact, intervention is more effective in Asia than in Latin America,** which is consistent with the differences in financial integration across the two regions. Furthermore, **interventions are most effective when there are signs of the currency being overvalued compared to its recent history**. This is especially noticeable in Latin America and highlights the importance of intervening 'when the time is right,'\u009d and never 'too early'\u009d. ### Conclusions ****Our analysis suggests that foreign exchange market interventions may help to mitigate appreciation _temporarily_. ****However, the impact depends on the circumstances and characteristics of each country. The degree of capital account openness and exchange rate misalignment are key factors. At the same time, we should not forget that foreign exchange intervention carries major quasi-fiscal costs and other nonfinancial costs. ** ** ", "index": 619}, {"pub": "5/3/2011", "title": "Confessions of a Dismal Scientist\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Africa\u2019s Resilience", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3184", "content": " [By [Abebe Aemro Selassie (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais) Like many economists, I tend to fear the worst.** I have witnessed phenomenal changes for the better in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 20 odd years.** Part of me still worries that this trajectory will not endure. But, the more I see of the [region's economic performance and outlook, the more I'm changing my tune. **Old anxieties set aside** Until my latest source for anxiety took hold a few months ago (more on this in a moment), I'd worried about the impact of the global financial crisis on sub- Saharan Africa. **The crisis hit just as many countries in the region were starting to enjoy a hard-earned period of economic growth, their best since at least the 1970s. I did not want this to be derailed by the crisis.** Previous global economic slowdowns were unkind to the region.** While other regions [tended to recover quickly, recoveries in sub-Saharan Africa tended to be more protracted, looking more U- or even L-shaped.** So, in the face of the worst period for the global economy in two-generations, what chance did the still fragile economies have? However, it soon became clear that this time would be different. And in fact, my initial fears were unfounded. **This time the region's recovery has been more V-shaped.** **Credit for that goes, in large part, to policymakers in the region. Good macroeconomic policies in many more countries the years before the crisis put them in good stead to weather the crisis relatively well.** This allowed them to adopt strong counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policies. And, looking ahead, the recovery to pre-crisis growth rates is well underway in most countries. **As we report in our latest [Regional Economic Outlook, output in sub-Saharan Africa looks set to expand by around 5\u00c2? this year and 6 percent in 2012.** To be sure, the crisis has caused considerable dislocation. The 1 million or so [jobs lost in South Africa are a case in point. Elsewhere, progress towards the poverty reduction [Millennium Development Goal has also been delayed. But it could also have been much worse. **In the face of the largest shock to the global economy, many sub-Saharan African countries have shown surprising resilience.** **Tackling worries** **My latest worry is the recent sharp increase in food and fuel prices on world markets.** When food prices spiked in 2008, there was a prompt and pronounced increase in local prices in most African countries. So far, this time, we have seen a more diverse picture. In a number of countries, strong harvests have helped in limiting increases in local food price. But, in many other countries, prices have started to increase sharply. This will be particularly harmful for the urban poor and landless rural households. **The surge in fuel prices will also test the resilience that the region has exhibited in recent years.** For the region's 37 oil importing countries, it will imply higher oil import costs, and higher fiscal deficits where the pass-through of international price to domestic price is delayed. And, across the region, it will imply higher inflation. **To help minimize the dislocation that this shock may entail, countries should consider a two-pronged policy response.** * **Wherever food price increases are pronounced, governments should consider targeted intervention**s'providing the poorest families with transfers from the budget or, less directly, by subsidizing food items they consume. * **In the case of fuel prices, however, we recommend that local prices should adjust in line with international prices.** Fuel price subsidies tend to be highly regressive'the bulk of the benefits go to the richest households'and very costly. So, once again, I might fear the worst. But, witnessing how countries handled the global financial crisis gives me hope'hope that the appropriate policies will be adopted and will be as effective this time too. And that gives this dismal scientist cause for optimism.

In other words, it has _doubled_ in size every decade.** This success has been based in large part on outward oriented growth strategies'giving market forces greater play and encouraging the production of tradable goods have been common themes. China's 'reform and opening up'\u009d policy, launched in 1978, is perhaps the most prominent example. **Over time, however, awareness has grown that export-led growth needs to be balanced by a second engine of growth.** * Heavy reliance on exports has contributed to a sharp rise in external current account surpluses in recent years from broadly balanced positions in the 1980s and 1990s. * And the global financial crisis has underscored the urgency of this transformation, reminding us that outward oriented growth has left Asia vulnerable to swings in global demand. **Stronger domestic demand, and in particular private domestic demand, is the second engine of growth that would help to address these imbalances and reduce undue reliance on external demand.** **How then to raise domestic demand? ** **First of all, rebalancing will mean different things for different countries as the reasons for relatively weak domestic demand vary across the region.** In China, low private consumption as a share of GDP is a major factor, but in other economies it is private investment that has been low since the late 1990s. Therefore, policies will also need to differ across countries. An important issue is financial sector reform. Improved access to financial services can facilitate the rebalancing process by boosting household consumption, or alleviating constraints faced by firms, in particular smaller ones and those seeking to invest in the services sectors. **Second, China more specifically faces a number of challenges in rebalancing growth.** Turning away from export-oriented growth could lead to job losses in the short term, but employment would actually rise in the longer-term as more jobs are being created in the domestic-demand oriented sectors. On the demand side, weak consumption, or high household saving, in China is not somehow preordained by culture. Instead, it may be responsive to policies, including higher public spending on health or improving access of households to financial services. **Finally, a sustainable global recovery will also depend on how we manage to reduce social imbalances.** In Asia, the recovery has not been as 'jobless'\u009d as it has been in some other parts of the world, but inequality and a lack of social safety nets are concerns across many emerging economies in Asia. In fact, as the book shows, better provision of social services could play a critical role in boosting household consumption in China. **Will rebalancing work? ** **To be sure, rebalancing will take time and policies will need to be comprehensive and tailored to country-specific circumstances.** But, if Hong Kong's successful transformation from a small-scale manufacturer to a global logistics and finance hub can teach us something, it is that we should embrace changes that make our economies more sustainable.

Much of this weighs on my mind as I am here in Hong Kong to launch our April 2011 _[Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific._ **While the outlook is by no means gloomy, it is an opportune time to consider how Asia should manage the next phase of growth.** **Economic outlook** **Economic growth averaged 8.3 percent across the region in 2010, on the back of both strong exports and domestic demand.** Asian exports, especially of high-tech products, have benefitted from higher global investment, and domestic consumption and investment from rising employment, abundant credit, and supportive macroeconomic policies. **Growth is likely to remain robust, averaging 7 percent in both 2011 and 2012 (compared to 4.5 percent global growth).** China and India will remain in the lead, and their growth will increasingly benefit other economies in the region. The economic spillovers from Japan are still unclear, as events are unfolding, but the early and decisive policy actions helped to limit the initial damage. And we expect that the impact will remain limited, provided that disruptions to the production and distribution network'the 'supply chain'\u009d'are not protracted. **Near-term risks &amp; policy choices** **The risks to Asia's economic outlook are more balanced than in our last assessment six months ago**, mainly reflecting [receding financial risks in advanced economies. **But new downside risks have emerged**: * the potential for higher oil prices, particularly due to unrest in the Middle East, which could disrupt global growth and fuel inflation; * overheating risks in many Asian economies in terms of both consumer price inflation and asset prices. **Against this background, the need to tighten macroeconomic policies in Asia has become more pressing now than it was a few months ago.** Of course, the extent of tightening that is needed varies across countries. Several countries have already begun to raise interest rates and reduce fiscal stimulus. But more needs to be done. For example, real policy rates are still negative in several regional economies, including China, Korea and India. Also, exchange rate appreciation can be a key defense against overheating pressures, as it would help tighten overall financial conditions, reducing the burden of adjustment on higher interest rates. Policymakers sometimes fear that tightening could attract volatile capital inflows, but in fact such inflows have moderated in recent months, making the task of tightening easier. **The next phase** For the longer haul, there are two priority issues to strengthen the platform for sustained strong growth in Asia. **First, persistent global imbalances indicate that many of the distortions that characterized the pre-crisis period remain unchanged.** Policies targeted at correcting these distortions will reinforce the sustainability of global growth prospects. In Asia, this will mean moving ahead with policies to boost domestic demand, such as extending social safety nets and boosting infrastructure investment. **Second, is the social dimension.** Although labor market conditions in Asia are generally better than elsewhere in the world, persistent poverty in some countries, and high inequality and youth unemployment are pressing challenges. Promoting more inclusive growth will also help make growth more durable. ", "index": 623}, {"pub": "4/26/2011", "title": "Promises, Promises. Better Measuring the Effect of Pension Reform", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3128", "content": " [By [Benedict Clements We all hope to retire one day. Our pensions hold the promise of that. **But when that promise is a public pension, it's also a lot like debt the government has to pay at some point in the future.** Good fiscal policy means thinking about how policy decisions'especially ones that involve long-term promises, such as pensions'affect government finances both today and in the future. **Problems, problems** **The first problem is that good fiscal policy hasn't always ruled the day, to put it mildly.** Today, pension reform is a priority for the advanced economies as current trends are unsustainable'see [Commandment V'and for many [emerging and low-income economies that need 'to improve coverage of health and pension systems in a fiscally sound manner.'\u009d **The second problem is that traditional deficit and debt indicators focus on the health of public finances today, but fail to capture the future impact of pension promises.** This means that pension reforms, which often strengthen the fiscal position down the road, might not necessarily improve'and sometimes worsen'traditional fiscal indicators today. The risk is that assessments of pension reforms based on traditional deficit and debt indicators could create incentives to delay or even reverse reforms. **A 'pension-adjusted'\u009d budget balance** **This underscores the need for a fiscal indicator that gives governments credit for pension reforms that improve long-term fiscal health, but also correctly points out when they are moving in the wrong direction.** In a recent [Staff Discussion Note, **we propose a new indicator'the 'pension-adjusted'\u009d budget balance'that takes into account the long-term nature of pensions.** It focuses on the fiscal sustainability of pensions and provides a level playing field for evaluating a country's pension policies. The new indicator achieves this by recalculating the traditional budget balance to take into account the _intertemporal_ pension balance (that is, future pension imbalances), rather than the _current_ pension balance. In other words, and simplifying a little, this means taking account of the difference between the current value of future pension contributions and the current value of all future benefits, from today to a certain date in the future, say 50 years. And not just the difference between pension contributions and benefits today. Figure 1 shows how pension reforms in selected countries can impact the total amount'or stock'of pension liabilities as measured today (that is, in terms of net present value, NPV), the traditional headline budget balances, and 'pension-adjusted'\u009d balances. In looking at this chart, it is important to keep in mind that both the headline and pension-adjusted balances are annual flow concepts, while the NPV of pension liabilities is a stock concept (and thus much higher as a percent of a single year's GDP). [ * The reforms had a large impact on the NPV of net pension liabilities, even though headline balances are worse after the reforms because of the diversion of contributions to second pillar systems with mandatory private accounts. * The pension-adjusted balance, on the other hand, improves with reforms that reduce the NPV of pension liabilities. This eliminates incentives to adopt or dismantle particular systems (including second pillar systems) to improve current-period fiscal indicators. **Policy design** **This indicator can help measure when changes in pension policies are improving or worsening long-term fiscal health.** One advantage is that it eliminates incentives to adopt or dismantle particular systems to improve current-period indicators. Of course, overall balances remain key for evaluating the risks surrounding short-term financing needs. **We draw three main implications for fiscal policy design:** * We should take account of the future impact of pension reforms, or other public programs such as [health care, when we analyze fiscal sustainability. * To do that, we should look at the sum of future pension balances, the _intertemporal_ pension balance. * The 'pension-adjusted'\u009d budget balance should be viewed as a complement, rather than a substitute, for traditional fiscal indicators.

But **let's not forget the fiscal problems that low-income countries face, though they are of a different kind.** **For all too many low-income countries, government tax revenues are far from enough to meet the needs of their people**. Some have made good progress, and this helped them weather the crisis better than many advanced economies'but** there is an underlying, quiet crisis of inadequately resourced governments.** Nor is it just the level of revenue that matters; tax design and implementation are also critical to the efficiency of economic activity, to fairness, and to the legitimacy of the state. **Sharing experiences** **Supporting low-income countries' efforts to strengthen their ability to raise revenue is an important part of the IMF's role in helping them maintain stable and growing economies.** How best to do this was the topic of two recent IMF conferences: one, in [Nairobi, focused on [sub-Saharan Africa; the [other, with a global focus, in Washington DC earlier this week. In both cases, I was impressed by just how candid and frank participants'government officials as well as civil society, donors, business and academics'were about what has and hasn't worked for them. At both events, participants made very clear their view that the IMF's technical support has, and is, helping their countries become better governed states that are responsive to the needs of the people. **But they also made very clear that ultimately the solutions to these problems must be home-grown.** We want to hear your ideas too, on both our [recent paper on this topic and the [G-20's request for major international and regional organizations (including the IMF) to advise them on what they could do to help. Please visit our [comments page to weigh in. **More than 'show me the money'\u009d ** There was, of course, a lot of technical stuff at both events[[i]. I now know much more about the details on which revenue mobilization ultimately depends, such as taxpayer segmentation, compliance management, production sharing agreements, transfer pricing, and small business taxation, among other critical issues. But it is the broader issues that left the most powerful impressions. Four in particular stand out: _(i) Strong Commitment_ **Many low-income countries have shown strong commitment to strengthen their revenue systems, through both administrative reforms and improved tax policies.** There is a lot still to do. In sheer revenue terms, an additional 4 percentage points of GDP or so was suggested needed in some low-income countries if they are meet the [Millennium Development Goals. But there have also been notable successes: Tanzania, for instance, achieved a 5 percentage point increase in its revenue to GDP ratio in the decade after 2000. Such good results exemplify the need for a commitment to the reform process over the medium- to long-term; sustainable changes require continued effort, and, particularly, continued political support. _(ii) Equity, fairness and good governance_ **Strengthening revenue systems is about much more than increasing revenue.** * **Effects on growth and efficiency clearly matter**'the poor are not likely to be best served by tax systems that treat investment harshly, for instance. * **But equity and fairness matter a great deal too, maybe even more.** They matter in themselves: after all, a main reason that low-income countries need more revenue is to finance poverty-reducing measures. And equity and fairness also matter for the legitimacy and effectiveness of the tax system: taxes that are seen as unfair will be poorly complied with. And poor compliance leads itself to actual and perceived unfairness, as only some pay their fair share. * **Then there are links between taxation and building modern, accountable and responsive governments overall.** One reason we have long seen combating corruption in tax administrations as so critical, for instance, has been its potential value in spearheading wider improvements in public governance. Ensuring that elites are seen to pay a decent amount of tax is important in this context too. _(iii) Avoiding exemptions and preferences _ **Exemptions and preferential treatments in tax systems are a pervasive source of revenue loss** in many developing countries'as they are too, of course, in many advanced economies. Discussions at the two recent conferences made clear again that many low- income countries fully understand the misallocation of resources and inequities these create. They feel, though, largely powerless to do much about them because of both strong domestic interests and a perceived need to compete with neighboring countries for foreign investment. Increased transparency has an important role here, particularly in the form of analyzing the revenue losses associated with tax expenditures. So, perhaps, does stronger regional tax cooperation, so countries can avoid 'beggar thy neighbor'\u009d tax policies. _(iv) Political will_ **But addressing inappropriate tax policies, and improving revenue administration and enforcement, is ultimately an act of political will.** The trouble is'and this is my final impression'that we still know very little about this 'political will.' We know it is needed in order to drive through tough policy changes. And that it matters to build and support firm, even-handed enforcement. But there are many hard questions, to which we don't yet have the answers, about where political will comes from and how to create it. Our best hope of finding the answers is by continuing the kind of dialogue we have had in Nairobi and Washington. * * * [[i] You can find the presentations from the Washington event at [www.imf.org/fadrmdc.

For a decade or more, we [have grappled with the idea that very large capital flows into successful emerging market countries were almost inevitable and would prove extremely difficult to manage. And now, with capital flows becoming larger and more volatile, old policy dilemmas are resurfacing with even greater force. **Awkward dilemma** The argument went as follows: * Capital was scarce in emerging market economies relative to advanced economies. This would mean that rates of return would be higher as technology and institutional effectiveness caught up. Higher returns, together with the likely strengthening of emerging market currencies, would probably elicit large capital inflows. * If monetary policy sought to contain demand by raising interest rates, this would attract more capital inflows and lead to correspondingly larger current account deficits. But if interest rates were set relatively low'to avoid these inflows'domestic investment would far exceed saving. Again, there would be large current account deficits. * This awkward dilemma for monetary policy could be resolved by market forces if market risk premiums took proper account of underlying vulnerabilities (like the size of the current account deficit). But this turns out to be a rather big 'if.'\u009d Along the route from very large capital inflows to excessive current account deficits and eventual financial crises there would be numerous warning signs: very rapid credit expansion, much of it in foreign currency; asset price bubbles; a shift in resource allocation out of tradable goods and into nontraded assets (most obviously, housing); [substantial private sector vulnerability to foreign exchange risk; and, finally, a sudden jump in market risk premiums, often for reasons unrelated to domestic policies. **Benign or dangerous?** Perhaps the most interesting part of this whole story is this generalization: different markets react to external forces at different speeds'asset markets much more quickly than product markets. And the speed of reaction is critical in determining the path an economy will take. * In the old days, capital inflows were regarded as wholly benign, and helpful to development and growth. By easing a domestic financing constraint, capital inflows would increase income and growth. * The new view suggests in contrast that surges in capital inflows could well have seriously detrimental effects. For example, the easing of credit conditions would raise prices of assets, chiefly real estate prices. This would divert resources into these assets, rather than benefitting domestic manufacturing. With the availability of overseas-funded bank loans, the increase in real estate prices could become self-reinforcing, to the detriment of other sectors like export production, and a housing price bubble would ensue. **Theory becomes reality** Since these topics were first broached at a theoretical level, we have witnessed developments in a number of [emerging economies in Europe that reinforce the concerns and underscore the implications for policy. In the decade or so before the global financial crisis we saw very rapid growth in these economies. Until about 2003 this proceeded, for the most part, in a benign fashion'these countries were becoming more integrated into the advanced western European countries, and trade was booming. All was well. But, then the warning signs emerged: capital inflows fueled excessive credit expansion, very large foreign exposures increased vulnerability, resources shifted out of tradable goods and into nontraded assets, real estate booms took off, and current account deficits widened. The global financial turbulence prompted a reassessment of risk'a jump in market premiums'that interacted with the vulnerabilities in these emerging European economies to set off crises. Housing bubbles were pricked and burst, the foreign-financed bank credit dried up and wrought havoc on bank balance sheets. But the underlying vulnerabilities, and thus the severity and duration of the downturn, differed substantially across this group of countries. **Live and learn** Two lessons may be learned from the experience. First, the choice between fixed and flexible exchange rates is important, but perhaps not for reasons that are usually put forward. * A fixed exchange rate'insofar as it is seen as an exchange rate guarantee'encourages rapid inflows and foreign exchange exposure, thus exacerbating vulnerabilities. Equally important, under a fixed exchange rate it is very difficult to stop credit booms. Once a credit boom starts, it feeds on itself'rising inflation leads to drop in real interest rates, further boosting demand for credit. * Under a floating regime, countries can moderate excessive credit growth by letting the exchange rate strengthen. This will lower inflation, keep real interest rates higher (and possibly also elicit a perception of foreign exchange risk). * Poland and the Czech Republic'both of which have floating exchange rates'managed to avoid much of the overheating that took place in fixed exchange rate countries like Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria. With much lower initial imbalances and vulnerabilities, they weathered the global crisis much better and have had much faster recoveries. Second, monetary policy'and policy to stabilize the economy more generally'needs substantial reinforcement. This is particularly true for countries with some inflexibility in their exchange rates because of their commitment to the euro or a particular path to euro adoption. Stabilizing the economy will require policymakers to be keenly attuned to financial conditions and to draw on a [menu of policy options, combining the right structural reforms and macroeconomic policies with regulatory (both micro- and [macro-prudential) instruments and taxes, and in some cases, even disincentives for foreign currency borrowing or lending.

But, we've slipped well beyond a year and the financial system is still flirting with danger. [Durable financial stability has, so far, proven elusive. Financial stability risks may have eased, reflecting improvements in the [economic outlook and continuing accommodative policies. **But those supportive policies'while necessary to restart the economy'have also masked serious, underlying financial vulnerabilities that need to be addressed as quickly as possible.** * Many advanced economies are 'living dangerously'\u009d because the legacy of high debt burdens is weighing on economic activity and balance sheets, keeping risks to financial stability elevated. * At the same time, many emerging market countries risk overheating and the build-up of financial imbalances'in the context of rapid credit growth, increasing asset prices, and strong and volatile capital inflows. Here is our suggested [**roadmap for policymakers** to address these vulnerabilities and risks, and achieve durable financial stability. **_Heeding the warning signs_** **Challenges in four key areas put financial stability at risk. ** **Confidence in the banking system has yet to be fully restored, nearly four years since the start of the global financial crisis**. Progress in strengthening capital positions and reducing leverage has been uneven. There is considerable uncertainty about the quality of some bank assets, particularly exposures to higher-risk sovereigns and real estate in some countries. And a weak tail of undercapitalized banks remains. We have analyzed the sample of banks that European authorities used in last year's stress tests. This snapshot of end-2010 data revealed that **30 per cent of these banks'representing a fifth of their total assets'have Core Tier 1 capital ratios of less than 8 percent**. This makes them less able to withstand shocks and secure cost-effective funding. To solve these problems, we need comprehensive policies to increase bank transparency, raise capital buffers, and restructure and resolve weak banks. The forthcoming stress tests by the European Banking Authority are an important opportunity to assess the health of the EU banking system. But the tests need to be credible, stringent, and part of a broader crisis management strategy that includes backstops against capital shortfalls. **Sovereign balance sheets remain under strain in several**** advanced economies. **Certain countries in the euro area are especially at risk, because market concerns about the sustainability of public debt have prompted a sharp increase in funding costs and restricted credit supply, creating an adverse feedback loop with the real economy. These financial stability risks need to be addressed through strategies that combine [medium-term budget deficit reduction with adequate multilateral backstops for crisis countries.**** Sovereign funding challenges could extend beyond the euro area. Both the United States and Japan are sensitive to higher funding burdens if interest rates increase substantially** **from current levels. Consequently, these countries need to take decisive action to ensure the sustainability of their public finances over the medium term. **Household indebtedness in the United States remains elevated.** This could negatively affect bank balance sheets, credit availability, and house prices. And, this could be a drag on the global economic recovery. More structural policies may be needed to address high household debt, including principal write-downs on mortgages. Our analysis shows that **US banks are strong enough to withstand sizeable reductions in the principal of risky mortgages**. **Policymakers in emerging markets need to guard against overheating and a buildup of financial imbalances**. A number of factors point to the incubation of financial imbalances, including: * Exceptionally strong **bank credit growth **in some countries. Experience shows that there is a close connection between high credit growth and future increases in non-performing loans. * Strong, and more volatile, **capital inflows**. Capital inflows are not yet excessive, but recent volatility has already tested the absorptive capacity of some emerging markets. **_Putting danger behind us_** **So what can policymakers do to achieve durable financial stability?** **Advanced economies need to deal with the legacy of the crisis'effectively and immediately. **They must reduce their reliance on policies that mainly responded to the **symptoms of the crisis**, and increase their focus on measures that address the **underlying causes**. In particular, they need to fully repair their banking systems, strengthen sovereign balance sheets, and reduce household debt burdens. By contrast, **emerging economies need to act'before it's too late'to avoid future crises**. Given the risk of overheating and financial imbalances, policymakers need to make more, and better, use of macroeconomic measures, such as official rate hikes, more flexible exchange rates, and fiscal tightening. [Macroprudential policies and, in some cases, [capital controls can play a supportive role. Of course, internationally consistent regulation is the cornerstone on which a safer global financial system can be built. Advanced economies and emerging markets, therefore, have a **shared responsibility **to press ahead with regulatory reforms. **_No one said it was going to be easy_** The task ahead is not easy. **There are very real risks: risks of complacency; of fatigue; or reluctance to make hard policy choices.** **Action is needed now to ensure that the outstanding threats to global financial stability are dealt with once and for all.** And only through international cooperation can those actions prove fully effective. The global economic recovery will be on firmer ground only if we achieve **durable** financial stability.

How bad was the fiscal situation at end 2010? One way to look at this is to gauge the improvement needed to stabilize the government's debt to GDP ratio'what we regard as the minimum goal of any sustainable policy. I expanded on this issue in my [press conference remarks, but here are the bare bones of it. * **With only two exceptions, no advanced economy had in 2010 a sufficiently strong cyclically-adjusted primary budget balance'total budget balance excluding the effects of the business cycle and interest payments'to keep its debt ratio from continuing to rise.** * ****The situation is completely different for emerging economies because their primary balances are not as weak and most have had a favorable differential between interest rate and growth'a key driver of the debt ratio'for many decades. **However, stabilizing debt at post-crisis levels would not be a good outcome in the longer run.** High debt is likely to be associated with higher real interest rates, lower growth, and higher exposure to shocks. It also leaves less space to respond when new shocks come in the future. For almost all advanced countries, with the notable exception of United States and Japan, deficits are expected to decline in 2011; major adjustment efforts are on tap for 2012 in almost all, based on the medium term adjustment plans that most countries have now produced. **But, even then most countries will still be far away from the long term adjustment target.** **Speed bumps** There are three major sources of uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook: **First, there is the risk of financial sector shocks that could require additional support for the financial sector.** At this point, this risk seems to be limited to some specific countries, in the absence of additional shocks, but it could trigger more general adverse market reactions. **Second, there could be fiscal policy implementation shocks. **Problems may arise in some countries because of the political cycle. The adjustment envisaged in 2012 is particularly daunting, one of the largest on record, particularly in the US. Over the medium-term, the adjustment is further complicated by having to take place at a time when spending for pension and health care will be tending to increase. **Third, interest rate shocks could materialize. Here, the focus is the differential between the interest rate and growth.** The assumptions underlying the baseline are fairly benign, especially for advanced countries, where the differential is projected to be negative during 2011-15. This could happen given cyclical conditions, but there are major risks in the presence of a rising debt stock. **This is a risk for emerging economies too, where we also project the interest rate-growth differential to remain negative. Here things are more complicated, though. ** * **For emerging economies, the largely negative interest rate-growth differential in the decades before the crisis allowed them to run primary deficits, while maintaining a stable debt ratio.** Indeed, in most emerging economies, the average real interest rate on public debt was negative. We suspect this reflects financial market underdevelopment and financial repression'through, for example, but not exclusively, liquidity constraints or interest rate ceilings. * **This means that, as these countries liberalize their financial markets, interest rates on public debt will rise, requiring adjustments in their primary balances.** How fast this will happen is hard to say, but it casts a shadow on the fiscal baseline for these economies. In this respect, it is also important to stress that the baseline for emerging economies also reflects other favorable conditions, including high commodity prices, strong capital inflows and asset prices, and, in general, strong growth. **The road ahead** **The fiscal outlook is clearly more challenging for advanced economies, but there are also risks for emerging markets. ** It is difficult to assess the likelihood that the weak state of public finances would lead to major disturbances in some sovereign debt markets, particularly the largest ones. The largest advanced countries have a lot of credibility. The risk that sovereign debt problems arise in these markets is a 'tail'\u009d'or extreme'event, but one that would have major consequences for them and also for the rest of the world. **Even if these tail risks do not materialize, there is the risk that, over the medium term, fiscal adjustment in advanced economies will run out of gas midway up the mountain, leaving public debt stable in relation to GDP, but at very high levels. This would be detrimental for real interest rates and growth over the medium term. ** ", "index": 630}, {"pub": "4/11/2011", "title": "Global Recovery Strengthens, Tensions Heighten", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=3014", "content": " [ [[By [Olivier Blanchard ## **The [world economic recovery is gaining strength, but it remains unbalanced.** **Three numbers tell the story.** We expect the world economy to grow at about 4.5 percent a year in both 2011 and 2012, but with advanced economies growing at only 2.5 percent, while emerging and developing economies grow at a much higher 6.5 percent. **On the good news side. Earlier fears of a double dip'which we did not share'have not materialized.** The main worry was that, in advanced economies, after an initial recovery driven by the inventory cycle and fiscal stimulus, growth would fizzle. The inventory cycle is now largely over, fiscal stimulus has turned to fiscal consolidation, but private demand has, for the most part, taken up the relay. **Fears have turned to commodity prices.** Commodity prices have increased more than expected, reflecting a combination of strong demand growth and a number of supply shocks. These increases conjure the specter of 1970s style stagflation, but they appear unlikely to derail the recovery. * In advanced countries, the decreasing share of [oil, the disappearance of wage indexation, and the anchoring of inflation expectations, all combine to suggest small effects on either growth or core inflation. * The challenge is greater in emerging market and developing countries, where the share of [food in consumption is larger, and the credibility of monetary policy is often weaker. Inflation may well be higher for some time but, as our forecasts indicate, we do not expect a major adverse effect on growth. **Turning to the bad news. The recovery, however, remains unbalanced.** **In most advanced economies, output is still far below potential. Unemployment is high, and low growth implies that it will remain so for many years to come. The source of low growth can be traced to both pre-crisis excesses and to crisis wounds.** In many countries, especially in the United States, the housing market is still depressed, leading to anemic housing investment. The crisis itself has led to a large deterioration in fiscal positions, forcing a shift to fiscal consolidation, while not eliminating market worries about fiscal sustainability. And, in many countries, banks are struggling to achieve higher capital ratios in the face of increasing non-performing loans. **The problems in Europe's periphery'with the combined effects of low growth, fiscal woes, and financial pressures'are particularly acute.** Reestablishing fiscal and financial sustainability, in the face of low or negative growth and high interest rates, is a substantial challenge, and will take time. And, while they are extreme, the problems of Europe's periphery point to a more general problem, an underlying low rate of growth of potential output. **Adjustment is very hard when growth is very low.** **The policy advice to advanced countries remains largely the same as in [previous World Economic Outlooks, and so far, has been only partly heeded.** Increased clarity on banks' exposures with ready recapitalization plans if and where needed. Smart fiscal consolidation, that is neither too fast, which could kill growth, nor too slow, which would kill credibility. The redesign of financial regulation and supervision. And, especially in Europe, an increased focus on reforms to increase potential growth. **In emerging market countries by contrast, the crisis has not left lasting wounds.** Their fiscal and financial positions were typically stronger to start, and adverse effects of the crisis have been more muted. High underlying growth and low interest rates are making fiscal adjustment much easier. Exports have largely recovered, and whatever shortfall in external demand they experienced has typically been made up through an increase in domestic demand. Capital outflows have turned into capital inflows, due to both better growth prospects and higher interest rates than in advanced countries. **The challenge for most emerging countries is quite different from that of advanced countries, namely how to avoid overheating in the face of closing output gaps and higher capital flows.** Their response should be twofold. * First, rely on a combination of higher interest rates and fiscal consolidation to maintain output at potential. * Second, use a mix of reserve accumulation and [macroprudential tools, including, where needed, [capital controls, to avoid increases in systemic risk stemming from inflows. Countries are often tempted to resist the exchange rate appreciation which is likely to come with higher interest rates and higher inflows. But appreciation increases real income, is part of the desirable adjustment, and should not be resisted. **Overall, the macroeconomic policy agenda for the world economy remains the same, but with the passage of time, more urgent.** For the recovery to be sustained, advanced countries must reduce government deficits and debt levels. To do so and to maintain growth, they need to rely more on external demand. Symmetrically, emerging market countries must rely less on external demand, and more on domestic demand. Appreciation of emerging market countries' currencies relative to advanced countries' currencies is an important key to this global adjustment. **The need for careful design of policies at the national level, and coordination at the global level, may be as important today as they were at the peak of the crisis two years ago.** ", "index": 631}, {"pub": "4/8/2011", "title": "Warning! Inequality May Be Hazardous to Your Growth", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2992", "content": " By [Andrew G. Berg and [Jonathan D. Ostry **Many of us have been struck by the huge increase in income inequality in the United States in the past thirty years.** The rich have gotten much richer, while just about everyone else has had very modest income growth. **Some dismiss inequality and focus instead on overall growth'arguing, in effect, that a rising tide lifts all boats**. But assume we have a thousand boats representing all the households in the United States, with boat length proportional to family income. In the late 1970s, the average boat was a 12 foot canoe and the biggest yacht was 250 feet long. Thirty years later, the average boat is a slightly roomier 15 footer, while the biggest yacht, at over 1100 feet, would dwarf the Titanic! **When a handful of yachts become ocean liners while the rest remain lowly canoes, something is seriously amiss. ** **In fact, inequality matters. And it matters in all corners of the globe.** You need look no further than the role it might have played in the historic transformation underway in the Middle East. The increase in U.S. income inequality in recent decades is strikingly similar to the increase in the 1920s. In both cases there was a boom in the financial sector, poor people borrowed a lot, and it all ended in huge financial crises. Did the recent financial crisis result somehow from the increase in inequality? **Some time ago, we became interested in long periods of high growth ('growth spells'\u009d) and what keeps them going.** The initial thought was that sometimes crises happen when a 'growth spell'\u009d comes to an end, as perhaps occurred with Japan in the 1990s. We approached the problem as a medical researcher might think of life expectancy, looking at age, weight, gender, smoking habits, etc. We do something similar, looking for what might bring long 'growth spells'\u009d to an end by focusing on factors like political institutions, health and education, macroeconomic instability, debt, trade openness, and so on. Somewhat to our surprise,** income inequality stood out in [our analysis as a key driver of the duration of 'growth spells'\u009d.** **We [found that high 'growth spells'\u009d were much more likely to end in countries with less equal income distributions. The effect is large.** For example, we estimate that closing, say, half the inequality gap between Latin America and emerging Asia would more than double the expected duration of a 'growth spell'\u009d. **Inequality seemed to make a big difference almost no matter what other variables were in the model or exactly how we defined a 'growth spell'\u009d.** Inequality is of course not the only thing that matters but, from our analysis, it clearly belongs in the 'pantheon'\u009d of well-established growth factors such as the quality of political institutions or trade openness. While income distribution within a given country is pretty stable most of the time, it sometimes moves a lot. In addition to the United States in recent decades, we've also seen changes in China and many other countries. Brazil reduced inequality significantly from the early 1990s through a focused set of transfer programs that have become a model for many around the world. A reduction of the magnitude achieved by Brazil could'albeit with uncertainty about the precise effect'increase the expected length of a typical 'growth spell'\u009d by about 50 percent. **The upshot? It is a big mistake to separate analyses of growth and income distribution.** A rising tide is still critical to lifting all boats. The implication of our analysis is that helping to raise the lowest boats may actually help to keep the tide rising! The immediate role for policy, however, is less clear. More inequality may shorten growth duration, but poorly designed efforts to reduce inequality could be counterproductive. If these distort incentives and thereby undermine growth, they can do more harm than good to the poor. Still, there may be some 'win-win'\u009d policies, such as better-targeted subsidies, better access to education for the poor that improves equality of economic opportunity, and active labor market measures that promote employment. When there are short-run trade-offs between the effects of policies on growth and income distribution, the evidence in our paper doesn't in itself say what to do. **But** **our analysis should tilt the balance towards the long-run benefits'including for growth'of reducing inequality.** Over longer horizons, reduced inequality and sustained growth may be [two sides of the same coin. Stepping further back, all this reminds us of the 1980s debt crises and the resulting 'lost decade'\u009d of slow growth and painful adjustment. That experience brought home the fact that sustainable economic reform is possible only when the benefits are widely shared. **In the face of the current global economic turmoil and the need for difficult economic adjustment and reform in many countries, it would be better if these old lessons could be remembered rather than relearned.** ", "index": 632}, {"pub": "4/8/2011", "title": "Macroprudential Policy\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Filling the Black Hole", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2980", "content": " [By [Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Vi\u00c3?als When the global financial system was thrown into crisis, many policymakers were shocked to discover a gaping hole in their policy toolkit. They have since made significant progress in developing [macroprudential policy measures aimed at containing system-wide risks in the financial sector. Yet progress has been uneven. **Greater efforts are needed to transform this policy patchwork into an effective crisis-prevention toolkit. ** **Given the enormous economic and human cost of the recent financial debacle, I strongly believe that we cannot afford to miss this opportunity for substantial reform**. Modern macroeconomics evolved in response to the policy limitations that were painfully underscored by the Great Depression. Macroprudential policy could prove to be the next quantum leap. This is why the group of twenty leading economies (G-20) asked the IMF, [Financial Stability Board (FSB), and [Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to develop a coherent framework for this new policy. **It involves a wide range of systemic risk indicators'that is, indicators that gauge system-wide risks, rather than risks affecting individual institutions' **focusing on such areas as the resilience of financial system to shocks, the availability of funding in financial markets, market participants' interconnectedness, household indebtedness, and international capital flows. The list of policy tools includes, for example, countercyclical capital requirements, loan-to-value ratios that help prevent the out of control credit growth that led to recent housing bubbles, and systemic capital and liquidity surcharges reflecting institutions' contribution to systemic risk. Earlier this week, the IMF Executive Board discussed a [new paper that sets out the IMF's thinking on the main elements of the new policy. The paper'drawing also on a [survey of 63 member countries'shows that **further efforts are needed to develop new tools and broader, forward-looking measures of systemic risk.** Moreover, a new policy framework'based on international best practices'will need to be firmly established. This would greatly reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage by global financial firms seeking to exploit policy loopholes. Systemic risks'both national and international'can no longer be addressed through the traditional mix of macroeconomic policies and 'micro-prudential'\u009d measures aimed at _individual _financial institutions. By focusing on the health of the financial system as a whole, macroprudential policy can improve the authorities' grasp of the intricate web of connections between financial institutions, financial markets, and the macro-economy. The new tools would enhance policymakers' ability to cope with two, interrelated drivers of systemic risk. They include (i) risks associated with swings in credit and liquidity cycles, driven by pro-cyclical forces such as leverage and herding behavior by financial institutions, non-financial firms, and households; and (ii) the concentration of risk in certain financial institutions and markets that are highly interconnected within, and across, national borders. Developing a coherent policy framework is a really challenging task. National policymakers have been grappling with this, both at the conceptual level and in practical terms. The new IMF paper aims to clarify the concept of the macroprudential policy and its role in preserving financial stability. The IMF Executive Board, representing all member countries, broadly agreed with the proposed definition of macroprudential policy and its objectives, which is a milestone in developing the framework further. They have also accepted directions for further work, which would help the IMF facilitate the development and sharing of best practices throughout our member countries. Yet, despite recent progress, many issues remain unresolved. For example, how strong is the evidence that macroprudential policies can, in fact, prevent or contain asset price bubbles? Which policy tool'or combination of tools'should be used? What about possible conflicts with other policy objectives in the monetary and fiscal areas? Which institutions would be best-placed to detect and contain future systemic risks? The challenges facing policymakers are daunting. They need to: * Create a comprehensive analytical framework and a consistent set of policy tools, including through rigorous back-testing. * Establish macroprudential authorities with clear mandates to enhance their accountability and reduce the risk of political pressure. All institutional arrangements should reflect country-specific characteristics. * Assure addressing all systemic risks and manage potential policy conflicts through cooperation among national authorities. * Increase international cooperation to ensure the consistent application of national macro-prudential policies. The IMF stands ready to support such efforts through its surveillance mandate and financial sector expertise. I look forward to the joint IMF-FSB-BIS progress report on the new macroprudential policy framework, to be discussed at the G-20 Summit in November 2011. **We need further collective efforts to fill the policy black hole. It is our best chance of avoiding future crises.** ", "index": 633}, {"pub": "4/6/2011", "title": "Reducing the Chance of Pulling the Plug on Liquidity", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2953", "content": " [By [Jeanne Gobat The near collapse of the financial system that set off the global crisis was due in part to financial institutions suddenly lacking access to funding markets, and liquidity drying-up across securities markets. Many financial institutions were unable to roll over or obtain short term funding without sustaining significant losses. This threatened to sink them. Financial institutions did not factor in how their own responses to a liquidity shortfall could make the entire system shut down and less stable'that is, they underestimated their contribution to systemic liquidity risk in good times, and did not bear the cost of their actions on others in bad times. **It only takes a few institutions to pull the plug on a liquidity-filled bathtub before it runs dry, and the central bank needs to open the spigots again. ** **The key then is to make sure that firms have less incentive to pull the plug. This requires establishing the right incentives in the good times.** We argue that more needs to be done to introduce [macroprudential policies'ones that take into account **the big picture of the financial system as a whole.** In the latest [Global Financial Stability Report, we have come up with a way to measure how much an individual financial institution contributes to system-wide liquidity risk. This can be used to develop a macroprudential tool to capture the cost an institution imposes on the rest of the system. For instance, this can be achieved by requiring all financial firms that contribute to systemic liquidity risk to buy insurance proportionate to the expected contingent liquidity support they might need from central banks in times of systemic liquidity stress. We propose three different approaches to measuring systemic liquidity risk: * **a systemic liquidity risk index** that captures breakdowns of various financial arbitrage relationships across securities and can be used to signal a tightening of market liquidity and funding liquidity conditions. * **a systemic risk-adjusted liquidity model** that can be used to calculate a time-varying, forward looking market-based measure of systemic liquidity risk, and an institution's contribution to that risk; and. * **a macro stress-testing model** which gauges the effects of an adverse macroeconomic or financial environment on the solvency of institutions and in turn the impact failures may have on liquidity shortfalls of others. Financial institutions have dealings with one another. Taking those interactions into account, we found that the probability that _all_ institutions would have troubles meeting their cash flow needs was far higher during times of extreme market disruptions compared to if one were to simply add up each individual institution's chances of liquidity problems. **Our research underscores that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.** The connections between asset and funding markets, and the relationships among financial institutions themselves, contribute to liquidity risk in the financial system in a way that cannot'and should not'be underestimated. The next step is to test the models to see how they perform, and whether a capital surcharge or an insurance premium more cost effectively captures an institution's contribution to systemic liquidity risk. Ideally, our framework should be expanded to include all non-bank financial institutions that contribute to systemic liquidity risk. This can include special investment vehicles, money market mutual funds, hedge funds, finance companies and others. Much of this will depend on the structure of a financial system, and will vary from country to country. Finally, we emphasize that a _multipronged_ regulatory approach will have to be taken to address systemic liquidity risk. For instance, imposing add-on capital surcharges to control systemic _solvency_ risk among global systemically important financial institutions, as is being currently considered under the G-20 reform agenda,may also help lower systemic _liquidity_ risk. The two risks are closely interrelated: if a regulator or supervisor imposes a capital surcharge for systemic solvency risk on financial institutions and that lessens the need to rely on systemic liquidity risk mitigation techniques, all the better. But if the chosen measurement technique finds that there is still a residual contribution to systemic liquidity risk then an institution would then need to pay for it. Finally, measures to make funding markets work better by strengthening the infrastructure underpinning them, for instance by having collateral behind repurchase agreements registered with central counterparties, would also help lower systemic liquidity risk. A number of reforms have been put in place to address liquidity risk management at the individual firm level. The introduction of new quantitative liquidity standards under [Basel III for commercial banks should help enhance the stability of the banking sector and indirectly help mitigate systemic liquidity risk. But at their core Basel III reforms are microprudential'that is they are firm specific, and do not account for the myriad connections between institutions in the financial system, or its pro-cyclical tendencies'both which contribute to a buildup of systemic liquidity risk.

Then you can begin'yes, just begin'to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem in South Africa. **Unemployment in [South Africa now stands at some 24 percent. Youth unemployment is phenomenally higher still at some 50 percent.** Unemployment in South Africa was already very high before the crisis due to a number of structural factors'such as mismatches between the kinds of jobs available and workers' skills, or large distances between population centers and where businesses are located. **But, the enormous job losses during 2008-09 made the already dire situation much worse. **South Africa did not have a financial crisis and its recession was, relatively speaking, mild. Still, the country lost proportionately as many formal sector jobs (1 million) as those countries at the center of the global financial crisis. **Like the government, we see reducing unemployment as the foremost economic challenge facing the country. **Trying to understand why recent labor markets outcomes have been so bad and, more important still, what it will take to reverse the increase in unemployment is a thus an ongoing focus of [our work. ** ** **_Pieces to the puzzle_** One interesting finding is that, despite high unemployment, South Africa's labor markets are relatively dynamic. **During the growth upswing of the mid-2000s, the country was very good at creating jobs; but when the economy hits a rough patch, job losses also tend to be very high. **For each 1 percentage point increase in growth, employment growth tends to increase by more than 1 percentage point. Unfortunately, the same is true when growth declines.** ** **This goes some way towards explaining the relatively large magnitude of job shedding during the recent recession. But it also implies that wages do not respond much to changes in the demand for labor.** When there is an adverse shock to demand, it is the level of employment rather than wages that adjust. Of course, in most countries, wages are generally 'sticky' downwards and do not decline in nominal terms. But seldom does one also see large economy-wide increases in real wages'wages rising faster than inflation'during a recession. Yet, that is exactly what happened in South Africa in 2009. Last December I had the opportunity to meet with some Members of South Africa's Parliament. We exchanged views on the impact of the global financial crisis on the country. When I laid out the ideas above, one of the Members asked if I thought that the country's employment protection laws were the cause. As I noted then, this is not my view. **Indeed, I firmly believe that the country's labor legislation provides important and necessary'and hard won'protection for workers. Rather, what would be worthwhile is a close look at the wage bargaining framework to ensure that most of the adjustment in the labor market does not continue to fall mainly on the number of jobs**. Wage moderation during downturns would not seem that unreasonable a trade-off. **Likely solutions** **Beyond a more flexible wage bargaining framework, here's my take on what is required to make significant inroads into high unemployment in South Africa.** **_Higher growth._** The government's recent budget document noted that annual growth of the order of 6'7 percent will be needed to meet the target of creating 5 million jobs by 2020. The current fairly supportive monetary and fiscal policies will help in the near-term. But it is unclear where the impetus for the higher growth will come from once macroeconomic policies turn less supportive, with a view to rebuilding the policy buffers run down over the last couple of years. Ideally, growth should be private investment and export led. Looking for ways to promote private investment thus needs to be firmly on the reform agenda in the coming months.** ** **_Making growth more labor intensive_****. **Another approach that should help is targeted interventions to address unemployment in particularly problematic areas'such as youth unemployment. This is, in part, because current wage setting mechanisms do not allow differences in wages that would fully reflect productivity differences between young and old workers. A wage subsidy scheme along the lines recently announced by the government should serve to make it cheaper for firms to employ young workers. Provided the subsidy is carefully designed, it should avoid the displacement of existing workers and also minimize substitution away from older workers. **_More competitive product markets_****. **One of the other problematic features of the South Africa economy is the relatively high cost structure of many of its markets for goods and services. By contributing to higher input costs, this inhibits the external competitiveness of manufacturing and other tradable sectors. Enhancing domestic competition should lower costs for companies but importantly also for consumers.** ** **The big blemish on South Africa's otherwise strong economic performance since the mid-1990s is stubbornly high unemployment. Of course this is an important exception, especially as it has exacerbated income inequality. Doubling growth'from the current 3\u00c2? percent'is the first order of business. And this in turn requires changing the incentives facing firms and employees.** ", "index": 636}, {"pub": "4/2/2011", "title": "New Policy Ideas for a New World: Interview with Robert Solow", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2903", "content": " By [iMFdirect There has been plenty of reflection, during the past few years, on the causes of the global financial crisis. **But, last month's [conference at the IMF focused on taking what we've learned from the crisis and looking toward the [future of economic policy.** [Robert Solow'Professor Emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Nobel Prize winning economist'was among those who brought interesting perspectives and a wealth of experience to the conference discussions. **Watch Professor Solow's interview and hear more about what he has to say on'\u00a6** **'\u00a6the main challenges for policymakers today'\u00a6** _ __'\u00a6the importance of restoring a higher level of economic activity in the advanced countries'particularly in this country, in the U.S.'and the fact that there will have to be some innovative approaches to policy. _ **'\u00a6on monetary policy'\u00a6** _The simple dependence on conventional monetary policy'not to be abandoned, of course'but it seems to have come to its limits and one has to move on even to direct fiscal policy or to innovative ways of dealing with money and credit._ **'\u00a6on fiscal policy'\u00a6** _We are certainly not at the limits of the possibility of public debt '\u00a6 But any aggressive fiscal policy would entail still a bigger buildup of debt, which will have to be settled in the longer run._ **And, on the role of education in economic growth'\u00a6** _We tend to measure education by input, not output.

I am delighted to be back in China this week for a high-level seminar in Nanjing on the [international monetary system. Every time I come to this part of the world, I am impressed by the dynamism of the economies and the optimism of the people. The future is here. The region's economic performance over the past few decades has been nothing short of remarkable. Asia now accounts for about a third of the global economy, up from under just a fifth in 1980. This trend has been reinforced by the crisis, with the emerging market powerhouses leading the global recovery. Asia has also made tremendous progress with poverty reduction. China alone has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past few decades. Such a feat has never before been accomplished in the history of human civilization. But to sustain this progress, Asia needs to grapple with numerous challenges today, among them the need to deal with overheating pressures and volatile capital inflows. And this relates directly to our discussion at [Nanjing. The current [international monetary system has certainly delivered a lot. But it also has flaws that need to be fixed, especially if the next phase of globalization is to succeed in bringing a strong and broad-based rise in living standards. I see four pressing issues: * **_Imbalances across and within countries_**. We need stronger cooperation to promote effective global adjustment and discourage countries from running policies that lead to global imbalances. The G20 Mutual Assessment Process and the IMF's 'spillover reports'\u009d for the five most important systemic economies'which look at the effects of country policies across their borders'are steps in the right direction. More ambitious ideas, including a strengthening of countries' multilateral obligations and of accountability mechanisms for these, are also worth discussing. * **_No framework to oversee capital flows_**. Everybody knows that capital flows can sometimes be destabilizing. This is something many countries worry about. But we do not have globally agreed \"rules of the road\" on what they should do. Sometimes we need to look at old ideas with a fresh perspective, and we are developing more of a consensus view. In the past, capital controls were not in our toolkit. Today, we see them more as part of the toolkit, although only in specific circumstances and not, of course, as a substitute for good macroeconomic policies. * **_Inadequate global liquidity_**. We need to strengthen the global financial safety net, to reduce the need to 'self-insure'\u009d by building up costly reserves buffers. There are a number of options here. One possibility is to strengthen partnerships with regional financing arrangements. Another is to improve the predictability of systemic liquidity provision more generally. * **_Too few options for safe global assets to meet the demand_**. The question here is how to diversify reserve assets. One option is to encourage greater international use of currencies other than the four currently in the SDR basket, including those of large dynamic emerging markets. Over the longer term, the SDR itself could play a greater role. These issues go right to the heart of the IMF's mandate, and their resolution will require further engagement and discussion among our global membership. Certainly, they are challenges in which all global citizens have a stake'to support an ongoing recovery and avoid future crises, ensuring better outcomes for all. The Nanjing meeting was a useful step toward the international monetary system of the future. And speaking as the head of the IMF, it was also a useful step in advancing the partnership between Asia and the Fund. A partnership that I firmly believe will continue to strengthen in the future.

The key conclusion that I took away from [these meetings is that **Latin America faces** **two principal economic challenges: to increase the sustainable rate of economic growth and to reduce the volatility of growth.** In my meeting in Calgary on March 26 with Finance Ministers of the region, I focused on the second challenge so that favorable conditions today do not come at the expense of a bust tomorrow. It's a nice coincidence that this meeting of Finance Ministers of the Americas and the Caribbean was held here in [Calgary. Canada is a good example of 'managing the good times,'\u009d but as in many countries across the globe, some challenges remain. **Managing the good times** Turning to **Latin America**, here are three ways in which the region can reduce its vulnerability to wide economic fluctuations. * **First, sound economic policies.** One of the reasons the region weathered the global financial crisis relatively well is that it had made significant gains in improving economic fundamentals in the years leading up the crisis. This included reducing inflation and public debt, improving the composition of debt, strengthening fiscal institutions, introducing greater exchange rate flexibility and credible monetary regimes, and building up foreign reserves. This progress should continue. * **Second, financial stability.** As the region becomes increasingly integrated in the global economy, it will also become more exposed to the volatility of capital flows. At the same time, financial deepening, though welcome, can bring its own challenges, for example, the risk of credit bubbles. This calls for continued efforts to strengthen the financial system. In particular, regulators and supervisors should be empowered to take early preventive action'including using macroprudential tools. * **Third, a more diversified economy.** There is no simple recipe for achieving the diversification needed to reduce vulnerability to specific external shocks. But countries should continue efforts to foster new sources of growth. More public funding for infrastructure and human capital development can help. Improvements in the business climate'which in some countries includes security'and overall governance are also essential to attract private investment. **What does all this mean now?** ****Growth in most Latin American economies is now back at potential, or above'and in many of them there are worrisome signs of overheating.**** Clearly, the earlier economic stimulus needs to be reversed. Furthermore, a range of policies could be used to prevent overheating and dampen the credit cycle, including upward exchange rate flexibility, a more appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal policies, and adequate financial regulations'including a macroprudential approach. In some cases, capital controls might also be useful. But they should not substitute for fundamental policy adjustments. Finally, I also talked about **sharing the benefits of growth more broadly.** While the region has enjoyed tremendous social gains, poverty and income inequality remain high in Latin America compared with other regions. To have more equitable growth, efforts should center on strengthening the provision and quality of education, health, and public infrastructure. This includes better targeting of government spending and strengthening social safety nets. From [**Di\u00c3\u00a1logo a Fondo**, the IMF's blog for Latin America.

That said, **the good news is that we recognize that in finance and parts of macroeconomics the models or frameworks are incomplete. That represents a challenge to the academic community**. But it also means that, in the short run, participants and regulators will be operating with incomplete models. This will require judgments (which will be uncomfortable in contrast to the earlier sense of certainty). There will be mistakes. And, as [Olivier Blanchard said in his excellent [summary, we will proceed step-by-step, evaluating the impacts of policy choices and sometimes reversing course. This is relatively familiar territory in developing countries, where changes in the institutional depth of the economy mean that models (especially advanced country models) are not very precise in predicting market responses to policy choices. Nevertheless theory is still useful when used judiciously. In that context, you can think of this as analogous to navigating with charts that are incomplete. Having said that**, we do in principle have the option of returning to old patterns while waiting for different or more complete models to be developed and tested, I think there is a widespread recognition that this would be a risky mistake.** I offer some thoughts stimulated by the spirit of the conference; not as a summary, or even an ordered set of priorities, but as a contribution to a general discussion that we all hope might stimulate further research and policy analysis, and ultimately progress. ### 1\\. The Dynamics of Risk in the Financial System **The dynamics of the risk characteristics of the financial system are not well understood by the participants or the regulators. Fixing this represents a central challenge and opportunity for economists.** I think it is one of the hardest challenges in the area of economic and financial theory. With most investors paying more attention to risk factors, and the costs and benefits of liquidity, they are constantly adjusting their investments and the structure of the assets they hold. So, relationships between assets, prices and risk may only remain stable for a few months at a time. The old model with stable relationships, implemented through a largely fixed asset allocation framework is broken. That doesn't mean that diversification is a silly idea. But the challenge is to implement it effectively. Most of the discussion concerns adjustments to the regulatory approach. This is too narrow. Although self-regulation failed in the run up to the crisis, and cannot be relied as the principal element of stability, it remains important. A financial system in which the participants and regulators accurately perceive risk will behave differently, and defensive action by participants when is accurately perceived will be a contributing factor. **2\\. Multiple Targets and Instruments** **It may not be unanimous, but it is close, that the single target ' single instrument approach to policy is not sufficient for achieving financial and macroeconomic stability.** Nor are policies that focus on the flow of funds or resources, and prices likely to be sufficient. And given the state of our knowledge, at this point, we are going to have to pay attention to balance sheet variables and linkages at the micro and macro levels. **There will be warning signs or puzzles, and we are going to have to be willing to act on them without being able to give air tight arguments that there are problems.** That is at variance with our earlier mindset in which the preferred course was inaction unless there was a clear case for intervention. This asymmetric attitude needs to be abandoned in favor of a more balanced assessment of the benefits and risks of inaction versus action. ### 3\\. Understanding Structural Changes in Advanced Economies The structure of all economies evolves in ways that affect the income distribution and employment opportunities. This evolution is driven by powerful market forces operating in the global economy. And, after these changes, economies don't return to their previous average behavior. The vast majority (by population) of the emerging economies only become big once. Major technological innovations can also produce shifts in structure. **Paying attention to structural evolution and incorporating it into longer term policy frameworks seem to me important and worth institutionalizing, with supporting research.** It is of course easier to think about efficiency and market failures and even stability, than it is to address distributional issues and consider interventions that may adversely affect dynamic efficiency at the global level. But the alternative, ignoring the distributional and structural issues, doesn't seem right and has risks. There are more and less harmful ways to nudge structural evolution. Ignoring the issue raises the risks of choices that run toward the more harmful end of the spectrum. ### 4\\. Ban High Speed Trading **I would ban high speed trading'the automated, computer-driven trading of large volumes of financial assets in a short timeframe'by introducing lags in the trading process or increasing capital requirements or both.** As far as I can see, it is entertaining, but it's largely a zero-sum game, using resources, contributing potential volatility in markets. The economic benefits in terms of enhancing the pricing, capital allocation and risk spreading functions of the financial system, seem negligible. ### 5\\. Financial Regulation **Financial regulation is a huge subject, rightly receiving lots of attention. These are just a few thoughts. At the macro level, it seems clear that we need to restrict excessive leverage.** Ditto for banks. Regulating the shadow banking system is crucial. The crisis experience surely tells us that. I would have liked to hear much more about what is needed to properly regulate this part of the financial system in order to ensure stability. This involves ratings, capital requirements, incentives, and structures that, unlike the present ones, allow the unwinding of securitized assets in an efficient way after a shock or crisis. As far as I can tell, the procedures for dealing with underwater mortgages held in trusts supporting securitized assets are essentially broken. This makes recovery from crisis, shocks, and asset bubbles less efficient and much too lengthy. Finally, it seems to be that** the current structure of the financial system'as it has evolved with a pattern of reduced regulation with respect to the separation of functions'is shot through with actual and potential conflicts of interest. These adversely affect incentives and performance and perhaps more importantly trust. This needs to be addressed by regulators, but also by the industry itself. There remains much more to be done, particularly on the industry side.** ", "index": 640}, {"pub": "3/24/2011", "title": "Government Bonds: No Longer a World Without Risk", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2821", "content": " [By [Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Vi\u00c3?als **The risk free nature of government bonds, one of the cornerstones of the global financial system, has come into question as the global crisis unfolds.** One thing is now very clear: government bonds are no longer the risk-free assets they once were. This carries far reaching implications for policymakers, central bankers, debt managers, and how the demand and supply sides of government bond markets function. After a recent [IMF conference on a new approach to government risk, I'd like to highlight three key aspects: * **In a world without a risk free rate**, **the health of the financial sector and the government are closely interconnected.** We need to better understand the linkages between sovereign and financial risks, and conduct a thorough analysis of the channels of cross-border spillovers. Policies to help manage sovereign risk will have a positive impact on financial stability, and measures to stabilize the banking sector will have a favorable impact on sovereign balance sheets. * **Countries with large potential liabilities from their banking sectors need to identify, assess, monitor, and report related risks closely**. The impact of these contingent liabilities on the government's financial position, including its overall liquidity, needs to be assessed when making borrowing decisions. * **The risks involved call for stronger emphasis on stress tests. **There is anecdotal evidence that some debt managers are complementing existing analytical approaches with a greater focus on stress scenarios, including extreme financing shocks. Policymakers could take the extra step and contemplate the role for a joint stress test for systemically important financial institutions and sovereigns. The outcomes of such stress tests could help inform crisis preparedness, debt strategies, as well as financial supervision and regulation. **Implications for supply and demand** These views are the result of some recent profound changes in the way government bond markets operate. On the **demand side of the market**, dealers and investors no longer treat these bonds as purely interest rate products. Far from it, government bonds have assumed characteristics typical of credit products, for which prices mainly provide measures of borrowers' probabilities of default. Many are not as liquid as before and their investor base is not as diversified as it used to be. During phases of risk aversion, they do not benefit from flight to quality flows. On the contrary, they correlate with risky assets. **Credit rating downgrades** play a procyclical role and can **exacerbate these adverse dynamics**. Central bankers generally accept government bonds as collateral in refinancing operations, but, below certain thresholds, lower ratings could trigger sizeable haircuts, in other words, revaluing the bonds substantially below their market value. Regulators could also assign them a non-zero risk weight under the standardized approach and suddenly these bonds are not risk-free rates any longer. And even if bonds such as United States Treasuries and German Bunds have retained most of their risk-free characteristics, the once solid dividing line between interest rate and credit products has become blurred. In the long run, such changes can profoundly affect investors' choices. One example of these changes is that more capital may flow towards emerging markets. These economies have been able to absorb the recent inflows, but the increase in corporate and financial leverage, rising asset prices, and building inflationary pressures may soon translate into growing imbalances and open the door to a new set of challenges to financial stability. **On the supply side of the market**, debt managers in advanced economies have started behaving a bit like their emerging market colleagues. Given the increased exposure to economic and financial risks, they have started placing stronger emphasis on [risk mitigation strategies, well beyond what traditional debt management objectives would indicate. Confronted with the usual trade-off between being predictable or flexible, most of them have erred on the side of flexibility. While retaining an open dialogue with financial markets, they realize that annual programs have to offer sufficient flexibility to cope with the challenges of issuing and managing larger amounts of debt. Finally, debt managers are putting a high premium on proactive and timely communication as well as on understanding the evolving nature of the investor base. These are precisely the elements that were outlined in the 'Stockholm Principles' IMF facilitated with the debt managers in September 2010. **The global crisis is sending many of us back to the drawing board to take a fresh look at old assumptions and long cherished principles, and the risk free nature of government bonds is no exception.** ", "index": 641}, {"pub": "3/22/2011", "title": "A Balanced Debate About Reforming Macroeconomics", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2796", "content": " [Guest post by [Joseph E. Stiglitz, Columbia University, and co-host of the Conference on _Macro and Growth Policies in the Wake of the Crisis_ **The most remarkable aspect of the recent ****[conference**** at the IMF was the broad consensus that the macroeconomic models that had been relied upon in the past and had informed major aspects of monetary and macro-policy had failed.** They failed to predict the crisis; standard models even said bubbles couldn't exist'markets were efficient. Even after the bubble broke, they said the effects would be contained. Even after it was clear that the effects were not 'contained,'\u009d they provided limited guidance on how the economy should respond. Maintaining low and stable inflation did not ensure real economic stability. The crisis was 'man-made.'\u009d While in standard models, shocks were exogenous, here, they were endogenous. **There was even remarkable consensus about many elements of policy in responding to the crisis**: fiscal policy can work; we need to be wary of empirical studies based on circumstances markedly different from the current situation (where households are overleveraged, where interest rates have reached the zero lower bound, etc.). **There were large areas of consensus for the longer run: central banks will focus on more than just inflation, especially financial stability; but there will be a real challenge in developing an integrated approach.** The ultimate objective of a central bank is to stabilize the real economy, and financial and price stability both need to be seen as instruments toward this and other ultimate objectives. In achieving real stability, much stronger financial regulation will be required'both because of agency issues and the pervasiveness of externalities, self-regulation cannot be relied upon. Real stability will require a full range of tools for capital account management, including cross-border regulations on capital flows. While the crisis has brought into focus the inadequacies of the standard macroeconomic models and the policy tenets that were derived from them, not surprisingly other aspects of conventional wisdom, related to growth, were also discussed. Again, there was a surprising consensus that industrial policies have played an important role in enhancing growth (though other policies, like 'rule of law'\u009d and macroeconomic stability are also important). The discussion went well beyond the tired critique of 'picking winners'\u009d to a more insightful analysis, based on the well-known and documented externalities associated with learning and development, instances in which markets on their own do not necessarily work well. Perhaps the major failing of some of the earlier models was that, while the attempt to incorporate micro-foundations was laudable, it was important that they be the right micro-foundations. **This crisis, like so many earlier crises, was a credit crisis; but few of the macroeconomic models modeled credit**; neither banks (perhaps particularly surprising in models used by central banks) nor securitization was typically incorporated into the analysis. While in normal times, credit and money may be highly correlated, this is not so in the usual times surrounding crises, which is when we need to turn to models for guidance. Fortunately, there has been a great deal of modeling of banks and credit creation; the task ahead is to incorporate the insights of these models into the kinds of macro-models being used by policymakers. In any meeting such as this, it's worth noting what was not discussed, or only mentioned briefly. The fact that **countries with central banks that were not independent performed so much better than some of those that were**'partly because the latter were 'cognitively captured'\u009d by the financial markets that they were supposed to regulate'should perhaps lead to rethinking of doctrines concerning central bank independence. **Standard models not only don't provide a good explanation of the origins of a crisis, such as the one Europe and America are experiencing, they also don't adequately explain the slowness of the recovery.** After all, the human and physical assets that existed before the crisis are still here; indeed, in a real sense, having corrected the distortions associated with the crisis, output should be higher. Yet, for years, output has remained substantially below its potential. And it's even the case for the United States, which long prided itself on having flexible labor markets. **Many of those who had been advocates of the old policies, while seeing their limits, cautioned about letting the pendulum swing too far to the other side**: inflation had been a serious problem in the past, so in focusing on other variables, it was important not to lose sight of the risks which high and variable inflation can impose; self-regulation clearly failed, but it can still be part of an overall regulatory scheme; capital flows bring benefits, and these should not be lost sight of. **In short, the conference made an important contribution in invigorating a balanced debate about reforming macroeconomics.** ****************** Other conference-related blog posts: * [The Future of Macroeconomic Policy: Nine Tentative Conclusions, by [Olivier Blanchard * [Rewriting the Macroeconomists' Playbook in the Wake of the Crisis, by [Olivier Blanchard * [An Important Starting Point'with One Gap, by David H.

Listen to the podcast in [English or [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais.) **Governments in Africa have a prime objective'to reduce poverty.** To improve living standards and create jobs, they need to provide their citizens with better health care, better education, more infrastructure. They need to build hospitals, schools, and to pay doctors, nurses, teachers. **All this costs money. How to pay for this'in a way that is both fair and efficient'is a question that all governments face.** There are limits to how much a government can receive as grants from donors or borrow from donors or the private sector. **So raising tax revenues is a necessary element for governments to spend on providing more of these essential services and, in turn, reduce poverty. ****** **Building on progress** While African countries have made important strides in boosting revenue collection in recent years'from around 11\u00c2? percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to 15 percent in 2009'they continue to lag behind most other regions. **Yet African countries that have had successes on this front demonstrate clearly the importance of stronger revenue performance for making in-roads into poverty reduction.** * Take Mozambique, for example. An impressive near **_doubling_** of tax revenues relative to the overall economy since 1992 has allowed substantial increases in social spending with tangible rewards'in increases in enrollment in primary education, better vaccination, and better basic water and sanitation infrastructure. * In Liberia, revenues increased from only 6 percent in GDP to 2003 to 20 percent in 2009, even after a very difficult history of civil war. In addition to significantly better primary enrollment rates, numbers of teachers, and child and the maternal mortality, spending for infrastructure has increased. To help capitalize on country successes such as these, a [conference on_ Revenue Mobilization in Sub-Saharan Africa_ is being co-hosted by the IMF and Kenyan government in Nairobi on March 21-22. **The primary goal is to provide African policymakers with an opportunity to learn from each other, and to identify lessons on what has and has not worked in their efforts to mobilize revenues.**** ** **Priority issues** There are, of course, a wide range of issues for countries to contend with in improving tax revenues, but to help frame the discussion, we see the following as some priority areas for action. First and foremost, countries should avoid taxes that hamper economic development or job creation. Instead they should be designed to be pro- development and pro-jobs. There are two pieces to this puzzle: improving revenue administration; and better tax policy. **1\\. Revenue administration reforms** should concentrate on reducing corruption and addressing the problem of what we call non-compliance. That's when people just don't pay their taxes. As much as half of the tax base is lost because taxpayers escape taxation. **2\\. Tax policy reforms can be incredibly wide-ranging, but here are five issues** to look at: * **First, eliminating tax exemptions.** In African countries these are often quite substantial and can rob the government of quite a bit of revenue, and inevitably they favor some people, which isn't fair. There are also better ways to protect the poor on the spending side, through well-targeted safety nets. * **Second, making value added taxes (VATs), which many countries have, less complicated** through fewer tax rates, fewer exemptions, and a reasonable threshold that keeps small taxpayers out of the VAT system and assures equity across individuals. * **Third, countries need to find ways of compensating for the loss of revenues resulting from trade liberalization,** including trade revenues within customs unions such as in the East African Community where our conference is taking place. * **It's also important to adopt clear laws and regulations that include strong taxpayer protection against harassment from tax officials.** Again, this ensures that taxes are administered equitably. * **Finally, many African countries need to ensure that governments get a fair share when negotiating deals on exploitation of their natural resources**, like oil, natural gas, and minerals. **Ongoing Assistance** The IMF has a long history of providing technical assistance in tax policy and revenue administration in Africa and throughout the world. We will continue to offer assistance to countries in the region, benefiting from the lessons to be drawn in Nairobi. We aim to provide technical assistance that is close to our customers, the governments of the region, through our [regional Technical Assistance Centers'what we call our [AfriTACs. We have three located in Africa and two more will open soon. This Nairobi event coincides with the launch of two [Topical Trust Funds created specifically to support the delivery of IMF technical assistance in tax matters: one in the area of [tax policy and revenue administration, the other for the [management of natural resources. Our discussions in Nairobi will inform a global conference on resource mobilization to be held on April 17'19, 2011 in Washington, DC, and responds to an ongoing initiative by Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market economies on enhancing revenue mobilization in developing countries.

Romer, University of California, Berkeley, and co-host of the Conference on _Macro and Growth Policies in the Wake of the Crisis_ **I had one major source of unhappiness with last week's [conference: the participants were largely silent about the dismal outlook in the advanced economies for the next several years.** The current outlook for unemployment in the United States, Europe, and Japan is probably worse than it was in late 2008. Then, mainstream forecasts for 2009'2011 showed unemployment rising sharply'but generally to levels below what we are experiencing today'and then returning toward normal at a moderate pace. Today, not only is unemployment higher than most 2008 forecasts of its peak levels, but the expected pace of recovery is weaker. Despite this deterioration, the dire sense of urgency in late 2008 has not increased. Indeed, it has largely disappeared. **I find this complacency in the fact of vast, preventable suffering and waste hard to understand.** With the exception of that one critical omission, I was impressed by the discussion.** One striking feature was the consensus that there is no consensus. That is, no one argued that there was widespread agreement about a simple set of rules for achieving macroeconomic stability, robust growth, and shared prosperity. **Indeed, no one proposed such a set of rules. The crisis has, appropriately, made macroeconomists and policymakers humble about what we know. Although we must continue to give the best policy advice we can, **this is also a time for intensive thought and research. I found the conference to be a valuable contribution to that process.** And I thought that the fact that it was the IMF that organized the conference'and, especially, the wide range of perspectives of the people it invited to participate'reflects very well on the institution. It is a sign that the Fund understands that it does not have all the answers, and that it needs to look broadly in its efforts to rethink issues that were widely viewed as settled just a few years ago. **On some specific issues, there was, if not unanimity, considerable agreement**: * Because of asymmetric information, agency problems, and behavioral forces, financial markets do not reliably produce efficient outcomes. Moreover, even well conceived and well implemented microeconomic regulation cannot ensure that financial market imperfections will not lead to adverse macroeconomic outcomes. Thus there is a need for '[macro-prudential regulation'\u009d'that is, regulation and supervision that address financial risks to the macroeconomy. * The idea of 'the'\u009d fiscal multiplier is not sensible. The impact of a change in fiscal policy is extremely dependent on whether monetary policy is able to respond, and on how it responds if it can. The impact also depends on the state of the economy, the health of the financial system, the time horizon of the change, its specific form, and more. * Capital controls should be part of the macroeconomic toolkit. Even speakers who were skeptical of capital controls thought there were circumstances under which they were a reasonable short-term expedient. And others felt they were a fully appropriate response to the prospect of large inflows of short-term capital that could lead to substantial overvaluation of the exchange rate. * The simple 'one instrument/one target'\u009d view of monetary policy (where the instrument is a short-term interest rate and the target is inflation, or a weighted average of inflation and the output gap) is too simple. There are other instruments (exchange market intervention, capital controls, margin requirements, down payment requirements, capital requirements, and more), and other potential targets (notably the exchange rate and indicators of financial risks). * Having a domestic central bank'specifically, the U.S. Federal Reserve'be the main provider of emergency liquidity to central banks around the world, as occurred in 2008 through swap lines, does not seem optimal. Finding an arrangement where an international body plays that role would be desirable. The discussion that was started at this conference needs to continue. We, the conference co-hosts, hope to hear your comments. ****************** Other conference-related blog posts by [Olivier Blanchard: * [The Future of Macroeconomic Policy: Nine Tentative Conclusions * [Rewriting the Macroeconomists' Playbook in the Wake of the Crisis ", "index": 644}, {"pub": "3/13/2011", "title": "The Future of Macroeconomic Policy: Nine Tentative Conclusions", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2726", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard (Version in [Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, [Espa\u00c3?ol) **The global economic crisis taught us to question our most cherished beliefs about the way we conduct macroeconomic policy. **Earlier I [had put forward some ideas to help guide conversations as we reexamine these beliefs. I was heartened by the wide online debate and the excellent discussions at a conference on post-crisis macroeconomic policy here in Washington last week. **At the end of the [conference, I organized my concluding thoughts around [nine points. **Let me go through them and see whether you agree or not. 1\\. **We've entered a brave new world in the wake of the crisis; a very different world in terms of policy making** and we just have to accept it. 2\\. **In the age-old discussion of the relative roles of markets and the state, the pendulum has swung'at least a bit'toward the state.** 3\\. **The crisis made it clear that there are many distortions relevant for macroeconomics, many more than we thought earlier.** We had ignored them, thinking they were the province of the micro-economist. As we integrate finance into macroeconomics, we're discovering distortions within finance are macro-relevant. Agency theory'about incentives and behavior of entities or \"agents\"'is needed to explain how financial institutions work or do not work and how decisions are taken. Regulation and agency theory applied to regulators is important. Behavioral economics and its cousin, behavioral finance, are central as well. 4\\. **Macroeconomic policy has many targets and many instruments** (that is, the tools we use or variables to implement policy). There are many examples of this that were discussed at the [conference, but here are two. * Monetary policy has to go beyond inflation stability, adding output and financial stability to the list of targets, and adding [macro-prudential measures to the list of instruments. * Fiscal policy is more than just 'G minus T'\u009d and an associated \"multiplier\" (the proportion or factor by which changes in government spending or taxes affect other parts of the economy). There are potentially dozens of instruments, each with their own dynamic effects that depend on the state of the economy and other policies. Bob Solow made the point that reducing discussions about fiscal policy to what is the right multiplier does not do service to the issue. 5\\. **We may have many policy instruments, but we are not sure how to use them. **In many cases, we are uncertain about what they are, how they should be used, and whether or not they will work. Again, many examples came up during the [conference. * We don't quite know what liquidity is, so a **liquidity ratio** is one more step into the unknown. * It was clear that some people believe **capital controls** work and some don't. * [Paul Romer made the point that, if you adopt a set of **financial regulations** and keep them unchanged, the markets will find a way around, and ten years later, you'll have a financial crisis. * [Mike Spence talked about the relative roles of **self-regulation and regulation**. Both are needed, but how we combine them is extremely unclear. 6\\. **While these instruments are potentially useful, their use raises a number of political economy issues.** * **Some instruments are politically hard to use.** Take cross border flows. Putting in place a multilateral regulatory structure will be very difficult. Even at the domestic level, some macro-prudential tools work by targeting specific sectors, sets of individuals, or firms, and may lead to strong political backlash by those groups. * **Instruments can be misused. **The more there are, the more the scope for misuse. It was clear from the discussion that a number of people think that, while there may be an economic case for capital controls, governments could use them instead of choosing the right macroeconomic policies. Dani Rodrik argued for using industrial policy to increase the production of tradables'goods or services that can be traded among countries'without getting a current account surplus. But in practice we know the limits of industrial policy, and they haven't gone away. 7\\. **Where do we go from here? In terms of research, the future is exciting. **There are many topics on which we should work'namely macro issues with, as Joe Stiglitz said, the right micro foundations. 8\\. **Things are harder on the policy front. Given we don't quite know how to use the new tools and they can be misused, how should policymakers proceed?** While we have a good sense of where we want to get to, a step-by-step approach is the way to do it. * Take inflation targeting. We can't, from one day to the next, just give it up and have, say, a system with five targets and seven instruments. We don't know how to do it and it would be unwise. We can, however, introduce gradually some [macro-prudential tools, testing the water to see how they work. * Increasing the role of [Special Drawing Rights in the [international monetary system is another example. If we go in that direction, we can move slowly from, say, creating a market in private SDR bonds to exploring the possibility for the IMF to issue SDR bonds to the private sector and then, if feasible, issuing them to mobilize funds in times of systemic crisis. **Pragmatism is of the essence.** This was a general theme that came up, for example, in [Andrew Sheng's discussion of the adaptive Chinese growth model. We have to try things carefully and see how they work. 9\\. **We have to keep our hopes in check.** There are going to be new crises that we have not anticipated. And, despite our best efforts, we could have old-type crises again. That was a theme in [Adair Turner's discussion of credit cycles. Can we, using agency theory and the right regulations, get rid of credit cycles? Or is it basic human nature that, no matter what we do, they will come back in some form? **I was asked whether the conference was \"[Washington Consensus 2\". It was not intended to be and it was not. The conference was the beginning of a conversation, the beginning of an exploration, and we look forward to your contributions.** ", "index": 645}, {"pub": "3/9/2011", "title": "No End in Sight: Early Lessons on Crisis Management", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2705", "content": " [[[By [Stijn Claessens and [Ceyla Pazarbasioglu (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) **Crises are like stories; they have a beginning, middle, and an end, and on occasion, we learn something along the way.** In times of crisis, choices must be made. In the most recent global economic crisis policymakers moved quickly to stabilize the system, providing massive financial support, which is the right response in the beginning of any crisis. **But that only treated the symptoms of the global financial meltdown, and now a rare opportunity is being thrown away to tackle the underlying causes. ** Without restructuring financial institutions' balance sheets and their operations, as well as their assets ' loans to over-indebted households and enterprises ' **the economic recovery will suffer, and the seeds will be sown for the next crisis. ** In our new [paper we analyze the policy choices made during the crisis and compare them to a number of past ones. It turns out the phases of this crisis followed the same pattern as previous ones, but policymakers made different choices this time around. This has a lot to do with the distinct nature of this crisis; unlike those in the last 20 years, it was truly global and more complex to handle because financial institutions and markets are larger and more interconnected than ever before. **Lesson # 1** - **All choices have a cost, some with long term effects ** The complexity and severity of the recent crisis justified a rapid response to contain risks and restore confidence. While less deep restructuring early on lowered the costs in the short term, there may be higher costs in the years ahead. In particular, the policy mix chosen precluded thorough due diligence, and may reduce incentives to restructure assets. The risk is that, instead of a policy of triage, diagnosis-based resolution, and early asset restructuring, a muddling-through approach prevails. This approach, including accounting and regulatory forbearance, guarantees, and implicit public support stalls addressing nonviable banks and nonperforming assets. Many of the structural characteristics that contributed to the build-up of systemic risks are still in place today, and moral hazard has increased. In most countries, the structure of the financial system has changed little. In fact, concentration often has increased'on average for the 12 crisis countries we examined, the assets of the five largest banks have gone from 307 to 335 percent of GDP'as large banks acquired failing institutions. This complicates resolution efforts. The large-scale public support provided to institutions and markets'a contingent liability equivalent to one-fourth of GDP at the peak of the crisis'has exacerbated perceptions of too-important-to-fail. **Lesson #2 ' Find out what you don't know and fix what you can** Diagnose the problem to learn about the viability of financial institutions and support only those that are viable, and close or restructure the nonviable ones. Stress tests were conducted and the results published in the U.S. and in Europe in May 2009, and July 2010 respectively, but only after initial government recapitalization. While these stress tests restored short term investor confidence, their long term impact has been uneven, especially in Europe, in part due to different financial market perceptions about the credibility of assumptions used and remedial actions announced in conjunction, and subsequent events. As a result, European authorities have been compelled to engage in a new round of stress tests. **Lesson #3 ' Create a global playbook** Restructuring the global financial system requires tools and policies that, just like banks, reach across country borders. It will also require policymakers to cooperate globally, just as they did at the peak of the crisis. Since the crisis, several countries have adopted more effective resolution schemes for large financial institutions, which should allow future losses to be borne by uninsured creditors. But many countries still lag in this respect, including in how to allocate losses. The new resolution schemes remain untested to deal with failures of large cross-border institutions, and much more needs to be done to enhance the supervision of cross-border exposures and related risks. **The end of this story hasn't been written yet, and we shouldn't throw away the opportunity to change the way the global financial system operates for years to come.** ", "index": 646}, {"pub": "3/4/2011", "title": "Rewriting the Macroeconomists\u2019 Playbook in the Wake of the Crisis", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2662", "content": " [By [Olivier Blanchard **Before the global economic crisis, mainstream macroeconomists had largely converged on a framework for the conduct of macroeconomic policy. The framework was elegant, and conceptually simple. **Caricaturing just a bit, it went like this: * The essential goal of monetary policy was low and stable inflation. The best way to achieve it was to follow an interest rate rule. If designed right, the rule was not only credible, but delivered stable inflation and ensured that output was as close as it could be to its potential. * This was achieved by setting the key policy rate that then affected the term structure of interest rates and asset prices, and then to aggregate demand. One could safely ignore most of the details of financial intermediation. Financial regulation was outside the macroeconomic policy framework. * On currencies, countries could set an inflation target and float, or instead choose a hard currency peg or join common currency areas. In general, in a world in which central banks followed inflation targeting, there was no particular reason to worry about the level of the exchange rate or the current account balance. Certainly, attempting to control exchange rates through capital controls was undesirable. And multilateral coordination was not required. * Fiscal policy had a limited role at best, at least in the short run. With the right use of monetary policy, it was not really needed. Automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment benefits, would kick in during downturns, but discretionary policy was more likely to be misused than used well. The focus had to be on the medium run, and on fiscal sustainability. **These were simple principles, and they seemed to work. **From the early 1980s on, macroeconomic fluctuations were increasingly muted, and the period became known as the 'Great Moderation'\u009d.** Then the crisis came. If nothing else, it forces us to do a [wholesale reexamination of those principles.** Here are some ideas to guide the conversation: * **Economic imbalances:** Achieving stable inflation is good, but we can now see it does not guarantee stable output. Before the crisis, steady output growth and stable inflation hid growing imbalances in the composition of output and in the balance sheets of households, firms, and financial institutions, as well as growing misalignments of asset prices. These imbalances ended up being very costly. The question now is how best to address such imbalances. Should we think of macroeconomic policy as having three legs'monetary, fiscal, and financial'each with separate authorities? Or should we think of extending both the mandate and the set of tools of monetary policy to cover both output and financial stability? And, if so, what tools do we have and how do we use them? * **Interest rates:** Early in the crisis, central banks decreased policy rates, until they reached their lower bound''namely zero. From then on, interest rate policy could not be used to prop up aggregate demand, and central banks turned to both credit and quantitative easing. This raises many questions. First, would it have helped if nominal interest rates had been higher to start, giving more margin of maneuver to central banks? Put another way, should we revisit the low inflation targets, and the associated low average nominal interest rates, that central banks had adopted pre crisis? Second, are credit and quantitative easing policies just for exceptional times, or can they work and do they make sense in more tranquil times? * **Fiscal policy:** When interest rates reached the lower bound, fiscal policy came back to the fore. Going beyond automatic stabilizers, most countries adopted fiscal stimulus programs to increase aggregate demand, but debates about the size and even the sign of multipliers associated with different fiscal measures made clear how little work had been done on fiscal policy, and how much needed to be done. The large increase in debt since the beginning of the crisis (an increase which is overwhelmingly due to the loss of output and the implied loss in revenues rather than to the fiscal stimulus programs themselves) also raises many issues. Even though it will be a long time before debt levels are reduced sufficiently, what levels of public debt should countries aim for? Are old rules of thumb, such as trying to keep the debt to GDP ratio below 60 percent in advanced countries, still reliable? * **Capital flows:** The crisis triggered very large capital flows. Often, these flows had little to do with conditions in the country that they left, and more to do with the need by foreign financial institutions to repatriate funds in a hurry. More recently, capital has gone back to emerging market countries, sometimes with such force as to trigger complaints of 'currency wars,' leading to intense discussions about capital account management. How should countries react to large capital inflows? If they want to mute their effect for example, when should they build up reserves and when should they use capital controls? Should each country be left to do what it feels is best for itself, or should there be international rules of good behavior? * **International monetary system:** Talking about international rules of good behavior, the crisis raises both old and new questions about the international monetary system. Should benign neglect determine the coordination of monetary policies across countries? Should there be international rules not only with respect to capital controls, but with respect to reserve management, and monetary policy in general? Should countries be free to run the current account deficits or surpluses they want, or should there be restrictions on what they should do? Before the crisis, a number of emerging market countries had relied on low exchange rates and export-led growth. As these countries get larger and the competitiveness effect on other countries becomes more visible, does export-led growth remain an acceptable strategy for a multilateral point of view? * **Safety net:** In a different dimension, the great recession has showed that not only emerging countries, but also advanced countries, can suffer sudden stops. During the crisis, foreign liquidity was provided mostly through swap lines offered by the major central banks. Since then, the IMF has created two new liquidity windows. Is the problem solved, or is more needed? [**These questions, and many more, will keep us busy for years to come. To take stock of the questions, and start exploring the answers, David Romer, Michael Spence, Joseph Stiglitz, and I have organized a conference on these issues.** This conference will take place on March 7 and 8 at the IMF. While the conference is by invitation only due to space constraints, it will be webcast live. To follow it, and get more information please visit the [conference website. After the conference, we shall open a discussion site, and continue the discussion online.

But, faced with new challenges, the question is: how best to sustain this progress?** As I travel through the region this week'visiting Panama, Uruguay, and Brazil'I'm looking forward to hearing the views of government officials, parliamentarians, and university students on the key challenges facing their countries today. Here are three questions that I look forward to discussing during my trip. **First, as the region enjoys a time of abundance'_una \u00c3\u00a9poca de vacas gordas_'can there be too much of a good thing?** Latin America's economies are growing rapidly, buoyed by good access to external financing and high commodity prices. But potentially worrying signs of overheating are popping up'rising inflation, rapidly growing credit, and booming stock markets. We all know how this story can end if policymakers don't act early enough to prevent boom from turning into bust. Guiding their economies to a soft landing may be the most important near-term challenge facing policymakers in Latin America today. Withdrawing the macroeconomic stimulus adopted during the global crisis should be the first step'and some countries are already doing so. Countries should probably begin with fiscal policy, to reduce the burden on monetary policy. In some cases, however, rising inflationary pressure calls for action now on both the fiscal _and_ the monetary fronts. Exchange rate flexibility is also important. In the current setting, appreciation can help temper capital inflows, by making foreign investors think twice about future exchange rate risk. To protect financial stability, prudential measures may need to be tightened. Finally, while capital controls may be useful temporarily in some cases, they should not be considered a substitute for macro or prudential measures. **Second, are countries equipped to handle future times of lean'_la \u00c3\u00a9poca de vacas flacas_?** With the global financial crisis only just receding in the rear-view mirror, it may seem premature to think about possible future shocks. But the global economy remains exposed to downside risks, and it is always good to be prepared for a possible change in the economic weather. Latin America's experience during the crisis'bouncing back from it much better than most other regions'shows the benefit of building policy buffers and reducing vulnerabilities in times of plenty. Over the last decade, countries across the region have strengthened their policy frameworks, lowered public debt, increased foreign reserve buffers, allowed greater exchange rate flexibility, and improved financial supervision and regulation. These all played a role in the region's success. What about the road ahead? Let me mention two areas where countries in Latin America'and indeed around the world'would do well to focus their efforts. First, fiscal space. One of the most important lessons of the global financial crisis is that economies with healthier public finances had more room to offset the impact of the crisis, and to protect the most vulnerable. Going forward, countries should rebuild fiscal space'and in fact go even farther, where needed, to bring debts down to safe levels. Panama is one of the Latin American countries already working in this direction**_._** Second, financial stability. We also learned from the crisis how quickly seemingly isolated financial problems can engulf the entire financial system, affect the broader economy, and spread across national boundaries. We need better tools to monitor risks both within and across institutions. Regulators and supervisors should be empowered to take early preventive action. Indeed, a number of countries in Latin America'including Brazil'are already strengthening macroprudential financial regulations. **Finally, how best to share these times of plenty'across society, and with future generations? ****_Como compartir'y prolongar'la \u00c3\u00a9poca de las vacas gordas_****_?_** The region has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decade, lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty. In Uruguay, for example, the poverty rate has fallen by a remarkable 10 percentage points since 2004. Today, the challenge for the region is to embark on the next stage of its transformation'reforms are needed to sustain strong growth for generations to come, and allow the fruits of growth to be shared across all members of society. Reforms that boost productivity'such as revitalizing infrastructure and improving education and training'are clearly essential. Improving the business climate and strengthening governance are also important for a pro-growth strategy. But growth for growth's sake is not enough. The region remains profoundly unequal, with about a third of its people living in poverty. Leaders across the region are rightly committed to tackling this problem. And making the social safety net more effective is an important part of the strategy. Here, innovative conditional cash transfer programs'for example, Brazil's _bolsa familia_ program'are playing an important role, and are in fact being emulated around the world. Raising social spending and improving the quality of service delivery'in education, health, and public infrastructure'are also key priorities. Latin America has come a long way over the last decade. But the region's transformation is not yet complete. **Leaders across the region should capitalize on today's favorable conditions, transforming their countries to the next level, and ensuring that the benefits of growth are more widely shared.** ", "index": 648}, {"pub": "2/24/2011", "title": "Unleashing Growth Potential in the Middle East", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2623", "content": " [By [Masood Ahmed Recent popular protests in the Middle East and North Africa region, although likely to have a negative economic impact in the short run, might actually help to unleash the countries' long-term growth potential. **By providing the impetus for reforms, these events may encourage better governance, greater transparency, and more competition**'in other words, tackling many of the constraints that have held back progress in these societies.

Left unresolved, these problems could even sow the seeds of the next crisis. **So, there is good reason to think that [reforms to the IMS that help us get to the root of these imbalances could both bolster the recovery and strengthen the system's ability to prevent future crises. ** Let me set out three key questions that are guiding the [IMF's work in this area. **First, how can we strengthen policy cooperation and reduce volatility?** **The crisis marked a watershed moment for international policy cooperation'leaders took the actions necessary to overcome domestic _and _global economic challenges.** Now that the worst of the crisis has passed, how can we sustain this cooperation'so that countries adopt policies consistent with less volatile global growth? **The [G-20's Mutual Assessment Process**** has been an important first step towards creating a more permanent framework for global policy cooperation.** IMF surveillance is a critical complement to the MAP'and also lies at the core of our mandate. Through this activity, the IMF seeks to identify the country-level policies that can deliver more stable global growth. **We have also strengthened Fund surveillance**'for example, the [early warning and vulnerability exercises. We are now increasing our focus on the impact of countries' policies across their borders, particularly for the five most systemic economies'for which we have new dedicated 'spillover reports'\u009d in preparation. At the same time, we are delving deeper into macro-financial linkages. For the world's 25 most systemic financial systems, Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) are becoming mandatory. This tool will facilitate our efforts to catch dangerous build-ups of systemic risk in the financial sector'which is precisely what preceded the recent crisis. Beyond this, we should explore whether even more ambitious changes to our surveillance are needed'and we are conducting a major review to that effect. **My second question is: how best to cope with capital flow and exchange rate volatility?** **Over the past decade, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the size and volatility of capital flows. Broadly speaking, such flows are beneficial to the receiving economies. But they can also complicate macroeconomic management and threaten financial stability. ** So, what are the tools? They are many, including macroeconomic adjustment, reserve accumulation, prudential measures and'when all this is put in place and still a country experiences some disruptive inflows'capital controls. Naturally, countries' responses are driven primarily by domestic considerations. But their actions can have consequences for the rest of the world. **Given these spillovers, should we have globally agreed 'rules of the road'\u009d for managing capital flows?** Our members have asked us to look into this question, and we expect to present some concrete ideas in the near future. **A related issue is the volatility of exchange rates.** The major currencies have fluctuated widely vis-\u00c3 -vis each other and have not moved consistently in a direction promoting an orderly adjustment of imbalances. Large and persistent deviations of exchange rates from fundamentals can result in significant systemic distortions, which can be particularly problematic for small open economies. **Addressing this issue requires setting economic and financial policies that promote global balance and reduce the volatility of capital flows**, as I have just discussed. **My third and final question: how can we enhance liquidity provision in times of extreme volatility?** **Since the crisis, we have come a long way in strengthening the global financial safety net.** The Fund's resource base has been increased significantly, and our financing toolkit has been made more flexible, in particular by adding the [Flexible Credit Line and the Precautionary Credit Line. But many countries remain to be convinced that the global financial safety net is strong enough to deal with the next crisis'and so the costly accumulation of reserves continues well in excess of precautionary needs. What else can be done? **One important avenue is to strengthen partnerships with regional financing arrangements.** Another is how to improve the predictability of systemic liquidity provision more generally'as opposed to leaving this task to national central banks. A complementary question is how best to gauge the adequacy of precautionary reserves, and which benchmarks to use. **Over time, there may also be a **[**role for the SDR**** to contribute to a more stable IMS. **A [paper the IMF is releasing today presents a range of ideas on this topic. But, increasing the role of the SDR would clearly require a major leap in international policy coordination. For this reason, the global reserve asset system will evolve only gradually, along with changes in the global economy, and at a pace that is not disruptive. **Let me wrap up. **Reform of the IMS is wide-ranging and complex. Global debate is only just starting. But we must all recognize that this is not something academic or abstract. We need concrete ideas. This is linked to achieving the kind of well-balanced and sustainable recovery that the world needs'and it is linked to preventing the next crisis.

On the one hand, providing access to affordable health care is of paramount importance. But spending on health care is putting enormous pressure on public purses all over the world, and it's only getting worse. **How can we fix this? How can governments keep their health care promises to citizens without busting the budget? A [recent paper by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department tries to help with these choices, presenting public health spending projections for fifty advanced and emerging countries, and posing reform options. ## **_Advanced economies_** Let's start with the basics. **In advanced economies, health care spending alone accounted for about half of the rise in government budgets in the past 40 years. If we do nothing, these costs will continue to soar. **Public health spending is projected to climb by 3 percentage points of GDP over the next 20 years in the advanced economies. The increases in health spending are driven by population aging but more importantly by technical progress and the availability of better and more expensive technologies. This is simply not affordable. **Reforms are needed to control spending, but these reforms must also be equitable, protecting access to basic health care for all who need it, especially the poor.** The situation appears dire, but there are options. Past experience suggests that reforms can help slow the growth of spending in an efficient and equitable manner. We find that the most promising reform strategies combine top-down budget control and bottom-up reforms to improve efficiency. **Budget systems that cap total health expenditures and impose a high degree of central oversight can provide powerful incentives for expenditure restraint.** Among the countries with a history of the lowest increases public spending, Italy, Japan, and Sweden have a greater reliance on budget caps. **Bottom-up reforms help control costs by enhancing efficiency. This allows more and better service delivery to patients for a given amount of resources. **Some examples include: * _Strengthening market mechanisms_: increasing patient choice of insurers, allowing greater competition between insurers and providers, and relying on a greater degree of private sector provision (e.g. Germany and Japan). * _Changing the way doctors and hospitals are paid_: moving away from reimbursement to providers after services are rendered (fee for service) towards more sophisticated management and contracting systems. These systems include built-in incentives for providers to minimize waste and improve services (e.g. Germany and Italy). * _Greater reliance on private insurance_ can also help slow down the growth of public health spending (e.g. ", "index": 652}, {"pub": "2/1/2011", "title": "The Long and the Short of It\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Government Debt Plans in 2011 and Beyond", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2461", "content": " [By [Carlo Cottarelli (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) As we said in the just-published [_Fiscal Monitor_ update, **fiscal policy this year in some leading advanced economies is shaping up to be quite different from what was expected just last November**. The United States and Japan are delaying their earlier plans to reduce their public deficits, choosing instead to provide further support to their economies. The change in plans is even more remarkable if you look at the cyclically adjusted balance. You can see this in the charts. **Some of the change in the fiscal stance with respect to our earlier projections is attributable to the somewhat better than projected fiscal results in 2010, a point to which I will return in a moment. Most of it, however, is due to additional stimulus measures introduced during the last two months. **These two countries need to strengthen their fiscal adjustment credentials by detailing the measures they will adopt to lower deficits and debt over the medium term. **So, what happened last year?** For advanced economies, fiscal developments in 2010 were slightly better on average'by about 0.3 percent of GDP'than we had estimated in the November 2010 [_Fiscal Monito_r, although with some more sizable differences for individual countries. [ **The average 2010 fiscal deficit in emerging economies was broadly unchanged from our November estimates, again with notable country differences. Yet, here the unchanged deficit number masks some important underlying developments. ** * On the positive side, revenue growth has been solid, reflecting higher commodity prices and asset prices, to some extent reflecting strong capital inflows. * But it is troubling that these revenues have in several countries been used to finance higher spending. This is happening in Latin America, for example, and is something that needs to be watched. It is likely that some of this revenue increase will prove to be transitory, but the spending it has paid for may not be so. **[** **Different countries, different plans** **No amount of deficit reduction this year, however, can be sufficient to restore countries' fiscal accounts to robust good health. Putting the government accounts in order will require a multi-year effort. ** How are countries doing in setting out their longer-term plans? Here, there is again somewhat of a mixed picture. The fiscal commission in the United States did a wonderful job to come up with comprehensive and sound proposals on how to reduce the deficit in the medium term. We hope that their recommendations will not be lost despite their failure to achieve the supermajority needed to submit their proposal to Congress. In this respect, we welcome the emphasis in President Obama's State of the Union address earlier this week on broad-based fiscal reforms, including discretionary spending restraint as well as revenue measures and entitlement reforms (most critically, health care spending). We look forward to reviewing the U.S. Administration's specific proposals in the forthcoming budget. In Europe, changes have mainly been institutional in nature. Again some have been positive and others not. The main change has been the decision by the European Council to create a permanent crisis management and resolution arrangement. At a country level, however, the Monitor notes some weakening of fiscal institutions in Hungary where a non-partisan fiscal watchdog was effectively closed. **Altogether, sovereign risks remain elevated and in some cases have increased since November 2010.

So, **where does the global financial system stand at the moment?** Yes, we have witnessed improvements recently, but we are also observing a dichotomy between the economy and the financial system. While the global economic recovery has been continuing, **financial stability is still at risk, because of a persistent lack of investor confidence in some advanced country sovereigns and their banking systems**. At this cross-roads, we see **three key messages**. * First, more than three years after the onset of the **financial crisis, global financial stability is still not assured**. * Second, **policymakers need to step up their efforts to tackle pressing policy challenges**, such as sovereign risk, banking system vulnerabilities, and increased global capital flows. * Third, we need to **press ahead with structural solutions to longstanding financial problems**. **_Financial stability challenges_** I would like to elaborate further on the **key challenges that keep global financial stability at risk**. **First, in light of high public debt levels, market concerns about sovereign risk have persisted** and have spilled over to a greater number of countries, mostly in the euro area. At the same time, we have seen an increasingly negative interaction'an adverse feedback'between banking and sovereign credit risks in some euro area countries. In other words, the fate of some banks is now increasingly intertwined with that of their sovereign'and vice versa. **Second, fragilities remain in key parts of several banking systems.** * **Markets are questioning the quality of many bank assets**, reflecting concerns about banks' exposure to countries facing sovereign pressures, and concerns about exposure to real estate loans. * **Banks also face significant funding needs over the next two years**. During that period, sovereigns will also need to refinance _their_ debt, creating competition for limited funding resources. * **Many banks still need to raise their capital levels.** They also need to **improve the quality of their capital** to reassure investors and to meet the more stringent Basel III standards. The challenges facing banks'if left unresolved'would hinder the provision of credit to companies and households and would hurt the global economic recovery. **And third, there is the challenge of coping with the rapid rebound in capital inflows into emerging market economies.** While capital flows are generally beneficial for recipient countries, rapid and strong inflows can fuel asset price bubbles and strain the absorptive capacity of local financial systems. Although we appear to be at the early stages of such a cycle, policymakers need to be vigilant about these risks. **_Policy priorities_** **So, what policies should be put in place to meet these challenges?** In advanced countries, we **need to deal with the legacy of the crisis** by resolving financial fragilities'**once and for all!** **In Europe, policymakers need to break the adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and banks**. * **Sovereign risk should be contained** through credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies. * **In addition, the financial system should be repaired** through a comprehensive plan to reduce uncertainty about banks and help restore investor confidence. This plan should include the following elements: improved bank transparency; greater firepower for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF); a decisive pursuit of recapitalization and restructuring of banks; and better economic governance for the European Union. **In the United States,** * **Policymakers must put in place a credible strategy for medium-term fiscal consolidation to avoid a potential, sharp rise in long-term interest rates. ** * Increased efforts are also needed to address the effects of the **still-damaged real estate markets on banks**. **In emerging markets, policymakers must act now to avoid future crises.** It is important to maintain the appropriate mix of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies to deal with the challenges posed by capital inflows. In addition, local capital markets will need to become deeper and more resilient, for example through improved market infrastructures. **There is also a need to ensure continued progress on the global financial policy agenda**. Financial systems everywhere need to adapt to cope with regulatory reform. New regulations need to be adopted consistently across the world, including on systemically important financial institutions and the so-called 'shadow'\u009d banking sector. Supervision and bank resolution regimes need to work more effectively within' and across'national borders to safeguard financial stability. **Time is of the essence** in addressing immediate policy challenges'particularly in the euro area'and finding a better balance between macroeconomic and structural financial policies. Without these timely policy responses, global financial stability and sustainable growth will remain elusive.

But it remains a two-speed recovery:** slow in advanced countries, and much faster in emerging and developing economies. As a result, tensions and risks are emerging, which require strong policy responses. **_The outlook_** For some time, global activity was led by fiscal stimulus and the restocking of inventories. This process is now essentially over, which means that **global growth is set to slow over the coming year. Fortunately, underlying private demand is improving, so we expect the slowdown to be modest**, with global growth remaining at 4.4 percent in 2011, down from 5 percent in 2010. **In emerging and developing countries, growth is likely to remain strong**. Gross Domestic Product for this group of countries should increase by 6.5 percent in 2011, compared with 7.1 percent in 2010. Most emerging and developing economies have few scars from the crisis, and some'such as South Africa, where we launched _[our latest World Economic Outlook update_ today'are benefiting from strong commodity prices. **In many emerging market countries, output is now back to potential and the policy challenge is to avoid overheating.** **Economic growth in advanced countries however, growth will remain subdued**. We anticipate 2.5 percent growth in 2011, compared to 3 percent in 2010. **This is barely enough to dent high unemployment, and this raises clear social concerns.** These countries still need to work off their pre-crisis excesses, and to fully repair their financial systems. Many are also facing fiscal challenges, most pressingly in the euro area. **Meanwhile, little progress is being made in addressing global imbalances**. We expect that growth in the U.S. will be based on domestic demand, while net exports deteriorate. One may worry that the U.S. will replicate the type of growth it had before the crisis, with public dissaving taking the role that low private saving used to play. Similarly, without fundamental changes in China, we expect the current account surplus there to rebound from its lower level this year. **_Tensions and risks_** **In the short term, this uneven global recovery is creating four main tensions and risks. ** **The first is rising commodity prices.** In fact, the problem is not quite as severe as headlines would suggest, as actual prices remain below their pre-crisis peaks. Moreover, food price increases have been driven mainly by one time supply-side factors, and the effects should wind down over the course of 2011. However, oil price pressures are different. They come from the demand side. In the second half of last year, unexpected consumption growth of 2 percent resulted in a price increase of roughly 10 percent. Strong world growth is likely to be associated with further increases, with important implications for emerging and developing economies. **The second is capital flows into emerging markets.** Here again, the problem is not quite as bad as the headlines would suggest. Inflows have definitely increased, but for most countries, they remain below previous peaks and have actually been receding in the last couple of months. This recent decrease actually suggests that the U.S. Fed's QE2 may not be having the impact that many emerging markets anticipated. Nevertheless, these flows raise difficult policy choices, from the degree to which countries should allow for currency appreciation, to the respective roles of macroeconomic policy, macro prudential tools, and capital controls. **Third are the risks in 'peripheral'\u009d Europe.** In some of these countries, the macro and fiscal adjustment is likely to be a long and painful one. Markets consequently worry that implementation could go off track, leading to concerns about sovereign debt, and in turn to concerns about banks. They also worry that problems could travel in the other direction, from banks to sovereigns. **Fourth are the risks associated with continuing global imbalances.** What will happen if such rebalancing does not take place? Absent an improvement in net exports, growth is likely to remain subdued in the U.S., making it difficult to withdraw the fiscal stimulus. But if stimulus is not withdrawn, the long-term fiscal challenges will intensify. Either way, there will eventually be problems down the line, not only for the U.S. but, by implication, also for the rest of the world. **_Three-pronged policy strategy_** **So, what needs to be done, to reduce risks and strengthen the global recovery? A three-pronged strategy is necessary: ** * In many emerging and developing countries, **macroeconomic policies need to shift so as to avoid overheating.** * **In 'peripheral'\u009d Europe, some measures must be taken urgently**, among them clarifying the exposures of banks, backed by recapitalization schemes if and where needed (as outlined in the IMF's [update of global financial stability). Otherwise, it is important to 'give time to time'\u009d. That is, since fiscal and structural adjustments will take time, it is important to take panic scenarios out of the picture. This means that **current fiscal and macroeconomic commitments must be backed by deeds, adequate multilateral funding if and where needed, and ECB liquidity.** * **Finally, the world needs to reduce global imbalances. For China and other surplus countries, this involves structural reforms and currency appreciation. For the U.S. and other advanced countries, this involves fiscal consolidation. **In that respect, many advanced countries, including the U.S., have not yet put in place a credible medium term fiscal adjustment plan, and this is urgently needed.

Cubeddu and [Camilo E. Tovar (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol) Many Latin American economies are booming due to strong inflows of capital and stronger export earnings from high commodity prices. Though favorable today, this situation is also a double-edged sword. Households, companies, and banks are spurred to take on financial risk. But, **if risks become excessive or poorly managed, they sow the seeds of future problems. **The region has experienced firsthand the boom and bust cycles that can ensue, and there is consensus that this needs to be avoided or minimized in the future. The IMF's two latest _Regional Economic Outlooks_ for the region'published in [May and [October 2010'focused on precisely this issue. **While the bottom line is the need for effective macroeconomic policy management and implementation, information is an essential ingredient. ** Countries in Latin America have made good progress in strengthening statistics. Yet, we see three main areas that are particularly relevant for monitoring the accumulation of risks and potential overheating, that are not yet sufficiently well-developed, namely: credit conditions surveys, housing price indicators, and data on the financing structure of companies. **1\\. Credit conditions surveys** The first area for action concerns **surveys on** **credit conditions of financial intermediaries.** These seek to answer questions such as: * How restrictive or lax are loan approval standards? * What factors explain the changes observed in bank behavior? * What is the role of the economic environment or of changes in customer portfolio risk? **These types of surveys serve an important role.** The information compiled complements the data captured through the analysis of interest rates, intermediation margins, and lending volumes, and can be used as a tool to determine whether demand (changes in the credit appetite of customers) or supply (decisions taken by banks) is driving changes in lending levels. In addition, such surveys are very [useful for forecasting changes in the economic cycle. [Despite their usefulness, these surveys have only recently come into widespread use in advanced economies. At present, very few emerging economies produce such surveys and, in Latin America, only Chile and Colombia prepare them on a regular basis (see Table). **[**** ** ** ** **2\\. Better housing price indicators** Second, action is needed to develop** property price indicators**. The economic crisis in several advanced countries, primarily in Europe and the United States, served as a reminder that excess demand and credit can lead to highly overvalued house prices in boom times, exposing households and banks to the risk that a price reversal could significantly affect their wealth and capital levels. **The recent expansion in mortgage loans and the potential for house price increases in some countries in Latin America is therefore a factor that needs to be analyzed more closely and carefully. **The absence of systematic housing price series for the majority of countries in the region hampers risk monitoring and assessment and, by extension, timely decision-making to avoid excesses related to the real estate sector. Currently, and in contrast to emerging countries in which data availability is somewhat higher, only four countries in Latin America produce data on [housing prices (see chart).[ Further, many of the series are of short duration, with varying coverage and sometimes varying methodology used (see, for example, the European Commission's price index [manual). Still, the methodological and operational challenges to preparing comprehensive and unified housing price measurements should not be a deterrent to pushing ahead with work in this area. **3\\. More details on the financial structure of companies** There is a need for more detailed **information on the financing structure of the corporate sector**, particularly regarding foreign currency and maturity mismatches, and exposures to complex financial instruments such as derivative contracts. Companies tend to increase their debt levels when external financial conditions are favorable'as is currently the case for many emerging markets'which, in many instances, can exacerbate mismatches on their balance sheets. For example, currency mismatches (in cases of firms with foreign- currency-denominated debt and local-currency-generated income) and maturity mismatches (in cases of firms with predominantly short-term debt). This was one of the key vulnerabilities during the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. Countries in Latin America have made welcome progress on the compiling and disseminating balance sheet data, especially for the largest companies. However, relatively little information is available on their debt structure (currency and maturity) and financial exposure, including to derivative instruments. Shortcomings of this nature were brought to light in Brazil and [Mexico in 2008, when severe losses occurred from operations in the foreign exchange derivative market. Systematic compilation of such data is a difficult, but nonetheless, vital task in properly assessing risk, particularly given the complex interactions between the corporate and financial sectors. The measures adopted in Brazil and Mexico starting in 2009, for instance, could be used as a good starting point. In [Brazil, all financial institutions are currently required to report their exposures to derivative contracts (see the Central Bank of Brazil's _[Financial Stability Report_). Similarly, in [Mexico, all companies that issue securities, capital, or long-term debt are now required to document the market, credit, and liquidity risks related to financial derivative contracts and to assess their importance for the company's financial position (see the Bank of Mexico's _[Financial System Report_ and the amendments to the [Stock Exchange Law).

The three Baltic states'Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania'were among the first victims of the global financial crisis. ** After a spectacular boom, with several years of Chinese-style growth rates, these small and open economies faced an equally spectacular bust. Credit'and with it property prices, consumption, and investment'collapsed. Exports were hit by the global depression. And the financial sector came under severe stress. Indeed, Latvia was forced to nationalize its largest domestic bank and had to ask for a bailout from the European Union and the IMF. The conventional wisdom at the time was that these three countries would have to give up their long-standing currency pegs against the euro and devalue. After all, this is what countries facing a trade and financial shock most often choose to do. But the Baltic governments begged to differ. They opted to maintain their currency pegs and instead let their economies adjust through 'internal devaluation'\u009d: a mix of budget and wage cuts, supported by financial and structural reforms. **Meltdown avoided** It is too early to pass final judgment on the success of the Baltic strategy. Adjustment is still far from complete, and the current problems in the eurozone may yet complicate recovery. What is clear, however, is that the most dire predictions have not come true. Despite an unprecedented economic downturn'cumulatively, GDP has shrunk by about a quarter'devaluation and banking crises have been avoided. Impressed by the authorities' determination and mindful of the regional implications of a potential devaluation, [we at the IMF supported Latvia with a ['\u00ac1.7 billion loan as part of an international rescue package of '\u00ac7.5 billion. The financing provided to Latvia also boosted confidence that Lithuania and Estonia would weather the storm. In a recent [paper, my colleague Catriona Purfield and I take a closer look at how the authorities' policies played out as the crisis evolved in 2008-09. We also highlight differences between the three countries, which are often overlooked by outside observers. Even though the initial adjustment was rapid, the crisis has left a severe legacy. Unemployment remains high, public finances still pose a challenge, competitiveness needs a further boost, and the banking system is still being repaired. That said, all three countries have recently started growing again, helped by a pick-up in external demand. **How it worked** How were the Baltics able to achieve such large-scale adjustment under a currency peg? '\u00a2 First, their economic structures, having undergone fundamental changes in the past two decades, proved** relatively flexible**. There is early evidence that companies and workers are adapting quickly to the post-boom environment. '\u00a2 Second, small foreign currency markets, dominated by a few domestic players, made it **virtually impossible **for outsiders to take speculative positions against the three currencies. '\u00a2 Third, **close integration **with Nordic neighbors, especially foreign bank ownership, added to stability as deep-pocketed parents (backstopped by their home country governments) were willing and able to absorb losses rather than pulling out. '\u00a2 Finally, fiscal belt-tightening, including necessary, but painful measures to reduce wages, pensions, and social benefits, were **broadly supported **by the population. Such determination is rooted in strong social cohesion and a shared desire to maintain stability and eventually adopt the euro, a symbol of the three countries' membership of the European Union and their ties to the West. **Different starting points, different outcomes** Differences between the three countries also hold lessons. The crisis was deepest in **Latvia**, probably because imbalances during the boom were the largest there. The banking system, which is partly domestically-owned, proved particularly vulnerable to a sudden stop and capital outflows. **Estonia**, in contrast, contained pressures on its public finances and financial system better than its neighbors and has just succeeded in adopting the euro, becoming the 17th member of the euro area on January 1, 2011. This remarkable achievement was due to three factors: '\u00a2 **Timing**'the recession started earlier in Estonia and the government moved quickly to adjust policies. '\u00a2 **Institutions**'sizeable fiscal reserves were built up during the boom and Estonia has a tradition of strong tax compliance. '\u00a2 A fully foreign-owned banking system'Estonia's banks received **strong capital and liquidity support from abroad**, further boosted by a precautionary swap line between Swedish and Estonian central banks. Estonia's experience shows that prudent policies during the boom may not avoid a bust, but they can put the country into a better position to deal with shocks. The size of imbalances also matters. In **Lithuania**, a delayed (and smaller) boom may now make it easier to regain competitiveness. The Baltic experience demonstrates that large economic adjustment, including nominal wage and benefit cuts, is indeed possible under a currency peg (or, for that matter, in a currency union). What it takes, however, is both grit and flexibility.

If they are deemed to be successful, it will not be an exaggeration to claim that **a new model for global economic and financial governance will be under way**. If unsuccessful, however, the sense of failure likely would undermine confidence while adding to the formidable list of challenges to be overcome. **2010'a year of accomplishments** In fact, **last year was one of substantial accomplishments**. Global economic growth staged a clear-cut recovery. Indeed, last year's estimated 5 percent annual global growth was above the 3.6 percent average rate of the previous decade'although the expansion remains uneven and incomplete. **Financial sector reform efforts began to bear fruit**. Significant reforms were agreed for the international financial institutions (IFIs), including the [International Monetary Fund. **The Leaders' process at the [Group of Twenty (G-20) leading advanced and emerging market economies began to assume a sustained and sustainable form. **At the same time, however, none of the [five key challenges that I had described a year ago'securing the recovery; protecting the poor from the impact of the crisis; reforming the financial sector; restructuring and reforming the IFIs; reassessing the theoretical underpinnings of prevailing economic and financial policies'has been met fully. **Moreover, new challenges have emerged that will require urgent attention. ** **Last January, the global outlook justified tempered optimism. The same is true today**. Nonetheless, success in meeting the key challenges will require significant'and mutually consistent'policy efforts on the part of major economies. Notably, the IMF has been assigned a substantive role in meeting all of the key challenges. Just as is the case for the major economies and their policymakers, however, the Fund will need to implement important innovations in order to meet the new demands. However, the very real prospect of achieving the basic goals of strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth provides an ample incentive for making the required efforts. So where do things stand as 2011 begins? **Global outlook** Overall, the 2011 economic outlook is promising. However, as my colleague Olivier Blanchard pointed out in a recent [interview, **the pattern of rapid emerging economy growth, combined with only trend-like growth in the advanced economies, despite their significant margins of excess capacity, is likely to prevail this year, as it did in 2010. ** Although domestic demand growth has quickened in most emerging economies, their aggregate trade surpluses remain substantial. At the same time, high unemployment, weakened household balance sheets, sluggish income gains and a still-healing financial sector are holding back advanced economy recoveries. In fact, as of 2010's third quarter, only Canada among the G-7 economies had matched its pre-crisis output peak. As a result'assuming that current policies are maintained'**no important progress is expected reducing the large current account imbalances that still undermine confidence in the expansion's sustainability.** The outlook also remains clouded by several downside risks. I'll mention three. * **Renewed turbulence** in sovereign debt markets could spill over to the real economy and across regions. Investor sentiment in Europe is particularly precarious. * Failure to reduce **high unemployment**'coupled with downside risks for housing markets in several advanced economies'**could undermine consumer confidence**, slowing consumer spending and weakening the global growth outlook. * The emergence of above-trend growth, rising asset prices, and accelerating inflation in several emerging economies is sparking **worries about potential overheating**, as well as about difficulties in coping with growing capital inflows and strengthening currencies. In other words, despite the overall global growth rebound, **substantial shifts will be needed in order to secure the intended goals of strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.** Moreover, the critical role for enhanced global economic and financial policy cooperation is self-evident. The recent sharpening of the IMF's role in this area also will place an increased premium on the Fund's ability to meet its new and expanded responsibilities**** **Consolidating cooperation** The G-20 Leaders' process has been developed since late 2008 in response to the recognized need for more effective global cooperation on economic and financial policies. Each of the [five Leaders' Summits has produced an agreement to broaden and deepen the mechanism for such cooperation. The recent Seoul Summit was no exception. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, concerted policy action helped to limit the economic downturn and to set the stage for recovery. At that time, of course, policy prescriptions generally were similar across all economies. **The current state of the recovery makes the process of cooperation more complex, but also correspondingly more important.**** **In this second, post-crisis phase, the demands of policy coherence have become more subtle. The perceived need to act with alacrity and simultaneity is less acute than before. Moreover, with emerged and advanced economies performing differently, coherence demands differing policy prescriptions The increased incentives for policy cooperation'together with the need to adjust policy programs to fit the disparate circumstances of the G-20 economies'has been anticipated in the decisions made by Leaders at their recent Seoul Summit. The [Mutual Assessment Process (or G-20 'MAP'\u009d) has been ratified as an ongoing initiative, to be guided by an agreed set of 'indicative guidelines,'\u009d with progress toward the underlying goals of strong sustainable and balanced global growth to be assessed at an individual economy level and reviewed by the Leaders at their next Summit. The [Seoul Leaders' Declaration contained an extensive'but widely overlooked'list of each G-20 economy's proposed policy adjustments as part of the MAP. Of course, the challenges of this novel process are substantial. **There is no exact precedent for the ambition of the G-20 MAP**. As is made clear in the IMF's MAP analytical documents published following the Toronto and [Seoul Summits, the underlying motivation for the MAP is the shared recognition'heightened by the crisis'that a coherent and cooperative approach to economic and financial policymaking holds out the promise of a superior outcome for all. In this case, the incentive to strive for a cooperative approach is straightforward. **This insight justifies optimism regarding the potential for the MAP's success**. The principal uncertainty is whether such an approach will be adhered to by the entire G-20. The MAP is a G-20-led exercise, but the Leaders have requested significant Fund support for the MAP process. For example, the G-20 Leaders asked the IMF to 'provide an assessment as part of the MAP on the progress toward external sustainability and the consistency of fiscal, monetary, financial sector, structural, exchange rate and other policies.'\u009d More broadly, the latest challenges and IMF reforms have both enhanced the Fund's role and responsibilities and increased the importance of the Fund producing analysis of the highest technical quality. **Surveillance renaissance** Therefore, 2011 will be a year in which advancements in IMF economic surveillance come to the fore. The Fund's [Triennial Surveillance Review will take place this year, providing an opportunity for IMF members to assess the progress that has been made in this area, as well as to set priorities for the coming triennial period. In this regard, the Fund has begun to better integrate assessments of financial stability into regular country reviews. In particular, [Financial Sector Assessment Programs'conducted jointly by the IMF and the World Bank'henceforth will be [mandatory for all Fund members with systemically important financial sectors. Fund support for the G-20 MAP will constitute a challenging but potentially uniquely productive assignment, and it will help to deepen the surveillance dialogue with Fund members. Already, the IMF is developing on an experimental basis several new tools for multilateral analysis, including spillover reports on the wider impact of systemic economies' policies, and cross-country reports on common themes. The first such ['spillover' assessment is to take place during the coming year. **In particular, the IMF will produce reports for five systemic economies'China, the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States**. These reports will assess the impact of the five economies' policies on the rest of the world, exploring the powerful economic and financial interlinkages through which they are transmitted. At the same time, the Fund's crisis prevention tools have just been strengthened, through reforms of the existing [Flexible Credit Line facility, and through the creation of the [Precautionary Credit Line. Additional work is underway to explore whether further advances can be made in the Fund's crisis prevention capabilities. At the same time, the IMF's important work on financial sector reform will continue unabated, among other things through collaboration with the [Financial Stability Board. I will end by repeating my opening claim: 2011 will be a pivotal year for the global economic recovery, for international policy cooperation, and for the Fund's role in dealing with both of these challenges. **The grounds for cautious optimism are solid. At the same time, the challenges are formidable. The New Year has arrived; it's time to get to work**.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's Managing Director, did not exaggerate when he asserted that the agreements of 2010 were 'the most important reform in the governance of the institution since its creation.'\u009d What will happen now, and why is it so important? **Three major changes have been agreed to**. Each one is a major reform and the culmination of years of work. Each one will be difficult to make effective. Each one should prove to be a blessing, but only if it is well implemented. First, **the fast-growing emerging market countries will have a bigger say in how the institution is run and how it interacts with its membership**. For the first time, the combined voting power of the United States and the current European Union members will fall below 50 percent. Although largely symbolic, this transition has the **potential to change the culture of the institution**. Because the reform also looks forward so that future changes in countries' growth rates can be incorporated every few years, it overcomes at least some of the inertia that has tethered the IMF to the past. Asia and Latin America will gain in influence in the short term, and Africa can be accommodated as its economic performance continues to improve. Advanced European countries will have fewer seats on the Executive Board but will have the opportunity to consolidate their positions and become more effective as a group. These changes will be difficult to complete because they require sensitive political commitments by several countries. Whether they will improve the policies and decisions of the Fund depends on how the emerging markets'countries that are still developing their roles in the international economy'choose to use their new influence and how receptive the traditional powers prove to be. Second, **the institution has become much more flexible in the way it lends money**. When the IMF made its first loans in 1947, it had just one technique: an immediate currency swap (the borrower's domestic currency exchanged for a convertible currency, usually U.S. dollars). It gradually expanded the repertory to include stand-by arrangements, extended (larger and longer term) arrangements, more favorable terms for loans to cover commodity price shocks or loans to low-income countries, and other special-use facilities. At the end of the 1990s, the Fund had at least ten lending facilities, but all of those that were in active use required the borrower to undertake a detailed program of macroeconomic and structural reforms. Recently, however, after many years of failed attempts, the IMF has succeeded in setting up lending facilities that are more suitable for countries with good track records and solid commitments to implement good policies on their own. **The goals of this reform are to improve the Fund's ability to avert financial crises and to respond more flexibly to borrowers' needs**. The new facilities may also help reduce the stigma that has long been associated with asking the IMF for support. The main challenge will be to ensure that borrowers do carry out strong policies, put their financing difficulties behind them, and repay the loans when they fall due. Past efforts by the Fund to be more flexible failed in part because weak loan conditions often were followed by weak national economic policies, and in part because the conditions were still considered to be stigmatic. Finding the right balance between discipline and flexibility is bound to be an ongoing test. Third, **the general financial resources of the IMF, which usually have been quite scarce in relation to member countries' financing needs, are to be doubled**. That increase, however, is to be matched by a rollback in the Fund's standing borrowing arrangements. The main immediate effect of this reform, therefore, will not be to increase the amount that the IMF can lend, but rather to reduce the need for the Fund to borrow from creditor countries to finance large lending operations. The challenge in coming years will be to ensure that the IMF's resources are adequate, are used well, and do not become a substitute for the difficult policy reforms that can be made only when manifestly necessary. **The reforms of 2010 will not be the end of the road.** One major ongoing effort is for any future competition for the leadership of the IMF to become more open. All of the Fund's ten Managing Directors have been European. All eight of the Deputy Managing Directors (First Deputies since 1994) have been from the United States. For the past decade, while non-European candidates for Managing Director have been nominated but ultimately rejected, pressure has been intense for the selection process to be open fully to all candidates without regard to geography. The IMF's Executive Board, which selects the Managing Director, agreed in principle several years ago to open up the process, but winning higher political support for the reform has not been easy. If I had a crystal ball, however, I believe that it would show that important progressions such as this will take place; **that the IMF of the next decade will continue to evolve to reflect the rapid and major transformations in the world economy**.

In the past couple of years, Hong Kong has witnessed a sharp increase in property prices. This has led some to claim that the time has come to change Hong Kong's 'Linked Exchange Rate System'\u009d. **This represents a misdiagnosis of the current situation and the wrong prescription for Hong Kong.** It is true that the average cost of an apartment in Hong Kong has risen by almost 20 percent in the past year alone. This stands in stark contrast to what our latest World Economic Outlook described as the [dismal outlook for real estate markets in the industrial countries. And, [like many countries in the region, Hong Kong has been the destination for an extraordinary amount of global capital over the past two years. But how much of these trends have been a product of the exchange rate regime? ** A few facts are worth considering.** First, no other fixed exchange rate arrangement has seen anywhere near the scale of inflows that Hong Kong has experienced. Second, rising property prices are not unique to Hong Kong. House prices have been going up in a range of Asian economies, all of them with very different exchange rate regimes. ['Listen to Ashvin Ahuja talk about 'China: Property Bubble in the Making?' **While the currency regime has been part of the story, I believe that the motivation for the large inflows lies also in the strength and resilience of the local economy**'Hong Kong is both a vibrant market for new equity issuance and a safe haven for international capital. The inflows, in many ways, are a symptom of Hong Kong's economic success. In the property market, low interest rates, imported courtesy of the link between the Hong Kong and U.S. currencies, have no doubt played a role. Mortgages are cheaper which has encouraged many to borrow to invest in real estate. Indeed, mortgage lending has expanded by almost 15 percent over the past year. But other factors are also at work. There is a strong demand for property from both Mainland Chinese investors and from high net worth professionals that are moving to work in Hong Kong's rapidly expanding financial services industry. At the same time, current supply conditions are unusually tight and, while construction is underway, it will take time before those new units actually hit the market. So what to do? [Our view is quite straightforward. Higher housing costs will not be solved by changing the Linked Exchange Rate System. Hong Kong's exchange rate regime has, time and again and for more than 27 years, shown itself to be a robust anchor of monetary and financial stability. Instead, property price inflation should be tackled through measures that are carefully targeted at the property market itself. * **First, apply stricter lending standards that help guarantee the integrity of the financial system in the event of a downturn. **Regulatory tools should be deployed to ensure that banks carefully manage their credit risks and home buyers do not over-extend themselves in the housing market. This means higher downpayments for home purchases and more conservative limits on the share of a borrower's income that can be used to service their mortgage. * **Second, increase transactions costs to dissuade short-term players who are in the business of buying and selling housing in the hopes of making a quick profit.** Higher stamp duties, penalties for cancelling primary market transactions, and an increase in property taxes will all dampen such short-term speculation. * **Third, increase the amount of land available for residential development. **Efforts are well underway on this front and the new government steering committee on housing land supply has committed to making available enough land to build 20,000 new private residential units annually over the next decade. '\u00aaIn all of this, it is essential to stay well ahead of the curve. We have seen all too many times the economic and social damage that can be wreaked by a property price bubble that is allowed to inflate and then burst. **A rising risk of a housing bubble in Hong Kong should not be ignored.** Instead, it should be met with a countervailing policy response that is proportional to the risks. The government's recent announcements'to further lower loan-to-value ratios and raise stamp duties'represent a proactive and well calibrated response to the current risks. Going forward, it will be essential to remain vigilant and introduce further measures, should circumstances so warrant. **Failure to do so would raise the risk that today's property market exuberance results in a future downturn that could prove both protracted and painful.** ", "index": 663}, {"pub": "12/15/2010", "title": "Today\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Bounty, Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Promise: Better Policies to Manage Natural Resources", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2242", "content": " By [Leslie Lipschitz (Version in [Espa\u00c3?ol | [\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfFran\u00c3\u00a7ais | [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9? ) ** Countries rich in natural resources are often looked at with envy: they face few financial constraints and that _should_ speed their development path. But the reality is less rosy.** Countries with an abundance of natural resources'typically oil, gas or minerals'have, on average, performed less well than comparable non-resource rich countries. **That raises one of the perennial questions in economic policymaking. How to manage the economic and social challenges that stem from resource wealth?** Or, to borrow the words of Professor Thorvaldur Gylfason (University of Iceland), how to prevent 'nature's bounty'\u009d from 'becoming the curse of the common people'\u009d? **Broadening the policy dialogue** While this issue isn't a new one, it is **particularly topical for a number of African economies that have new natural resource discoveries about to come on stream**. So, in early November, the IMF Institute, in cooperation with the Bank of Algeria, organized a [High Level Seminar on Natural Resources in Algiers, focusing on the challenges that these countries face, and distilling lessons from countries that have managed their natural resources successfully. The seminar brought together senior officials with experts from academia and civil society organizations. One of the advantages of being an international organization with a near- global membership is that the IMF is a unique repository of examples of member countries' good and bad policy practices and experiences from which other policymakers can learn and benefit. The IMF is thus well placed to **bring together policymakers and experts to discuss what has worked and what has not'that is, to learn from one another and from history. Participants from Botswana, Chile, Mexico, and Norway discussed what had worked best in their countries, and some other country representatives were quite frank on what had not worked in their experience.** **Common themes** The benefits from 'picking each other's brains'\u009d were immediately evident in Algiers. Representatives from countries with newly discovered natural resource wealth, such as Ghana and Uganda, had the opportunity to ask direct questions and get advice from experts and from other policymakers about how best to manage resource wealth. Several themes emerged. **Many acknowledged the difficulties of negotiating contracts with big multinational extraction firms about the sharing of exploration costs and the distribution of profits.** * Clearly governments want to ensure that a fair share of the profits stay in the country, while companies want to be certain that the initial investment in exploration and discovery will yield a fair return. * While countries shared their experiences, they also heard the point of view of a major global petroleum company. Various technical experts also weighed in with suggestions on how contracts could be structured to deal with various contingencies. **A second universal question is how the benefits should be shared between current and future generations.** * This entails a careful balancing act between the urgent need to address current poverty and the longer-term investment strategy'and it often requires substantial political fortitude and robust institutions to ensure that domestic spending does not exceed the level that can be absorbed effectively. * While there is clearly no single ideal, universally applicable solution, elements from many of the countries' strategies might well be useful in other cases. **The primary common denominator of success was undoubtedly good governance underpinned by robust and transparent institutions.** **Underlying these natural resource-specific issues is the need for a stable and predictable macroeconomic environment to enable countries to capitalize on their resource wealth.** Here, the views of the IMF were sought on a range of macroeconomic issues'such as designing fiscal policies, monetary and exchange rate policies for cushioning the volatility of resource revenues, and the efficacy of 'industrial policies' designed to favor specific sectors (for example, through trade policies or budgetary subsidies). **Continuing the dialogue on good policies** **While the High-Level Seminar in Algiers provided a rich and varied discussion, it would be naive to think that there might be a 'quick fix' for an issue that countries have struggled with for many years. ** But, to the extent that this seminar'the proceedings of which we plan to publish as a book'has stimulated policymakers' thinking about both the complexities and successful examples of managing natural resource endowments, it will have met our objectives. **What is needed is an ongoing consultative dialogue inclusive of the civil society and a collaborative approach. ** We at the IMF are committed to being part of that conversation. In addition to country level policy discussions, we will continue to engage on two broad fronts: * First, by providing technical assistance in areas such as tax and expenditure policies, monetary policies under alternative exchange rate regimes, and the use and management of sovereign wealth funds. * Second, by providing training opportunities. For example, following the Algiers Seminar, the IMF Institute launched a new two-week course on 'Macroeconomic Management in Resource Rich Countries'\u009d (at Stellenbosch University in South Africa). This course aimed at giving a broad overview of _all _topics and challenges involved in policymaking and strategic planning for countries with resource wealth. Next year the course will be offered again'to different regional audiences at the Joint Vienna Institute in Austria and the Joint Partnership for Africa in Tunisia.

The balanced budget fiscal rule has supported fiscal discipline and a reduction in public debt. Moreover the structure of this debt has been radically improved'Mexico has created a deep domestic bond market and extended maturities. The introduction of inflation targeting has cemented the credibility of Banxico and fostered a reduction in inflation'that most unequal of taxes on the poorest'to low single digit levels. Meanwhile, the deep commitment to the flexible exchange regime has created an important safety valve for the economy. **Better outcomes** These investments paid dividends during the crisis. Yes the impact on Mexico of the deep shock in the U.S. was profound, with GDP falling by over 6 percent in 2009. But the country's strong institutions provided a key anchor and most importantly, space for the authorities to take action to soften the blow of the downturn on the population. Both fiscal and monetary policies were eased to support the economy. The exchange rate and other prices adjusted to maintain economic equilibrium. Recognizing the strength of the policy framework, the IMF invited Mexico to pioneer the new [Flexible Credit Line which is designed to provide insurance against external shocks to countries with very strong economic policies, like Mexico. This successfully contributed to warding off tail risks during the crisis. And Mexico is now recovering well, with growth expected at 5 percent in 2010. **Global shift taking place** [The financial crisis has marked what may be seen by future generations as a moment of profound transformation in the world economy. So-called emerging market countries are coming to the fore, both as sources of global growth going forward, but also by taking on an increasing role in global governance, including through representation at the IMF. Latin America is a key part of this change, with fast growing economies such as Brazil, Chile and Peru providing important support to the global recovery, but also benefiting from increasing trade links with fast-growing Asian countries. This transformation creates challenges, such as managing the pace of growth and the flow of capital to emerging markets. But it also creates opportunities to achieve a sustained rise in living standards in these countries. **Challenge for Mexico** Mexico needs to grasp this opportunity by ensuring continued stability, but above all, taking steps to make the economy more dynamic. [The important fiscal reforms put in place by the authorities will maintain an orderly fiscal situation over the next several years while preserving fiscal space for priority spending. Indeed, Mexico needs public investment in infrastructure and successful social safety net programs such as _opportunidades_. But looking further ahead, with oil revenues as a share of income forecast to decline and pressures from population ageing likely to rise, more fiscal resources will need to be found. This will require looking again at the tax system, including the structure of the VAT and income taxes, but also at the nature of spending, including on subsidies, particularly in the electricity sector. [Most importantly, Mexico needs to prioritize boosting its very low long-term growth rate and create the jobs of the future for the youth. This will require tackling some difficult issues, particularly the ones I discuss below: * **_Competition_.** Economic dynamism is held back by a lack of competition in key sectors of the economy. Increased competition will lower costs and increase productivity, boosting growth. Recent efforts to reform the competition framework are an encouraging step forward. But experience around the world has shown that implementation'in the face of opposition from vested interests'is key. * **_Public services_.** Mexico needs a government that can provide the services of the future, whether it is lower cost energy or better infrastructure. This will require further reforms in the public sector and to the budgetary framework. Also key here are steps to support human capital formation, including by raising education achievements. * **_Labor markets_.** The large size of the informal economy is a symptom of the rigidities in Mexico's formal labor market. Increasing the flexibility of the system, while considering appropriate and affordable social protections as needed, is key to create more and higher productivity jobs. We hope to discuss these issues and challenges with leaders and young people while in Mexico with Mr. Strauss-Kahn. We want to understand better what Mexicans are thinking and planning in order to assure their rightful place in the future global economy.

More than a dozen countries in the Middle East and Central Asia region, and countless more outside the region, shared this experience. But while there are clearer signs of recovery in some countries, credit to the private sector is still barely growing in the GCC, notwithstanding policy efforts to revive it. It might seem easy to ring the alarm bells. After all, won't the prospect of weak credit growth restrain economic activity in the short-term? Perhaps. **But we believe the negative impact of credit growth may not be quite so severe. ** Why not? In part, that answer lies in how we arrived at the current situation. **Causes of the credit slowdown** **[In the five years before the crisis, the GCC countries'Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E.'experienced significant increases in credit**, spurred by favorable macroeconomic conditions. At its peak, credit growth exceeded 30 percent year-on-year. The crisis reversed the situation. Credit growth quickly fell and has remained anemic so far during 2010. **[** **Factors affecting both the supply of, and demand for, credit played a role in this slowdown.** * On the supply side, while funding strains have been overcome, higher risk aversion and stricter lending policies by banks have stifled credit growth. The decline in credit growth may also reflect banks in all GCC countries reconsidering their lending practices, which had sometimes relied more on the reputation of the borrower (so called 'name lending'), rather than credit analysis. * In most countries in the GCC, demand for credit appears to have dropped in association with the decline in real estate prices, the slowdown in construction activities and non-oil growth, and the corresponding weakness in investor and consumer confidence. **Silver lining in the credit slowdown** There are a number of reasons why we are not as concerned about the slowdown in credit growth. 1\\. **The adjustment in credit growth reflects a much needed correction** from very high'perhaps unsustainable'rates of credit growth witnessed during the boom years. 2\\. **There are already some signs of a rebound in credit growth**'albeit modest'in Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia. 3\\. **Banking system health is generally satisfactory. **Capital adequacy ratios'in loose terms a bank's ability to absorb losses'remain strong. And stress tests conducted by IMF staff indicate that banks are generally resilient to severe shocks. Moreover, there was significant progress in financial and corporate restructuring during 2010, helping to shore up market confidence. The underlying conditions are therefore in place to support a resumption of credit growth, although this might be gradual. 4\\. **The overall numbers for banking sector credit growth mask important underlying trends**. We are seeing a positive trend of credit growth away from volatile sectors (like real estate and household equity purchases) toward more stable sectors such as industry, trade, and services. Credit growth to these sectors has been healthy in a number of countries. 5\\. **Bank credit growth numbers don't tell the whole story. **The private sector is getting some credit through alternative channels of financing: * * Some governments are guaranteeing foreign debt issued by government-related entities (Qatar and Abu Dhabi). * Some governments are increasing their advance payments to contractors (Qatar and Saudi Arabia), thus lowering the need to seek bank credit to cover their working capital. * Specialized credit institutions, especially in Saudi Arabia, have significantly increased their credit to domestic sectors. 6\\. In general, **corporates in the GCC appear to have adequate cash balances** and can finance their operations from these cushions in the short term. **So, is policy action still needed?** While fiscal and monetary policies have been geared to support the GCC to emerge from the impact of the global crisis, this isn't an open-ended option. Ultimately, the private sector will have to play a more active role and, for that, reviving private sector credit growth will be instrumental. **Just as supply and demand factors were at work in the credit slowdown, so should policies aim to address those factors**: * On the demand side, we believe it is appropriate for country authorities to maintain fiscal stimulus'if there is fiscal space'and quantitative easing in 2010, and possibly into 2011. These policies would need to be revisited at signs of a pickup in inflation, which remains relatively muted. * To improve credit supply: Corporate governance and financial disclosure and transparency will be key. And banks will need to build up their capacity to assess credit risk. Additionally, there is a need to develop alternative domestic sources of corporate funding, primarily domestic or regional debt markets. This will not only help with diversifying the economy's financing channels, but also improve standards for financial disclosure.

And we know that **investment in infrastructure can raise productivity, boost growth, and help reduce poverty. **But as straightforward as it sounds, getting investment decisions right is no easy feat. **For starters, low-income countries have massive investment **needs. The World Bank has estimated that, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, the total financing need is around $93 billion _per year_. And one third of this still unfunded. **Even when financing is available, there's a raft of other issues to tackle. **What investments offer the biggest boost to growth? How much investment is needed and by whom? How to finance this investment without taking on too much debt? **New sources of growth and investment** **Many low-income countries showed a lot of resilience during the global economic crisis. **A global recovery is now underway, but it remains fragile and uneven. In particular, the more fragile outlook for many advanced economies means they're less likely to be a big source of growth or financing for the foreseeable future. **The key issue now is for low-income countries to unlock new sources of growth and investment financing.** At the same time, the more robust recoveries of dynamic emerging market economies and their new status as development partners brings fresh perspectives. After all, scaling up investment was a large part of their successful shift to a higher growth path. Against this backdrop, the IMF recently sponsored a one-day [conference on the issue of scaling up infrastructure investment in low-income countries, which was a chance to bring these different perspectives together. Several overarching messages emerged. **1\\. Stronger framework for public sector investment decisions** There are several broad principles that can guide better investment decisions * First, countries need to develop a coherent strategy for scaling up infrastructure that maximizes the growth potential. * Second, countries need to follow through on their investment strategies. For this, they need a strong institutional framework that keeps implementation in line with the strategy, ensures that projects are properly appraised and good projects selected, and sees that adequate resources are budgeted so that investment projects can be completed and maintained. Good governance and strong public financial management systems are critical. * Third, countries need to be savvy about how they finance the scaling up. * They need to make sure that the fiscal revenue base is strong and growing'through tax reform and good revenue administration'so that the public sector can more easily afford the debts it takes on. * They need to ensure that all borrowing indeed finances investment, and hence growth, not consumption. * They also need a good debt management strategy to ensure that the overall amount and type of debt that the country assumes is within its capacity to repay. **2\\. Support for capacity building** **Multilateral institutions and donors can help with financing, of course, but their contribution to capacity building is equally important.** From the IMF's perspective, this includes helping countries to design budgets consistent with infrastructure plans, to build capacity to manage their debt, and to develop better tools to assess the likely growth returns from investment. **But, new development partners have their own, fresh perspective on how to fill infrastructure gaps, so they have knowledge to pass on.** The Chinese, for instance, have had a lot of success in planning coherent investment, constantly reassessing infrastructure gaps and reorienting resources. They also ensure that their infrastructure projects are linked up'for example, if they build a port, they also build roads and railways that lead to the port. Low-income countries can benefit from this kind of experience. **3\\. A bigger role for the private sector** **While the government needs to define the strategy and identify gaps, there are areas where it is sensible to rely mostly on private sector investment. **The energy sector and telecoms are two examples of where a mixture of public and private sector investment can work. **Tapping private sector equity financing also allows investment to be scaled up beyond what the government might be able to afford.** So it is crucial that governments create the all important enabling environment'good tax system, good governance, and a sound legal framework'and give confidence that the environment will allow a proper return on private investments. While it's difficult to do justice to the richness of discussions at the conference, we hope it can set the stage for ongoing dialogue about how low- income countries can increase the volume and quality of investment in a sustainable way.

This is part of a broader effort to be more transparent and accountable to the broader public in our member countries. **So, an emphasis on change at the 2010 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings provided the perfect opportunity to break new ground in our relationship with civil society. ** More civil society representatives came to the meetings than ever before, and those that came participated in a wider range of events. Many of those events took on a different flavor: one more conducive to a meaningful exchange of views. **So who came?** **Representatives from around 400 civil society organizations (CSOs) from over 62 countries attended the Annual Meetings.** They came from all regions, representing big umbrella groups from Europe and the US, as well as smaller local level entities. The CSOs also had diverse interests. Some were focused on Fund-specific policies in low-income countries, while many others advocated for specific issues, including youth, gender, labor and governance. **As part of the Fund and Bank's approach to make the annual meetings more accessible, fellowships were offered to around [40 civil society representatives** from more than 30 emerging and low-income countries. **Listening and learning** With so many influential voices here, we were intent on hearing what they had to say. **By working together and hearing the views of a wider range of stakeholders, the IMF can be better placed to tackle the breadth and enormity of the challenges in today's global economy**. As one of the civil society fellows, Joseph Ibekwe of Nigeria, said'the IMF can 'work with civil society to make a difference.'\u009d **We wanted to facilitate a more productive dialogue. Not just during the Annual Meetings, but for the future too.** We wanted to provide events that would facilitate a better understanding of each others' roles and interests, and that would continue to raise the quality of our discussions and help us work together in our member countries. As we had done before, the central event was a [Civil Society Policy Forum, involved 50 sessions organized by CSOs reflecting the diversity of their interests. But, it is important to highlight some of the things we did differently. * We opened the doors for civil society to take part in a wider range of formal and informal meetings, including this year's expanded [Program of Seminars, as well as meetings with the IMF's country teams (helping civil society to put a face to the name). And, for the first time, many CSOs were invited to attend the opening plenary session of the Annual Meetings, traditionally an officials-only forum. * This year, the [Townhall meeting with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn and World Bank President Robert Zoellick had a more interactive format. Gone were the long formal opening speeches. Instead, the discussion was chaired by civil society representatives and focused on more time for conversation about core IMF and World Bank issues. * But, perhaps the real ground-breaker was a new capacity building event targeted at CSOs. Senior staff briefed CSOs on key aspects of the Fund's policies and programs, including fiscal, monetary, and program design issues. Arranged at the request of CSOs, it was an opportunity for those here to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of macroeconomic policy, and what the IMF does. **Two-way street** One thing was very clear. Civil society is thirsty for information. They want to know more about what we do, why we do it, and how. In that regard, part of our aim was to improve discussion and access to information, so we can focus more on matters of mutual interest. But this is also a two-way street. There is a lot at the IMF we can learn from CSOs, from their experiences and their views on issues and conditions 'on the ground'. And we have to start by listening. * Civil society representatives offered valuable insights and raised tricky issues. [We heard from them on a range of issues, many of which are also at the forefront of our mind'unemployment and poverty reduction in the wake of the global economic crisis; financial sector taxation; IMF voice and representation; and on the need to engage with CSOs in reforming the IMF, in our work in program countries, and at the local level. * We also need to build the tools internally to raise awareness or build a deeper appreciation of the role that civil society can play, especially in the local context, in our member countries. This is something on which we'll be focusing on early next year. Our relationship with civil society has evolved dramatically over the past decade. These changes during the Annual Meetings were another step and, as we continue, we hope to hear from you.

Where did they go wrong, and what implications does the crisis have for both macroeconomic theory and macroeconomic policy making?** This was the topic of this year's [IMF Jacques Polak Research Conference. The conference was the first since the passing of [Jacques Polak, after whom the conference has been named, and to which he came every year until last year. Present at the Fund's creation and a long time Fund economist, Jacques had been described by the Managing Director as 'a leader of critical thought during the post-war evolution of the global economy.'\u009d As such, this conference, and its focus on the post-crisis evolution of the global economy, was fitting a fitting tribute to Jacques. We shall miss him. **Post-crisis policymaking** The twelve papers presented at the conference provided rich fodder for discussion. For two days, researchers and policymakers explored the contours of policy making in the post-crisis world. I want to share with you some of the major themes: **1\\. The crisis has forced us to pay much more attention to fiscal policy.** The rising public debt in advanced economies poses questions on the appropriate scope and timing of fiscal action, be it further stimulus or consolidation. [One paper presented a framework for assessing the scope for fiscal maneuver ([fiscal space), by comparing current debt levels with what might be the sustainable level of debt based on each country's track record with fiscal adjustment. [Another paper investigated the optimal timing of fiscal consolidation when monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound. A commitment to future consolidation can generate an immediate stimulus by lowering the long-run risk premium. The difficulty, as policy makers understand well, is obviously how to make such commitments about the future credible today. **2\\. Monetary policy can lessen the adverse effects of financial disruptions on the real economy.** [One paper showed, using a quantitative macroeconomic model, how the negative feedback between the financial sector and real economy resulted in such a deep economic contraction with the 2007-09 crisis. Policy simulations using the model show the macroeconomic benefit of a monetary policy rule that allows the policy rate to respond to changes in financial conditions. [Another paper gave evidence that lax monetary policy leads to a decline in risk aversion in financial markets. If present, this effect should be taken into account in designing monetary policy. Whether this should be done through adjustments of the policy rate, or through macro prudential measures, is clearly a central issue of monetary policy today. **3\\. International capital flows can weaken financial stability**. [One paper modeled so called 'hot money episodes.'\u009d When one country experiences a crisis, global investors need to find other destinations for their investments, leading to inflows of hot money into other countries. While the next destination can benefit for some time, all too often these capital inflows are followed by another crisis. [Another paper showed that international financial integration'when not accompanied by fiscal integration among countries'can result in an undersupply of safe assets (high-grade sovereign bonds) and spread the financial fragility. The relevance of these papers to capital flows, either to safe havens or to emerging market countries, that we are observing today is an obvious one. **4\\. Given the critical role of the financial sector in the crisis, regulatory issues and the interplay with the real economy took center stage.** * [One theoretical paper examined how the behavior of firms can be less efficient because government bailouts are highly likely in a deep crisis. Regulatory design should take this into account, thereby reducing the distortions due to expected bailouts and facilitating better outcomes. [Another paper emphasized the need to strike the right balance between too lax or restrictive regulation. Very light-handed regulation, together with expectations of bailouts, can lead to very risky behaviors and an excessive expansion of the financial sector, while an 'overregulating' to prevent crises will stifle economic growth. The link to the problems faced by a number of advanced countries today is, again, an obvious one. * Macro prudential regulation was also the theme of two major sessions of the conference. For the keynote address of the conference'the [Mundell-Fleming lecture'Anil Kashyap (University of Chicago) focused on fire sales'asset sales at an excessive discount'as a source of financial and economic instability, drawing some implications for the design of macro prudential regulation. The same theme was debated among four expert panelists who joined the [Economic Forum, the concluding session of the conference. The conference was an important opportunity to contribute to the post-crisis policy debate. But, it also made clear how much we still have to learn, from the interaction between monetary policy and financial markets, to the meaning of fiscal sustainability, and to the design of macro prudential regulation, to name just a few.

Equally astonishing, and unexpected, was the central role that U.S. money market mutual funds played in contributing to this wholesale shut-down. ** In our chapter on systemic liquidity risk in the October 2010 _[Global Financial Stability Report_, we describe this aspect of the financial crisis and propose some concrete recommendations on how to fix it. **Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008, financial institutions suddenly found it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to borrow short-term cash, even against assets that had relatively low risks.** Some of the key investors into this short-term funding market'money market mutual funds'started leaving the market. Suddenly, these funds wanted higher margins on repurchase transactions and they wanted their asset-backed commercial paper to be backed by more secure collateral (i.e., cash reserves or other assets). **The source of these difficulties** This was because money market mutual funds were being squeezed as investors tried to withdraw funds _en masse_ following Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy_._ These withdrawals or redemptions were triggered in turn by the failure of the Reserve Primary Fund to maintain its 'net asset value'\u009d (NAV) at par, or above the US$1 per share price. (Share prices falling below US$1 'known as 'breaking the buck'\u009d'can trigger massive redemptions (a run) as money market mutual funds are forced to sell their underlying assets at increasingly lower prices and realize losses.)_ _These disruptions also affected many non-U.S. banks that relied heavily on the U.S. wholesale market to fund their dollar-denominated assets. **Almost overnight, it became painfully clear that no one really understood the central and systemic role of money market mutual funds in the financial system**; not the market participants, nor the regulators. The U.S. government was forced to respond, taking extraordinary steps to stabilize the money market mutual fund industry. **Since then, a number of reforms have been put in place. These focus primarily on minimizing the risk of another run by investors. **Money market mutual funds in the Unites States now face new rules designed to increase their ability to withstand redemption pressures. More specifically, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission modified Rule '2a-7 Funds'\u009d that governs mutual funds to impose constraints on asset quality, new liquidity rules, and restrictions on collateral acceptable for their repo operations. **While we believe that these measures will indeed lower the risk profile of the industry in the short term, they do not mitigate sufficiently the system-wide risks posed by this sector.** As a general principal, we believe that financial institutions that contribute to systemic liquidity risk, and that offer typical banking services, should be set up and regulated as banks_. _ **Options for addressing industry risk** One option would be for money market mutual funds to retain their bank-like business activity, but be re-licensed as banks. This would clearly require a substantial change in their structure, capitalization, and regulation. **An even better option, in our view, would be for these funds to move, over time, to a floating NAV.** This would be a less fundamental change, and have several clear advantages. * First, it would make it clear to everyone that market risks are borne by the investor, in contrast to a bank deposit where there is a guaranteed return of principal, underpinned by public deposit insurance. __ * Second, this would remove any special treatment favoring money market mutual funds in the United States relative to commercial banks, thereby address concerns about a 'level playing field.'\u009d __ * Third, it would help eliminate the 'first-mover advantage'\u009d'a key factor behind destabilizing runs'whereby early redemption requests are paid at par, even if actual asset values are lower, leaving investors that do _not_ rush for the exit bearing disproportionate losses.__ **The key idea is to provide a clear signal to investors that placements in money market mutual funds are different than deposits in banks.** Armed with more accurate information about the risks, this should help ensure that money is not allocated to these funds under false pretenses. It would also reduce a systemic component of bank funding'posed by these funds'the next time a system-wide funding problem emerges.

The poor state of fiscal accounts of most advanced countries calls for austere fiscal policies, before the confidence crisis that is now hitting a few small advanced economies spreads to the larger ones. But not right now: a frontloaded adjustment'that is a tightening that is not gradual but falls disproportionately early in the adjustment phase'could destabilize the recovery. **But can countries limit frontloading and still achieve credibility? Yes, but baking the right fiscal pie is likely to require a number of ingredients.** While the exact recipe depends on country circumstances, here are our suggested ingredients. **1\\. Fiscal rules** **For starters, countries can adopt rules to constrain their future behavior, with strong legislative backing and appropriately tough penalties in case of misbehavior.** The truth however is that rules will help, but they are unlikely to be enough. For one thing, a fiscal rule that is appropriate for the long run'say, a structural balanced budget rule'cannot be immediately enforced when the starting point is, in many cases, a deficit close to double digits. A convergence period will be needed'as in the case of the Germany's new fiscal rules, which targets a balanced structural balance only by 2016. And, to make that convergence credible, other ingredients are needed. **2\\. Multi-year spending limits** **Second, reasonable multi-year spending ceilings, endorsed not just by the government but also by parliament, will be crucial. **In countries where spending ratios are high, a large part of the adjustment will have to come from spending restraint. This has been a feature of successful fiscal exits, such as in Sweden and Canada in the 1990s. It is missing in a number of countries, including the largest world economy. ******Here the difficulty is to reconcile the need for hard ceilings, which can not be easily revised, with a modicum of flexibility in case the recovery falters.** * This means that some items should be exempt from the ceilings, particularly expenditures that are cyclical like unemployment benefits, non-discretionary like interest payments, or fiscally neutral like EU-funded projects. * It also requires ensuring that the legislative process for revising the ceilings (often annual and likely to be unavoidable at least for some spending items) does not turn into a free-for-all fiscal party. **3\\. Open and accountable budgeting** **This takes us to the third ingredient, fiscal transparency. Countries need to be transparent in formulating budgets and presenting them to the public. **Markets and the public must be confident that medium-term plans, or changes to them, are justified by overriding macroeconomic considerations, and not, for example, by short-term political goals. They should also be confident that revenue projections'and the underlying growth assumptions'are not the result of wishful thinking. **The best way to achieve this is to establish a politically-independent fiscal agent to monitor fiscal policy making.** The United States has one, the Congressional Budget Office. Many European countries do not, although some, like Germany and the United Kingdom, have recently introduced them, following positive experiences in Nordic countries. For these newcomers, the test will be to show genuine independence. For the others (the two advanced countries with the largest debt-to-GDP ratios'Japan and Italy'do not have them yet) early action in this direction is urgently needed. **Transparency also means providing the public with comprehensive information on the state of public finances. Surely advanced countries already do this, right? Not so. ** * Of the nine advanced countries in the G-20, how many produce fiscal statistics covering the whole public sector'including the central bank, state mortgage guarantee institutions, and other publicly-owned corporations? Only three. * How many of them publish alternative fiscal scenarios; that is, information not only about the fiscal baseline, but also on what happens if shocks (say, higher interest rates), materialize? Only five. * How many publish adequate statements of tax expenditures (the revenue loss related to special tax treatment of certain sectors and activities)? Only four. (And what is the point of spending ceilings if they can be circumvented by granting tax deductions?) * How many countries do all of the above? Only Canada. **4\\. Disciplined budget preparation and execution** **Next, countries need more disciplined budget preparation and execution processes**. Budget preparation should be driven by the overall medium-term deficit and spending ceilings. That is, it must be 'top down.'\u009d Budget execution should be underpinned by processes that minimize the risk of slippages. Here advanced countries fare relatively well. And yet, some further progress is needed, including in some European economies. **** **The recipe. Just mix-and-bake?** Finally, we come to the most difficult part: countries need some frontloaded measures to give some filling to the pie. Hang on! Did we not say that front- loading is wrong (except when failure to do so would make things even worse)? **Here we need to distinguish between approval of the measures and their implementation.** Frontloaded implementation would not be appropriate in most cases. But frontloading legislative decisions on measures that will take effect at a later date, or that will affect the economy gradually over time is definitely appropriate. For example, a partial or total freeze of turnover of retiring public employees falls in that category. Simple, isn't it? Of course not, as otherwise it would have already been done. But it is easier than dealing with the consequences of living without a credible medium-term fiscal plan. **A post-scriptum: **All of the above is just to whet your appetite. What is just as interesting is to see how the medium-term fiscal adjustment plans announced over the last few months by major economies stack up against the above recipe. If you want to know more about this we suggest you savor our newly released _[Fiscal Monitor_.

Both the outlook for Africa, and reactions to it, have been very positive. **The groups we met with were encouraged by our central message'Africa's resilience to the global economic crisis has owed much to good policy management here, both before and during the crisis.** They also welcomed our optimism about the prospects for growth in the region, tempered of course with concern about the continued risks to the global recovery. But policy-makers and others have also taken to heart our view that now is the time to start rebuilding some of the savings that were used to weather the crisis. While I'm still here in Dakar, Senegal for the final leg of our trip, I wanted to share some of our thoughts on the 'growth challenge' in West Africa. First, the good news. As in most of the continent, the countries in West Africa fared relatively well during the global financial crisis. The slowdown was mild and growth rates appear to have already bounced back to their pre- crisis levels. However, there has been an intriguing longer-term difference between West Africa and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa_._ **West Africa hasn't been able to move into, and sustain, the higher rates of economic growth needed to make serious inroads in job creation and poverty reduction.** **The growth challenge** **We delve into the issue of what matters for long-term growth in the **[**_Regional Economic Outlook_****.** We compared the experience of the eight countries of the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)'Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo'with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These eight countries, which form a single trading block and have had a single, stable currency over the last fifteen years, have benefited from low inflation. But they have not done so well on growth. **While experience has varied between these countries, over the past fifteen years per capita incomes grew, on average, by less than 1 percent each year.** In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the growth rate has been more than twice that; and more than four times that in the region's highest growers. **The reasons for WAEMU's slower growth are complex. No single factor or simple story emerges**. But it was certainly not just because of initial income levels, natural resource endowments, or the location of WAEMU countries. Nor were global forces, namely world trade or prices, primarily to blame . **What's holding back growth?** **So, if external developments were not the main problem, there is room for the region to improve its own performance.** Let me focus on the four factors that we found to be particularly noteworthy in impeding lasting growth. * Periods of political instability were associated with particularly lackluster performance in the slower growing WAEMU countries'C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Togo. This reflected, in part, political instability and the difficulties for macroeconomic management * Private investment rates in most WAEMU countries have been noticeably lower than in other sub-Saharan African countries'in both the public and private sectors'with relatively little foreign direct investment. * The region has had less success than sub-Saharan Africa's best performers in establishing the right conditions for economic activity. For example, perceptions of governance remain weak. WAEMU countries have ranked low in the World Bank's _Doing Business_ Survey and other composite indicators. * Inadequate physical infrastructure and weak public services, especially in education and health, also played a role. Underinvestment in physical and human capital undermines the private sector's ability to produce goods and services efficiently. **Actions to raise growth** **So, we believe that there is plenty that can be done to shift countries into a faster trajectory.** **First and foremost, political stability is a necessary precondition for macroeconomic stability and sustaining improved performance.** Countries in WAEMU also need to upgrade weak energy and transport infrastructure, and improve health and education standards. A more competitive, or efficient, private sector will require the assurance of good governance, including market-friendly regulations, effective financial sector supervision, and enforcement of laws. **Countries in the region will also need to make room for higher pro-growth government expenditure.** This will require increasing revenues so critical investments can be made, building the capacity to safely attract and manage private finance, and improving the quality of spending. An important first step in this direction, already taken by some countries in the region, is to improve budget institutions, focusing particularly on improving financial management, prioritizing expenditures, and ensuring their high quality. Encouragingly, the four higher-growing WAEMU countries'Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal'performed significantly better in the last fifteen years than they did in the fifteen years before that.

Of all the things policymakers have had to worry about in the past couple of years, inflation wasn't one of them. Some even heralded the end of inflation. **Today, inflation still isn't a 'problem' in Asia. For the most part, it remains relatively modest, but it is on the rise in some countries in the region. And understanding what is driving that inflation matters.** Policymakers need to consider the sources of inflation in making the right policy choices. What policy tools to choose. And, at this juncture, how to manage the withdrawal of policy stimulus left over from the crisis, and strike the delicate balance between low inflation and economic growth. The issue of what drives inflation'or so-called inflation dynamics'is one of the issues we examined in our October 2010 [_Regional Economic Outlook_ for the Asia and Pacific region. In this post, I wanted to share with you a few of our findings. **Inflation pressures are building up** **Although inflation has generally remained within what central banks consider to be a comfortable zone, the conditions are ripe for rising core inflationary pressures**'that is, inflation excluding volatile items such as food and energy. For a start, economic activity in much of emerging Asia has been growing faster than we had expected so far in 2010. And the differences between what these countries are actually producing and what they could produce operating at full capacity'what economists like to call 'output gaps''have been closing rapidly. Yet financial conditions remain still quite accommodative (e.g., low interest rates, plenty of liquidity). So what is the outlook for inflation in the region? If growth continues to be robust, is there a risk that inflationary pressures in Asia could accelerate? Or is inflation in the region still largely a reflection of global food and energy prices'a big share of how consumers in the region spend their money? **Changing inflation patterns** **Inflation patterns differ across the region.** For example: * In China, inflation mainly responds to food prices, as the economy's large capacity to supply other goods and services keeps non-food inflation down. * In India, by contrast, although commodity prices are a key factor, both the domestic supply of and demand for goods and services have a significant impact on inflation. But, looking at Asia more broadly, our analysis points to three factors that policymakers should consider as they monitor inflationary pressures. **First, the combination of economic growth rates above a country's 'potential' or full capacity, and easy monetary conditions (such as negative real policy rates) is usually a recipe for inflationary pressures down the road.** I realize this might seem like a rather obvious conclusion, and it is. But it is still worth reminding ourselves of it as 'output gaps' across the region are closing rapidly (that is, actual output is getting close to its 'potential' or maximum capacity based on an economy's current structure or characteristics). **Second, although supply shocks (such as commodity prices) continue to matter for inflation in Asia, demand factors are also becoming increasingly important.** As Asian economies grow and consume more, the role of output gaps in driving inflation rates in the region is increasing. This conclusion, too, might strike one as obvious. But I have heard it sometimes said that Asian inflation mainly reflects supply shocks. While this might have been true in the past, I am not so sure that it is still the case today. **Third, when an economy is close to its 'potential', renewed pressures on global commodity prices may be more likely to add to inflation.** At these times, firms find it easier to pass onto consumers increases in production costs. Moreover, if emerging Asia continues to grow rapidly, this may also lead to higher commodity prices, as demand from the region has become an important driver of many of these prices. **The policy implications for the region are evident. ** **If domestic demand pressures continue to become a bigger factor in core inflation, it will become increasingly important to step up the pace of policy normalization.** In fact, this process has already started in many Asian economies, with central banks having raised their policy rates and reserve requirements since late 2009. However, as I said before, **the surge in capital inflows we have witnessed in recent months can be a complicating factor.** For example, by depressing local long-term interest rates, this can undermine efforts to tighten the monetary stance through policy rate increases. Still, monetary tightening has an important role to play in managing the influx of liquidity associated with those inflows, particularly given prospects for monetary easing in advanced economies and the generally limited flexibility of exchange rates here. **In my view, continuing with recent steps to allow for stronger currencies would be more conducive to normalizing the policy stance and would also be more effective in managing volatile capital inflows.** However, structural factors'such as better growth prospects and stronger policy fundamentals than in advanced economies'mean that capital inflows into emerging Asia are likely to remain strong over the medium-term. **This will require policies to better absorb such flows, including deepening of financial markets, and channeling such flows towards financing broader-based growth and much needed infrastructure.** ", "index": 674}, {"pub": "10/31/2010", "title": "More than 18 Million Jobs Needed!", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=2018", "content": " By [Masood Ahmed (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9? ) **For the six oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa region'Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia'high unemployment is a chronic problem. Unemployment rates here are among the highest worldwide.** This can have enormous economic _and_ social costs, with the potential for what the IMF Managing Director has described as a ['lost generation' of unemployed. Figures for these six countries in the region, outlined in our October 2010 _[Regional Economic Outlook_, are staggering. * For the past two decades, average unemployment has been in the vicinity of 12 percent and was still in double digits in 2008. * Even the faster growth that these countries achieved between 2000 and 2008 made only a limited dent in the unemployment problem. * Also alarming is the concentration of unemployment among the youth and the educated. At over 20 percent, youth unemployment is among the highest in the world. In some of these countries it is even higher. In the past, high unemployment in the region led to large numbers of workers moving abroad in search of work. Some estimates suggest that as much as 15 percent of the combined labor force of these countries is working in countries abroad. **But, the region can no longer afford the status quo.** Today, there is increasing competitive pressure from other emerging markets. And sharply higher unemployment in advanced economies means fewer employment prospects, so moving abroad is no longer the 'solution' it once was. **The challenge ahead is daunting.** Over the past decade, the labor force in these six countries has grown on average by 2\u00c2\u00be percent a year, faster than in any other region of the world, save Africa. While labor force growth is expected to slow somewhat over the next decade, it is likely to continue to outpace most other regions in the world. **As a result, these countries need to create about 18\u00c2? million full-time jobs over the next decade** to provide employment for young people looking for their first job and to bring down unemployment. **Why is unemployment chronically high?** First, job seekers do not have the skills that are required by firms wanting to be successful in domestic and international markets. There have been substantial improvements in access to education. Still, firms regularly complain about the lack of suitable skills among job seekers, suggesting that schools and universities fail to produce graduates with the skills needed. Second, hiring practices by the public sector have created expectations for job seekers that private firms often cannot live up to. Governments in the region look for applicants that have university degrees, but often place little emphasis on the type of degree. And public sector wages are relatively high. For example, the Egyptian public sector on average pays 48 percent more than private firms. **What needs to be done?** **_Promote growth_.** While growth is not the sole answer to the unemployment problem, it still helps. But there are difficult challenges for growth too. * The region's traditional trading partners in Europe are growing more slowly, and competition from today's fast growing emerging markets is increasing. * Streamlining the often cumbersome regulations and otherwise improving the business environment would go a long way to raising growth. * Moreover, these countries need to better integrate into global supply chains. They should also see other emerging markets as partners (rather than just competitors), with whom cooperation is beneficial. **_Help job seekers acquire the right skills_.** Here, the challenge is to better align education with the skills needed in today's marketplace. Involving firms or, possibly, chambers of commerce, in the development of teaching curricula would help. Moreover, well-designed training programs for the unemployed would make them attractive to firms looking to hire. A number of innovative, public-private partnerships along these lines are already under way. * In Jordan, for example, 'Injaz''a partnership between the Ministry of Education and the private sector launched in 1999 (which has now expanded to cover a dozen countries in the region)'provides children with teamwork skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and work-readiness training. * Similarly, Cairo University's Career and Entrepreneurship Development Office empowers students to innovate, start their own businesses, and acquire the skills demanded by the market through a range of practical training and internship programs. * And, across the region, the Education for Employment Foundation works with corporations and industries to assess demand for skills and to provide correspondingly tailored training programs for young people. **_Untangle social protection from labor regulations_.** No doubt, governments must help their citizens when they are hit by misfortune. However, this needs to be done in a way that does not create other problems. Firms need to be able to let go workers if their businesses are going through a severe downturn. Instead of too stringent labor market regulations, a tight and targeted social safety net'that includes an unemployment insurance system'is a better way of protecting those in need. The challenge is to strike the right balance.

Of course, 'competitiveness' is one of those nebulous terms that economists love to use. And, as Robert Z. Lawrence'Professor of Trade and Investment at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government'has [suggested: _'Competitiveness,' particularly with reference to an entire economy, is hard to define. Indeed, competitiveness, like love or democracy, actually has several meanings._ For us, competitiveness means mainly that a country can successfully export its goods to other countries and that domestic industries can hold their own when it comes to imports. **What are the ingredients for being competitive: high productivity, business environments that help firms rather than put obstacles in their ways, and workers that are skilled and experienced.** **Policy actions to raising competitiveness** **So, if these countries are to achieve higher growth rates, they must rapidly enhance their competitiveness.** First, I should acknowledge that they have made substantial progress toward this. But, international rankings'the World Economic Forum's _Global Competitiveness Report_ is one example'point to specific areas in need of further improvements. On the trade front, over the past two decades, most of these countries have reduced the number and level of tariffs levied on imports. Egypt and Syria, in particular, have accelerated progress in this area in recent years. Such moves, in many countries, have been accompanied by the privatization of formerly government-run key industries. Together with easier access to foreign capital and technology, this has boosted export growth and helped improve economic outcomes of the past decade. **Nevertheless, tariffs in these countries remain high (still averaging double digits), and these and other impediments to trade still need to be tackled.** **Much also remains to be done to make labor markets more efficient.** * In many countries, a dominant public sector attracts many of the most qualified graduates and also serves as a 'safety net' for those who cannot find jobs elsewhere, and often at wages well above those for comparable private sector jobs. Government pay scales should differentiate across skills within a framework of overall wage and hiring restraint. * And education systems need to focus more on ensuring that new workers have the skills and knowledge that the private sector needs. **These reforms should go hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce'or even eliminate'regulatory 'red tape' and strengthen institutions**, thereby providing a more job-friendly environment for the private sector. But helping an economy become more competitive means going beyond remedying these types of 'internal' inefficiencies. It requires countries in the region to set up sophisticated transport, communications, and financial services that will allow them to integrate into the global supply chain and, thereby, tap into new export markets. And, here, there are some excellent examples within the region of what works. * Tunisia, for one, stands out as having become an 'outsourcing hub.' It has successfully attracted foreign direct investment in textile production, car assembly, and food processing over the past several years and, more recently, in information technology and aeronautics. Simplified regulation, modern infrastructure, government incentives, and commitment to a knowledge-based economy that generates well-trained, low-cost workers, are key factors in this success. * Dubai'notwithstanding the fallout from its reliance on large-scale, highly-leveraged property development'has transformed itself into a dominant regional hub for international trade and services by setting up a cutting-edge logistics industry, with remarkable success in multiplying the emirate's GDP. * Other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have also made great strides in improving competitiveness by enhancing institutions and upgrading their infrastructure. The challenge now is to build on this to further upgrade their innovative capacity and education outcomes to help diversity their economies away from the hydrocarbon sector. **For the countries in the region, greater competitiveness will be the crucial ingredient in the recipe for continued, and even greater, economic success.** ", "index": 676}, {"pub": "10/28/2010", "title": "Addressing External Vulnerabilities in the Oil-Importing Countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1999", "content": " By [David Owen (Version in [\u00d0 \u00d1?\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9) **Countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia region'especially those that import, rather than export, oil'were hit hard by the Great Recession of 2008/09. **The good news is that, today, the outlook for those countries is broadly positive. But, as often seems to be the case in today's world, this good news is tempered with a word of caution. **According to our latest [_Regional Economic Outlook_ for the Middle East and Central Asia, there are a number of downside risks.** And the key challenge for these four countries'Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan'will be to take actions _now_ to address these risks. **Emerging vulnerabilities** **Governments and central banks reacted appropriately to the daunting challenges of the last two years**; with fiscal stimulus (financed partly by more donor support), monetary easing and, in some cases, exchange rate depreciation. The policies are paying off: growth has picked up again across most of the region. **But this policy response has also had costs: external debt has ratcheted up again, while current account deficits are chronically high.** * External debt has risen to levels that are high for emerging and developing economies. We anticipate external debt will reach 65 percent of GDP by the end of 2011 in Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic, and, although somewhat lower in Tajikistan and Armenia, it is on an upward trajectory. * Armenia and Georgia both have double-digit current account deficits. And, in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, current account deficits are less worrisome, but likely to rise in 2011. Such large current account deficits imply high external financing needs and these may not always be easy to meet, leaving these countries more exposed to the whims of global economic developments. **With limited access to international financial markets, the four countries have relied'to different degrees'on foreign direct investment and donor support to meet their external financing needs.** But foreign investment is in short supply today and unlikely to return to its pre-crisis levels. And donor support is declining from its crisis peak toward the levels observed prior to 2008. While this does not pose an immediate problem, over the longer term, external current account deficits will need to adjust to more affordable levels. **Much to do on many fronts** But exactly what actions are needed to reduce these emerging vulnerabilities? The answer lies in two broad objectives. **The first is to rebuild domestic savings, as high external debt and deficits are principally the result of insufficient domestic saving. **As such, the key to reducing them lies in containing government spending. * Armenia and Georgia'where the problem is most acute'have already embarked on this process. * Beyond next year, policymakers in Tajikistan will have to make tough choices in balancing the need for capital and social spending against limited domestic and external financing. * The new Kyrgyz government faces difficult fiscal decisions once it takes over from the transitional government. **And, as with the broader call for economic rebalancing by 'deficit' countries, steps are needed to ensure that over time the private sector can also play a bigger role. **In particular, export industries in some countries need to become more competitive; for example, through continuing to work on improving the business environment so as to attract more investment. **Second, greater exchange rate flexibility can also contribute to the required adjustment. But a careful, indeed gradual, approach is needed given constraints imposed by the banking sector.** * A large proportion of the loans extended by domestic financial institutions are denominated in foreign currencies. So a large and sudden exchange rate depreciation would leave many borrowers (whose income is mostly in domestic currency) unable to repay their debt. This, in turn, could result in banks needing to write-off nonperforming loans, for which they may eventually require a fresh injection of capital. * Therefore any move toward greater exchange rate flexibility should be accompanied by prudential regulations that will guide banks to take only appropriate exposure to foreign-currency risk. In this regard, Armenia and Georgia have both taken steps to enhance the provisioning against future losses, and capital requirements for, foreign-currency loans. The region has seen a number of external crises since independence from the Soviet Union. Time and again, high current account deficits and rising external debt precede such crises. Governments and central banks reacted appropriately to the daunting challenges of the last two years. **_Now_ is the time to unwind those policies and ensure that policymakers will again have the necessary policy space to manage possible future external shocks.** ", "index": 677}, {"pub": "10/25/2010", "title": "Investing in a Rebalancing of Growth in Asia", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1973", "content": " By [Anoop Singh Continuing my travels through Asia for the launch of our October 2010 _[Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific,_ I am writing to you today from Singapore. In my [last post, I focused on the near-term outlook and challenges for Asia. Today, I turn to the key medium- term challenge'the need to rebalance economies in the region away from heavy reliance on exports by strengthening domestic sources of growth. This is against a backdrop of the need to rebalance _global_ growth that was emphasized over the weekend by the ministers of the Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market countries. Heavy reliance, arguably over-reliance, on exports is a common challenge across Asia. Yet, the policies to address it will differ among the countries in the region. Much of the public discussion focuses on ways to increase consumption, and this is something the IMF has written about extensively in the past. But the role of investment in rebalancing growth is equally important and something that should not be overlooked. **Current gaps in investment** Across the region, investment could play a bigger role in driving growth in three respects. * Overall investment appears low in some parts, but not all, of Asia. This tends to be more of an issue for the leading economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). * Elsewhere in the region, such as the newly industrialized economies (Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China) and Japan, aggregate investment is in line with comparable countries outside the region. But, the composition of investment is skewed toward exporters and capital-intensive firms, which crowds out domestically-oriented and labor-intensive enterprises. * In addition, rapid growth across the region has stretched existing infrastructure close to the point where it severely constrains activity. **Boosting investment** What are the main reasons for this situation, and what can be done about it? Two important factors seem to be at play. * First, investment in many regional economies has been subdued over the past decade or so. This reflects lower returns, greater uncertainty and mixed perceptions about the ease of doing business particularly since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. However, financial constraints also played a role. In particular, small and medium enterprises, as well as firms operating in the services sector, appear to have limited access to financing, including in Japan and Korea. In these cases, modernizing the ways banks extend credit (including more risk-based financing) or make it easier to restructure the finances of small and medium enterprises, can help reduce the impediments to investing in the services sector. * The second important factor concerns shortfalls in infrastructure, which also suppress private investment spending. This is most pronounced in the ASEAN region and low-income economies. With most infrastructure in the region provided by governments, greater private participation through public-private partnerships may help address critical bottlenecks while also reducing pressures on public coffers. **Policy actions under way** The good news is that several countries are already taking steps in the right direction. * Japan and Korea are improving the financial infrastructure for smaller and more service-oriented firms through reforms in collateral laws and creating a market for distressed corporate assets. * Indonesia and Malaysia have taken steps to improve the business environment by easing restrictions on foreign investment in the services sector and creating 'one-stop shops' for investors to reduce administrative delays. * And many countries, including low-income ones, are making greater use of public-private partnerships to promote critical investment in infrastructure. Clearly, it will take time _and_ steadfast implementation of reforms to boost investment and, in turn, rebalance Asia's growth. But the strength with which shock waves from the financial crisis hit markets across Asia'from India to Japan'also remind us that Asia's economies will be the primary beneficiaries of strengthening their domestic engines of growth. The time has come to invest in a rebalancing of growth in Asia.

Thus, each of the countries that have adopted a new structure for the macro- prudential approach following the global crisis ' including the United States, the euro area, and the United Kingdom ' have created somewhat different forms of organization. In contrast, traditional micro-prudential regulations ' that focus on the status of individual financial institutions and on the conditions prevailing in markets for specific financial instruments ' long have been formed through cooperation in international standard-setting bodies. It is not surprising, therefore, that post-crisis reforms in traditional regulation already have made substantial progress, with improved international accords in many sectors being agreed in time for the upcoming summit for the leaders of the Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market economies (G-20) in Seoul. **Macro-prudential conference in Shanghai** [**Recognizing the need to reach greater understanding about the potential roads to internationally-consistent and effective macro- prudential regulation'and in an effort to make sure that an appropriately broad range of views are taken into account'earlier this week, the Peoples' Bank of China hosted an IMF-sponsored conference in Shanghai**. The conference brought together central bankers and senior financial officials from Asia and around the world to examine and discuss key issues regarding macro-prudential policies. The conference, titled _Macro-Prudential Policies: Asian Perspectives_, allowed international participants as well as Fund staff attendees to benefit from the views of key Asian policymakers. And vice versa. **What are the aims?** **At the conference, there was wide agreement that the first step in designing macro-prudential policies ought to be a convergence of views regarding the objectives of such policies.** Of course, the most basic objective is straightforward'to prevent a crisis like the one just experienced. As the recent crisis unfolded, troubles in one institution spread quickly to related institutions as well as across national borders, rapidly and dramatically undermining the complex global web of financial relationships. The crisis thereby demonstrated that examining only the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions was inadequate. Supervisors need to be aware of, and respond to, the build-up in system-wide risks. Thus, a key challenge is to put in place a regulatory framework that ensures the safety and soundness of the entire financial system, and captures how the economic and financial systems affect each other. **A basic objective of reform is to design and implement policies that will short-circuit _cross-institution or cross-market knock-on effects_ that magnify problems. A second objective is to reduce the likelihood that the system as a whole will experience such knock-on effects.** This means seeking to dampen the swings in credit and financial cycles that can produce financial system volatility that can damage both the stability of financial markets and the broader economy. **Means of implementation** **A _basic practical issue_ is how macro-prudential policies can be incorporated with the traditional set of policy tools.** **One option would be some type of capital surcharge or levy based on the degree of systemic risk created by any specific financial institution. **In addition to classic micro-prudential requirements for minimum capital to back individual institutions, the new approach would add a new capital layer that takes into account the systemic importance of an institution. The idea would be to modulate an institution's behavior by making it more costly to pursue those activities that contribute to the build-up of systemic risk. **Other proposals to control systemic risk focus on quantity rather than price-based restrictions, including constraints on size or legal structure or certain activities by financial institutions. **In general, however, price-based instruments tend to be more effective because quantity-based instruments may be more subject to gaming and regulatory arbitrage. Because systemic risks refer not only to institutions but also to markets, new measures should be considered that would make key markets more resilient. **Effective Implementation through Cooperation** **Like so many other policy challenges facing modern, globalized markets, a cooperative solution is required. **Policymakers need to ensure that macro-prudential policies in differing countries'when designed and implemented'do not contradict or offset each other. **Supervisors also need to focus on cross-border exposures. **The effective resolution of large and complex financial institutions that operate in multiple jurisdictions will need to rely on a clearly-designed cross-border framework to reduce moral hazard and support financial stability. On this point, the [IMF has proposed a pragmatic approach. We hope a small set of countries that house the most interconnected firms will begin to make progress in this area. For many countries, an open question remains regarding which agency should design and implement macro-prudential policies ' a new global body, a central bank, or the existing micro-prudential regulatory body? In general, participants in the Shanghai conference favored this job being awarded to central banks. **Whatever path is chosen, however, the regulators must be supported by good information gathering, clear mandates and powers, effective tools, and, perhaps most important, cooperation between authorities nationally, and across borders.** ", "index": 679}, {"pub": "10/21/2010", "title": "Sustaining Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Recovery", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1931", "content": " By [Anoop Singh **I am in Asia this week to launch our October 2010 [_Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific_ (REO) in Jakarta and Singapore. As I have inevitably found during visits to Asia over so many years, the mood here is confident about future economic prospects. **Yet it is also watchful for risks that may be lurking over the horizon. This mood matches closely the main messages of our current assessment of the outlook for the region. **Skillful policy management** **A self-sustaining recovery is now under way across Asia, with policymakers in the region having skillfully and effectively managed their response to the global downturn.** Almost all regional economies grew above trend in the first half of 2010'even those that suffered the most pronounced downturns. Three factors helped the recovery: a rebound in global manufacturing and trade; policy stimulus; and, importantly, a recovery in private domestic demand. The recovery in private domestic demand should help to sustain strong growth in Asia even after the global inventory cycle has run its course. We expect gross domestic product in Asia to grow by about 8 percent in 2010, nearly a full percentage point higher than we expected six months ago. Growth should then moderate to a more sustainable, but still healthy, 7 percent in 2011. **External risk factors** **The external environment appears to be the main risk for Asia.** If the recovery, and hence demand, in advanced economies were to falter, this could once again reverberate through the supply chain in Asia. A financial shock in advanced economies, such as funding shortfalls at a systemic institution or further concerns about sovereign creditworthiness, could spread quickly through financial markets and into the real economy. It would also cause capital flows to be more volatile, which tends to have a negative impact on domestic demand in Asia. **Managing capital inflows** **But, for now, the pressing issue for Asian policymakers is how to manage the tide of large capital inflows.** For example, here in Indonesia, inflows over the past year have been extremely large, especially relative to the size of the local financial markets. And Indonesia is not alone. Capital is flowing to economies all over Asia in large part because of the favorable growth prospects here. And Asia's appeal will remain very strong as long as advanced economies remain sluggish, and their interest rates low and monetary conditions accommodative. How, then, to react to what some have called a 'wall of money'\u009d that could be heading Asia's way? **Managing capital inflows is a difficult challenge. **These inflows present many opportunities, but they can also pose potential risks. To limit the buildup of financial vulnerabilities, several Asian economies have taken macro-prudential measures'that is, measures that ensure not just the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, the entire financial system and its macroeconomic impact. But ultimately, capital inflows will likely prove persistent and our sense is that broader actions will be needed. [[ [[ **Time to normalize policies** **Indeed, the time has come to normalize fiscal and monetary stances, particularly as Asia's recovery is now well established.** Although many central banks have raised policy rates, monetary policy in the region generally remains accommodative. With output gaps closing rapidly, core inflationary pressures have begun to assert themselves. While capital inflows can be a complicating factor, monetary tightening has an important role to play in managing the influx of liquidity associated with those inflows, particularly given prospects for monetary easing in advanced economies and the limited flexibility of exchange rates here. The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus also remains gradual for the most part, and it is appropriate now to accelerate the pace of consolidation. Stronger currencies will be needed as part of the policy tightening. As I have [argued before, currency appreciation is also needed in many economies as part of the policy package for rebalancing growth.

Why was the crisis so severe'and how do we avoid a repeat? We consider just that question in our fall 2010 [_Regional Economic Outlook: Europe_. While the crisis was triggered by external shocks, it is clear that domestic imbalances and policies also played a key role. After Lehman Brothers defaulted in September 2008, global trade collapsed, capital inflows into the region plummeted, credit growth suddenly stopped, and domestic demand plunged. But pre-crisis domestic imbalances and policies made a difference in how these shocks affected each country's economy. Some countries saw declines in gross domestic product (GDP) similar to those in the Great Depression (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine), while others avoided declines altogether (Albania, Poland). **Origins of the crisis** **The seeds of the crisis were sown, in large part, in the five years before the crisis.** Between 2003 and 2008, much of the region experienced a boom in bank credit, asset prices, and domestic demand. This boom was fueled and financed by large capital inflows. With low interest rates in advanced countries, banks in western Europe expanded aggressively into emerging Europe'where returns were higher. And, while the influx of capital boosted growth, it also led to rising imbalances and vulnerabilities. * Current account deficits increased to unprecedented levels in some countries, and inflation accelerated. * Substantial vulnerabilities emerged in bank and household balance sheets, particularly because much of the borrowing was in foreign currency. **The boom years had left much of the region addicted to foreign-financed credit growth, **making it very vulnerable to a disruption in capital inflows. **High-cost experience** **The first lesson of the crisis is one that is unfortunately not new.** Boom-bust credit cycles can be very costly, so it is essential to prevent credit booms from getting out of hand. Indeed, countries that experienced the fastest credit growth during the boom years saw the deepest recessions. And it now appears that average GDP growth over the full business cycle in this group was no higher, and in some cases was lower, than in countries with more modest credit growth. **How to restrain credit booms** **Controlling credit growth is not easy.** Prudential measures alone rarely do the trick, particularly in small countries easily overwhelmed by foreign capital inflows. Fixed exchange rates often impose further constraints. Indeed, it is striking that the strongest credit growth during the boom years took place in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes. This is partly because countries with fixed exchange rates don't have the full range of monetary policy tools to restrain credit booms once they set in. Fixed exchange rates are not the cause of credit booms'there were also some countries with fixed exchange rate regimes that did not have a credit boom. But fixed exchange rates do make it harder to stop credit booms, particularly in the presence of large capital inflows. [[ ** ****Closer cooperation with supervisors** in western Europe can help prudential measures become more effective. Credit booms driven by capital flows from western European parent banks are hard to stop, especially when faced with supervisors only from the (often smaller) recipient country. **Building up fiscal buffers ** **The second major lesson is the need for more prudent fiscal policy.** This is a policy of saving money when revenues are growing instead of increasing spending and boosting public wages. Prior to the crisis, fiscal positions in emerging Europe looked good'better than in other emerging market regions. But those good-looking headline numbers masked a [deterioration of the underlying fiscal position. Public expenditure was surging, financed by a temporary revenue boom. This not only further contributed to overheating; it also set the stage for large fiscal deficits. So when revenue plummeted in 2009 and fiscal deficits increased sharply, many countries had no choice but to cut spending precisely when this was most painful. [ **[** **When revenue takes off during the next boom, it should be used to build up fiscal buffers** rather than boost expenditure. Politically, this may be very challenging'when revenues abound there is strong pressure to increase expenditure or cut taxes'but this will help dampen the boom and create fiscal space that can be used to soften the impact of the next recession. **In search of balanced growth** **Going forward, growth in the region should become more balanced, and less dependent on domestic demand and capital inflows.** Much of the shift will come about through private sector actions. Now that profits in the nontradable sector (finance, real estate, construction) have shrunk, investments will seek more promising venues. More balanced macroeconomic policies and wage restraint can also help maintain balanced growth by preventing the overheating that pulls resources from the tradable to the nontradable sector. **Above all, it will be important'when the next boom comes'to be wary of claims that 'this time will be different.'\u009d** Such narratives often have some plausibility and attractiveness in the heat of the moment. But a careful analysis of the drivers of growth, current account deficits, asset price developments, and credit growth should always be used as a 'reality check.'\u009d ", "index": 681}, {"pub": "10/12/2010", "title": "Weekend in Washington: Cooperating Our Way Out of Crisis", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1874", "content": " By [Dominique Strauss-Kahn (Version in [\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8?\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9?

And uneven. And it is fragile _because_ it is so uneven. In the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, things are going pretty well. Even in Africa, many countries have returned to growth much faster than in previous recessions. In Europe, however, the recovery is sluggish. And in the United States, it remains subdued. The IMF's latest economic outlook, released during the meetings, does not anticipate a \"double dip.\" But there are risks. ### High debt levels The first risk is the very high levels of public debt in the advanced economies'the highest since World War Two. What is needed to restore fiscal balance depends, of course, on the situation facing each country. In the medium term, they all need to restore fiscal sustainability. In the short- term, however'and while the recovery is still fragile'it is a case of consolidate as much as you have to, and stimulate as much as you can. The greatest risk to fiscal sustainability at this point is that growth stalls. A second and related risk is jobs. The world lost 30 million jobs during the crisis; and 450 million more people will enter the labor market over the next decade. So we need growth, but we need growth with jobs. This crisis will not be over until we see unemployment levels begin to go down. The third risk is linked to the financial sector. We all know how this crisis began. We all know that a lot of promises have been made to fix the financial sector so it will not happen again. And while there has been progress in a number of countries and new regulations from the recent Basel III process, it is not enough. We need to ensure that those new rules are implemented. And we need better tools to resolve financial crises when they occur. The financial system is not yet safe enough. On top of all this, there is concern that the strong international cooperation that was shown during the crisis is in danger of receding. After Lehman collapsed, we avoided a second Great Depression because the leaders and nations of the world came together and coordinated their response. We saw this when the leaders of the Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market economies (G-20) met in London and Pittsburgh, for example. The most concrete action was the coordinated fiscal stimulus. And it worked. Now, as we move into post-crisis mode, that spirit of cooperation seems not to be as strong. Perhaps the clearest indication of this were the headlines over the past week about 'currency wars'\u009d and some countries seeking to devalue to gain competitive edge over others. And yet, we know that beggar-thy-neighbor policies do not work. There are no solely domestic solutions to global problems. So, coming out of the weekend'after the meetings'was the atmosphere less tense? Yes'\u00a6and no. ### Common ground On the plus side, the economic leaders represented in the IMF's governing body'the [International Monetary and Financial Committee'found common ground on several important things. * There was a strong commitment to 'the rejection of protectionism in all its forms.'\u009d And an equally strong statement about the importance of 'working collaboratively'\u009d'to ensure growth and to create jobs. * There was a recognition of the need to go further on financial sector reform. And there was a call'which I welcome'for the IMF to contribute to this agenda in collaboration with other international bodies already at work in this crucial area. * Also on the IMF, our membership asked that we focus our economic analysis even more on 'spillover'\u009d issues'that is, the effect that one country's policies might have on others. I believe that by doing this, bringing our unique cross-country experience to bear, we can contribute to helping resolve the tensions we have seen among countries, and to the global rebalancing that is so important for a sustainable recovery. * It was also reiterated over the weekend that the voice and representation of the emerging market and developing countries in the IMF should be enhanced to reflect better their standing in the new global economy. We did not come to final agreement on these 'quota and governance'\u009d reforms over the weekend, but we are not far off. So the bottom line is that the world made some progress over the weekend. But we shouldn't be too self-congratulatory. We are not yet out of the woods. ### Keep pushing As I said earlier, we still have a long way to go to achieve sustainable and balanced growth, to bring back employment, and to make the changes necessary to reduce financial sector risks. Above all, we need to keep pushing, keep fighting, for cooperation. Why? The IMF's analysis indicates that improved economic policy coordination, over the next five years, could increase global growth by 2.5 percent, create or save 30 million jobs, and lift 33 million more out of poverty. With such high potential returns, can we really afford each to go our own way? That question will be high on the agenda for the next G-20 leaders meeting to be held in Korea in November. So all eyes now turn from Washington this weekend to Seoul next month'\u00a6.

Policymakers came together and responded to the crisis with an unprecedented degree of policy coordination.** The crisis also focused the IMF's attention on better equipping ourselves to meet the challenges of today's world. A big part of that transformation is how we engage with our members and the outside world. So, with the [2010 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings, you'll see some big changes. Our goal'for this year and future years'is to provide a forum for people to debate, to learn from each other (and us from them), and to be part of a global conversation. At this critical juncture for the global economy there are many burning policy issues on the agenda. And, we are opening our doors and inviting you'the membership and the broader public'to be part of this discussion. ### Front and center Front and center on this year's agenda is the state of the global economy and the policy priorities going forward. The recovery is proceeding, but it is uneven and fragile. So a key question is how to achieve a [more balanced recovery. And with financial sector weaknesses seen as the [Achilles' heel of the recovery, another key issue is how to strengthen the financial sector. A big part of this is also how to ensure the IMF is equipped for, and representative of, today's global economic realities. So exactly how do we hope to facilitate this exchange of ideas? Under the broader umbrella of our Annual Meetings, and in addition to the meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, our governing body, there will be a host of meetings of different official groups. These include the [Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market economies, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers, the [Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four developing and emerging market economies, and the Group of Seven major industrial countries. There will also be meetings with civil society, academics, and the private sector. There will be numerous meetings and seminars in which these various groups will participate. In all, we expect more than 100 meetings, discussions, seminars, and fora'including the renowned [Per Jacobsson lecture'to take place over the next 3'4 days. ### Inclusive discussion A major part of the dialogue is an expanded [Program of Seminars. The IMF will hold two flagship seminars, followed by three 'breakout' sessions for each of them. Across the street, at the World Bank, there will be a similar program. This is a way to engage participants at the Annual Meetings in discussing the issues that are at the center of the world economic policy debate. But it is also a way to include parts of the membership, and the broader public, in this discussion in a way they did not have an opportunity to do before. The first of our two flagship seminars is the B_BC World Debate_, which will open discussions on the question of 'Stimulate or Consolidate: How to Secure a Robust Recovery?'\u009d With the world still in uncharted economic waters, panelists will discuss the policies needed to achieve equitable, sustainable and job- friendly growth. Among these will be the hotly debated issue of whether (and when) to maintain or withdraw policy stimulus. The three breakout sessions following the _BBC World Debate_ discuss: * the structural reforms needed to secure strong and durable growth, reduce global imbalances on a sustainable basis, and reduce high unemployment; * the challenge of implementing fiscal adjustment strategies, without undermining the recovery, and in a way that supports long-term growth and employment; and * policies to strengthen the financial system, including the appropriate degree of risk, nature of regulation, and need for greater transparency. Together with CNBC, we will host the second flagship seminar on the 'Future of Global Economic Governance'\u009d. As I mentioned earlier, the crisis has highlighted the need for greater policy coordination at both the global and regional levels. It has also prompted a discussion of the need for institutional reforms in countries and regions, and in global institutions such as the IMF. This broader discussion will be followed by three sessions in which panelists will debate: * the future of the global financial and monetary system, and the reforms and policies needed to secure global financial stability and strong, balanced, and durable growth; * how emerging market economies can increasingly become drivers of global growth, and the policy challenges they face in rebalancing global demand; and * the necessary conditions and policies that will help today's low-income countries takeoff and become the emerging markets of tomorrow. As these seminars take place over the next few days, we will be posting comments here with accounts of each of the discussions. But don't just watch this space to see how the debate unfolds. We invite you to add your voice to the discussion by posting a comment.

It requires two fundamental and complex [economic rebalancing acts. First, internal rebalancing. When private demand collapsed, fiscal stimulus helped reduce the fall in output. This helped avoid the worst. But private demand must now become strong enough to take the lead and sustain growth, while fiscal stimulus gives way to fiscal consolidation. The second is external rebalancing. Many advanced countries, most notably the United States, relied excessively on domestic demand before the crisis, and they must now rely more on net exports. Many emerging market countries, most notably China, had relied excessively on net exports, but must now look to domestic demand. ### Too slow These two rebalancing acts are taking place too slowly. Private domestic demand remains weak in advanced countries. This reflects both a correction of pre-crisis excesses and the scars of the crisis. U.S. consumers who had overborrowed before the crisis are now saving more and consuming less; while this is good for the long run, it is a drag on demand in the short run. Housing booms have given way to housing slumps, and housing investment will remain depressed for some time to come. And financial system weaknesses are still constraining credit. External rebalancing remains limited. Net exports are not contributing to growth in advanced countries; the US trade deficit remains large. Many emerging markets continue to run large current account surpluses, and to respond to capital inflows primarily through reserve accumulation rather than exchange rate appreciation. International reserves are higher than they have ever been and continue to increase. The result is a [recovery which is neither strong, nor balanced, and runs the risk of not being sustained. For the last year or so, inventory accumulation and fiscal stimulus were driving the recovery. The first is coming to a natural end. The second is slowly being phased out. Consumption and investment now have to take the lead. But, in most advanced economies, weak consumption and investment, together with little improvement in net exports, are leading to low growth. Unemployment is high, and barely decreasing. By contrast, in many emerging market countries, where excesses were limited and the scars of the crisis are few, consumption, investment, and net exports are all contributing to strong growth, and output is back close to potential. ### Policy implications So, what are the policy implications? What can be done to improve things? First, **wherever private demand is weak, central banks should continue with accommodating monetary policy**. One should be realistic however. Not much more can be done, and one should not expect too much from further quantitative or credit easing. While there is no evidence yet that sustained low interest rates are leading to excessive risk taking, were such risks to materialize, they should be addressed through macro prudential measures, not through increases in policy rates. Second, and wherever needed, **governments must continue both financial repairs and financial reforms**. Many banks do not have enough capital, and tight credit is constraining segments of demand. Securitization, which must play an important role in any financial system in the future, is still moribund. Financial reforms are proceeding, but questions remain about 'too big to fail'\u009d institutions, about the perimeter of regulation, and about cross border issues. The faster reform uncertainty is reduced, the more the financial system will support demand and growth. Third, and again wherever needed, **governments must address fiscal consolidation**. What is essential here is not to so much to phase out fiscal stimulus now, but to offer a credible medium term plan for debt stabilization and, eventually, for debt reduction. Such credible plans may involve fiscal rules, the creation of independent fiscal agencies, and phased-in entitlement reforms. They have not yet been offered in most countries. But they are essential because, when in place, this will give government more fiscal flexibility to sustain growth in the short run. Fourth, **those emerging market countries with large current account surpluses must accelerate rebalancing**. This is not only in the world economy's interest, but also their own. In many of these countries, distortions have led to too low a level of consumption, or too low a level of investment. Removing these distortions and thus allowing consumption and investment to increase is highly desirable. To a large extent, market forces, in the form of large capital inflows, are pushing these countries in the right direction. However, to the extent that some countries do not allow for sufficient exchange rate adjustment, this exacerbates the problem for others. The use of reserves should be limited, and the role of capital controls, if any, should be to direct flows in accord with macroprudential concerns, not to prevent necessary exchange rate shifts. All these pieces are very much interconnected. Unless advanced countries can count on stronger private demand'both domestic and foreign'they will find it difficult to achieve fiscal consolidation. And worries about sovereign risks can easily derail growth. If growth stops in advanced countries, emerging market countries will have a hard time decoupling. These downside risks, which were [described in the GFSR, should not be ignored. The need for careful design at the national level, and coordination at the global level, may be even more important today than they were at the peak of the crisis a year and a half ago.

Progress toward global financial stability has suffered a setback over the past six months'the financial system remains the Achilles' heel of the economic** **recovery. Our outlook envisages a gradual improvement in financial stability as the ongoing economic recovery continues, and as policies that aim to strengthen the financial system are fully implemented. But the outlook is subject to considerable downside risks linked to financial system fragilities and weak sovereign balance sheets. I think the most important thing is that confidence has not yet been fully restored 'although it has improved in recent months, particularly after very decisive policy actions were taken in Europe in May and later on in July. This explains why financial markets remain sensitive to negative surprises and can so quickly shift back to crisis mode. But what is at the heart of this lack of confidence? The first issue concerns lingering financial system fragilities that stemmed from the crisis. Specifically, without further **balance sheet repair and reform**, financial systems remain susceptible to funding disruptions that could endanger the economic recovery and weaken government budgets. The euro area is the most vulnerable to these problems. Banks there have a lot of debt to refinance because of their heavy reliance on wholesale funding, a large portion of which matures in the next two years. Their sovereign exposures, legacy asset problems, as well as weak business models leave their funding highly sensitive to confidence shocks and increase the size of capital buffers they need to ensure open access to funding markets. In the United States, concerns about household balance sheets and real estate markets continue to cloud the outlook for loan quality in the banking sector. Second, **elevated sovereign risks** exacerbate financial sector vulnerabilities. Financial markets continue to focus on not only high public debt burdens, but also the exposure of national financial systems to sovereign debt, and fewer resources are available to support the economic recovery and financial stability. Encouragingly, governments have begun to develop and, in some cases implement, plans to reduce budget deficits and debt levels over the medium term. However, sovereign debt is expected to remain at unprecedented levels for many years. And, if there were to be another big decline in growth, we see a risk that debt levels could rise even further. These medium-term debt sustainability concerns can lead to short-term sovereign funding difficulties, and sharply higher funding costs, especially as many advanced economy governments have both sizeable rollover needs and large deficits. The recent experience in Europe illustrates the danger that these weaknesses'in both sovereign and financial balance sheets'if not addressed, could easily reignite asset sell-off pressures and cause highly damaging spillovers between countries and financial centers. So what are the policy priorities? For the advanced economies, I think action is needed on four fronts:**** * The first of these is the need for further progress on the regulatory reform front. As I [wrote about this a couple of days ago, I won't dwell on the issue here. Suffice to say, these reforms need to be stepped up if we are to move toward a much safer financial system. * Second, policymakers should tackle the problem of high public debt and sovereign balance sheets risks by putting in place ambitious and credible medium-term strategies to lower fiscal deficits and reverse the rise in debt levels. These should take into account country-specific circumstances, and be accompanied where necessary by growth-enhancing structural reforms. Contingent liabilities must be managed and reduced in the medium term, including by ensuring that significant public or private financial enterprises do not enjoy implicit taxpayer support. Market discipline needs to be brought back. * Third, they should address the remaining vulnerabilities in the banking system and they should resolve and restructure weak banks in order to provide their national banking systems with enough capital and liquidity to be able to support the economic recovery. Also, a key message from the GFSR is that capital buffers for some European banks should be increased to reduce vulnerabilities to renewed funding stress and to protect against downside risks. * Fourth, central banks and governments should remain open to providing financial support, if and when needed, given the risks to the outlook. Exit strategies should also be contingent on adequate progress on the stability front. The sooner the financial system stabilizes, the sooner policy support can be unwound. For emerging market policymakers, the main challenge will be to tackle the macroeconomic and financial challenges of sizable, and potentially volatile, capital inflows. Targeted use of prudential tools'like loan-to-value ratios'can help to reduce pressures on credit markets, in combination with flexible use of macroeconomic policies. Measures should also focus on continuing to develop local capital markets, as well as reinforcing regulatory and supervisory frameworks to help ensure that local financial systems are able to absorb, and safely and efficiently intermediate higher capital flows. **** Persevering with such wide-ranging reforms may well seem daunting, especially several years into our efforts. But there is a long road ahead of us. And only with concerted action at the national level and collaboration at the global level can we keep the economic recovery firmly on track.

On the bright side, the crisis has provided the impetus for a major overhaul of the financial regulatory system. So, are we making the most of this opportunity to fix the system? Three years into this crisis, the good news is that policymakers have made important progress in some areas, and the work underway is moving in the right direction. The bad news is that we are barely half way there and the hardest part may lie ahead. In a new Staff Position Note, [_Shaping the New Financial System_, we examine just how far we've come and, more importantly, how much further we have to go. Indeed, unless we'the collective 'we'\u009d'make concrete progress over the next 12 months in a few key areas, we may well sow the seeds of the next financial crisis. What are the guiding principles of this urgent work? The first is to build a financial system that provides a solid foundation for strong and sustainable economic growth; one that satisfies, first and foremost, the needs of households and firms. The second is to address the risks posed by the entire financial system, not just banks. The recent proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision represent a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of bank capital, but these apply only to a subset of the financial system, and they don't yet include macroprudential considerations, that is, systemic issues and the impact of the business cycle on how financial institutions function. Real progress is therefore needed over the next year in several key areas'areas where much has been said, but less accomplished. The financial sector remains the Achilles' Heel of the global recovery. Prompt action is essential to alleviate regulatory uncertainty, which is acting as a drag on credit and economic growth, and to reduce the likelihood of another crisis. Policymakers need to make progress in the following five areas: * **Ensuring a level playing field in regulation**.** **Global coordination is needed to foster competition and minimize the scope for regulatory arbitrage. * **Improving the effectiveness of supervision**. Better supervision is necessary to prevent a new cycle of leveraging and excessive risk taking. Supervision needs to be intensive, intrusive, and more focused on cross-border exposures. * **Developing coherent resolution mechanisms**. At the national level, the IMF has proposed a 'financial stability contribution'\u009d to pay for the fiscal cost of any future government support. At the international level, we have proposed a 'pragmatic'\u009d cross-border coordination framework. As a first step, we suggest making this pragmatic approach operational among a subset of countries that are home to most cross-border financial institutions. This is critical for addressing the problem of 'too important to fail.'\u009d * **Establishing a comprehensive macroprudential framework**. Microprudential regulations, which aim to improve the resilience of individual institutions, must be accompanied by macroprudential regulations that strengthen the resilience of the system as a whole. This means identifying, monitoring, and addressing procyclicality and systemic risks generated by the individual and collective behavior of firms. * **Casting a wide net**.** **Regulation and supervision must capture the entire financial system, not just the banks. Absent a broader perspective, riskier activities and products will surely migrate to the less (or un-) regulated segments of the system. More than just focusing on the right issues with sufficient vigor, the official sector needs 'buy in' from the private sector for these new rules. This will require rules that encourage the industry to reduce their collective risk taking, through better risk measurement and risk management, and with boards of directors that are empowered to rein in excessive risk taking, and be held accountable for it. Finally, since the issues are complex and involve many conflicting interests, we need political commitment at the highest levels. To borrow from the success of the Nike spirit in the corporate world, policymakers need to 'just do it'\u009d.

And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets'in theory.** In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability'in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors. In [one of the background papers for the Fall 2010 _Global Financial Stability Report_ that I prepared with IMF colleagues, we recommend that regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings. Credit ratings should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one. Instead, credit ratings, which measure the relative risk that an entity such as a government or a company will fail to meet its financial commitments, have become hardwired into various rules, regulations and triggers. Central banks often use ratings in their collateral acceptability rules. The Basel II standardized approach to determining bank capital requirements relies heavily on ratings. And, many institutional investors'pension funds, insurance companies, retirement funds, and the like'have rules that trigger the sale of securities when they are downgraded below certain levels. Yet, when investors, regulators and borrowers rely on credit ratings too mechanically, changes in ratings, particularly abrupt downgrades, can lead to deleterious selloffs of securities. Not only does this create the potential for broader spillovers, but the resulting declines in the prices of securities trigger further sell-offs. In other words, those notorious domino effects! Actions by ratings agencies to 'smooth out'\u009d or make changes in ratings less abrupt'for example, through a warnings ahead of a possible downgrade'may be intended to minimize disruptions. However, they we find that much of the market reaction occurs when these warnings are released rather than when the actual rating changes. And, as events of the past year or so have highlighted, sovereign ratings could have taken better account of debt composition and contingent liabilities. However, in some cases'Greece for example'the rating agencies did not have access to all the information they needed. In that regard, the IMF encourages countries to prepare and make publicly available a fiscal risk statement. Still, the real solution lies in reducing the reliance on credit ratings as much as possible. This should start with removing the mechanistic use of ratings in rules and regulations, which some countries are already beginning to do. Investors must be weaned off credit ratings too. Policymakers should persuade the larger ones, at least, to perform their own risk assessments as part of deciding what to buy or sell. Realistically, of course, not all investors have the same 'in house' capacity for risk assessment. Smaller and less sophisticated institutions will have to continue to rely heavily on third-party ratings. So, the process of reducing reliance on ratings should differentiate according to the size and sophistication of institutions, and the instruments being rated. Also, agencies'the main ones being Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch'whose ratings continue to play key regulatory roles (as in the Basel II standardized approach) should be subjected to increased oversight. (Both of these approaches were included in the recently signed U.S. financial sector reform legislation.) Beyond this, our [paper recommends that policymakers should also continue to push rating agencies to improve their procedures, including those related to transparency and governance. This will provide more assurance to those that use ratings that they are fairly constructed. Credit rating agencies aggregate information about the credit quality of various types of borrowers and their financial obligations. The ratings they issue allow many of those borrowers to access global and domestic markets they would not otherwise have, enabling them to attract investment funds. As a result, ratings add liquidity to markets that would otherwise be highly illiquid. Wringing out the volatility, without drying up the liquidity, is the goal of any effort to reform the credit ratings agencies that issue them.

The EWE was intended to fill the analytical gap: the goal is to produce an effective 'call to arms'\u009d as threats emerge'but well before crises erupt. That the IMF would be called upon in these circumstances isn't surprising, it was a confirmation of one of the Fund's responsibilities. After all, assessing macroeconomic and financial risks constitutes a core task of the Fund's surveillance activities. The Fund's primary multilateral analysis as presented in the _[World Economic Outlook_ (WEO), _[Global Financial Stability Report_[ (GFSR), and _[Fiscal Monitor_[ publications traditionally addresses the principal risks to the staff's baseline global forecast. Assessing risks also forms a central aspect of bilateral surveillance, and a section of IMF country reports discusses the principal risks to the outlook. Thus, the IMF's macro-financial expertise, analytical talent and data resources'together with Financial Stability Board's breadth of knowledge regarding both financial regulation and supervision' were viewed as key and complementary ingredients. From the IMF's perspective, the EWE is best understood in contrast with 'traditional'\u009d surveillance products. The WEO/GFSR analysis incorporates directly those risks to the baseline outlook that are sufficiently probable that they need to be taken into account explicitly in setting policy. The EWE, in contrast, focuses on tail risks (i.e., risks that may not be relevant for policy-setting at present, but that could become important). The goal is to identify the most relevant tail risks, to demonstrate how the possible emergence of these risks could be recognized, and to specify the policy changes that would need to be implemented if they were to materialize. ### Gaining experience By now, the exercise has been repeated several times, and the results have been presented to meetings of the Fund's International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), comprising finance ministers and central bank governors. While the content of the exercise remains confidential'in order to facilitate the most candid exchange of views, and to avoid any confusion regarding the Fund's base case forecast'a [newly released paper available on the IMF's website provides an overview of the design and methodological underpinnings of the EWE. What are the main features of this exercise? * First, coverage is **fairly comprehensive**, including both advanced and emerging economies. Moreover, work is underway to extend the exercise to low-income countries and to deepen the understanding of how crises spread. * Second, the EWE is based on **a holistic approach to assessing risk**. While it is based on rigorous analysis and cutting-edge techniques, it draws on various tools, rather than relying on a single crisis model. * Third, the EWE **combines empirical analysis with forward-looking thinking**, based on inputs from key policymakers and academics, in-depth real-world knowledge (e.g., from market practitioners), and seasoned judgment from IMF experts. Broad consultation is intended to avoid 'fighting the last war'\u009d. * Fourth, the exercise does not aim to predict the timing of crises, but rather to **help prevent their occurrence and to limit their potential damage**. Indeed, history has taught us that crisis triggers are highly unpredictable. The primary purpose of the EWE is to identify as early as possible the buildup of underlying vulnerabilities that predispose a system to a crisis, so that corrective policies can be implemented and contingency plans put in place. Effective communication will be critical if the EWE is to fulfill its role successfully. Providing credible intelligence to policymakers that will elicit action requires more than simply identifying risks and vulnerabilities. Warnings need to be precise and compelling, consist of serious but plausible scenarios, outline the consequences of inaction, and lead to specific policy advice. Indeed, a major failure prior to the recent crisis'that the EWE is designed to correct'was the inability of analysts to 'connect the dots'\u009d among the many vulnerabilities in different parts of the global financial system, and to propose policy options to address them. However, the dissemination of EWE outcomes does not end with the presentation to policymakers at the IMFC. The EWE's analyses and conclusions also have become a valuable input for the IMF staff's bilateral discussions with country authorities. The main results and policy implications relevant for the respective country typically are presented and discussed, and the gist of such discussions is reflected in documents relating to the annual Article IV consultations. ### Work in progress In summary, the Early Warning Exercise draws together an impressive combination of analytical techniques, practical experience, seasoned judgment and unique databases in order to think through the potential consequences associated with economic and financial tail risks. It is not a crisis forecasting exercise, but forms a valuable complement to the IMF's multilateral and bilateral surveillance work. Reflecting its relatively short history, it represents a work in progress'both the IMF and FSB participants continue to refine the process and content. The ultimate task is clear, however: Make sure that available knowledge is focused systematically and effectively on reducing the risk of a new global crisis.

The world's economies are now closely interconnected, and the fate of those in poor countries is tied, increasingly, to that of the richest. These interconnections have helped propel rapid growth in the developing world over the past decade, and for much longer than that in the emerging market economies. Sadly, this also meant that, when the global financial crisis hit'close on the heels of the food and fuel shocks of 2007-8'the poor countries took a severe blow. With only five years to go until the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the poverty reduction agenda has been set back. All is not lost, however. Reducing poverty on a massive scale **_is_** do-able'the number of people living in extreme poverty fell by a staggering 400 million from 1990 to 2005. We've done it before and we can do it again. The question is, how do we regain the momentum? It won't be easy and, as a global problem, it will require a shared effort between the developing countries themselves, the advanced economies, and the international organizations. With this challenge in mind, the IMF Managing Director is participating in this week's [United Nations Millennium Development Goals summit. And IMF staff has prepared a [background paper on the macroeconomic foundations needed to attain the MDGs. One thing is certain. Everything hinges on restoring balanced, sustainable, global growth. The advanced economies, and indeed the leading emerging markets, should focus first and foremost on getting the growth engine up and running again to secure a sustainable global recovery. Otherwise, all other efforts on the MDGs will come to naught. Beyond that, there are two big things the richer countries can do to help. First, they must keep their Gleneagles promises on aid. They have delivered only about 60 percent of the scaled-up aid they committed five years ago, and less than half of what was promised to Africa. Second, they should unblock trade. Trade offers a fast track to prosperity, but the poorest countries have yet to benefit. They account for 1 percent of global GDP, but only \u00c2? percent of global trade, and that share hasn't changed in the past 15 years. Pretty much all of today's dynamic emerging markets rode the wave of trade to success. Today's poor countries should be afforded the same opportunity. Completing the Doha Round is important, but there are plenty of things that can be done in the interim. [We're suggesting a package of trade reforms that includes granting full duty-free and quota-free market access to the poorest countries, streamlining the complex rules surrounding trade preference schemes so that poor countries can actually take advantage of them, and tackling the distortions in rich countries' agricultural markets which depress prices for farmers in poor countries and inhibit trade. There is also plenty that the low-income countries can and should do to help themselves. Especially in Africa, these countries are badly lacking in infrastructure'notably power, but also roads and ports. And what infrastructure they have is dilapidated due to years of neglect. To overcome this major obstacle to growth, countries need to invest efficiently and devote adequate resources to maintenance. This will come at a price, of course. The World Bank has estimated that Africa will need to spend $93 billion a year to close the 'infrastructure gap'\u009d'twice what those countries are currently spending. Even if aid commitments are met, this will not be enough to fund the needed improvements. Low-income countries need to look to other sources, including domestic tax revenues, where collections currently fall well short of potential. It also means tapping private investment, both local and foreign, which in turn requires a better regulatory environment, stronger property rights, and less corruption. And it may mean more borrowing from the markets, though this is expensive and needs to be done carefully to ensure that debt problems do not recur. Low-income countries also need to rebuild the 'policy buffers'\u009d that served them so well during the crisis'by this we mean things like low debt, low inflation, and high reserves. These levies protected countries from the worst of the crisis, and they need to rebuild them before the next shock. (We will be putting out a paper on this topic next month.) They also need to strengthen social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. The IMF stands ready to help in any way it can'[policy advice, financial support, and technical assistance. We will help especially with strategies to scale up investment and to 'borrow safely.'\u009d The IMF's mandate is economic stability, an essential ingredient for strong, sustained growth. It was an historic downturn in growth that knocked us off the path to the MDGs, and it will take a strong, durable, and inclusive recovery to get us back on track.

Now, as the crisis abates, there is an emerging consensus that something needs to be done. A better safety net is needed to enable countries with _good_ policies to insure against _bad_ outcomes, especially when they are innocent bystanders caught up in a financial turmoil. Last week, the IMF took another step toward meeting this need by enhancing its country insurance facilities. Following on from [earlier reforms, the IMF Executive Board [decided to extend the safety net to a broader set of countries with sound policies and economic fundamentals, making our contingent financial support more tailored to our members' needs and circumstances. A new [staff paper and [supplement describe the main elements of these reforms. The decisions taken by our Board'the rationale for which I [wrote about earlier this year'were significant for two sets of countries. For countries with very strong policies and economic fundamentals, these reforms have made our flagship insurance option'the Flexible Credit Line (FCL)' even more attractive. And, for countries with some moderate vulnerabilities, the IMF now offers a new form of contingent protection through a new Precautionary Credit Line (PCL). [ [[ **Flexible Credit Line** So far, three countries have made use of the FCL: Mexico, Colombia, and Poland. Put in place last year during the depths of the crisis, all three FCLs have been renewed, with senior officials in these countries noting the role played by the FCL in soothing market sentiment and providing them with 'policy space'\u009d to take countercyclical measures. Experience with the FCL'as well as extensive discussions across the broader Fund membership'suggested that this credit line for our _strongest performers_ could be even more effective if we made it_ more flexible_ ('reserve-like'\u009d). Thus, we have made two principal changes. First, an FCL can be longer'up to two years, with a country's policy strength reviewed after a year'providing an increased measure of _predictability_. Second, we have removed the implicit cap on its size, allowing it to be determined by the amount of insurance that a member actually needs. **** **Precautionary Credit Line** Despite making immense strides in improving their policy frameworks, many countries still have _moderate_ residual weaknesses in, among others, fiscal and financial areas, with some susceptible to linkages to foreign banks. [In the most turbulent times during the crisis, these countries ended up lacking contingent protection. The FCL was not an available option, given its high qualification bar. While a Stand-by Arrangement was available in a precautionary form'including with high access as a result of earlier reforms'this traditional _crisis-resolution_ instrument was not used much for _crisis-prevention_ purposes by these countries, identifying a gap in our ability to serve our member countries. Thus, the PCL was born, designed to fill exactly this gap for members with sound policies. The PCL's rigorous qualification process is intended to give a 'seal of approval'\u009d regarding policy strengths in _most areas_, while also identifying residual vulnerability. Limited ex post conditions are then used to address such vulnerability, thus providing contingent financing as well as credibility to the authorities' policies. Given the sound policies of qualified members, a PCL provides a large amount of up-front access to financing: as much as 500 percent of a country's IMF quota could be available during the first year of the PCL, with up to a total of 1000 percent of quota available after a year. **A Global Financial Safety Net** Good policies and frameworks'endorsed with FCLs and PCLs'are certainly the first line of defense. However, as history and the recent crisis have shown, there are times when localized events trigger panic among investors, setting off chain reactions across markets and countries _irrespective of [fundamentals_. The intensity of investor withdrawal during the recent crisis surpassed most expectations, with normalcy returning slowly and only after _many_ forceful measures were taken by the global community, including the leaders of the Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market economies. Given this experience, what more can the Fund and the international community do? For our part, the Fund's member countries have asked its staff to explore options for overlapping layers of protection for the global economy. Reform of the Fund's lending facilities is but one layer. We are also working on establishing synergies in terms of lending and surveillance with key regional financing arrangements, and are consulting with various stakeholders. We are also considering a _Global Stabilization Mechanism_, a framework that would allow proactive provision of _financing_ during a systemic crisis to stem contagion. Our Executive Board has had a preliminary discussion and, building on this, we will be developing these ideas further in the months ahead. Thoughts from our readers are, as always, also [welcome.

Ostry **Public debt sustainability in most advanced economies used to be a non-issue, or at most a back-burner one.** A couple years back, if the topic came up, most people associated it with developing or emerging market countries. Defaults, rising sovereign risk premia, getting shut out from capital markets were, let's face it, not really imagined to be possibilities for advanced economies. Of course there were fiscal challenges, demographic pressures being the obvious one, but these were issues for the long term, not the here and now. But today, fiscal problems _are_ a key concern of policy makers in many industrial countries, and a reassessment of sovereign risk is a palpable threat to global recovery. While the financial crisis may be a convenient scapegoat for the debt blowout in the advanced countries, blame lies elsewhere, in how fiscal policy was managed before the great recession, not during it. And, more sobering still, taming public debt will require steadfast policy efforts over the medium term: quick fixes will not do the trick. What is the worry? At the heart of the issue is the extent to which governments have room for fiscal maneuver''fiscal space'\u009d'before markets force them to tighten policies sharply and, relatedly, the size of adjustments needed to restore or maintain public debt sustainability. Yet, surprisingly, much of the talk about fiscal space'how to measure it and the policy implications'has so far been rather fuzzy. A [new staff position note, which I co- authored with several IMF colleagues, aims to remedy this, providing an operational definition of the fiscal space concept as well as empirical estimates of available fiscal space for 23 advanced economies. Our estimates indicate that advanced countries are _not_ all in the same boat in terms of available fiscal space. Some have a lot, others have none, and some are in the middle. Fiscal space varies across countries for two reasons: differing indebtedness, and different debt limits. [Our results indeed underscore that there is no 'one size fits all'\u009d on these issues'debt limits and fiscal space are country-specific and depend on each country's track record of adjustment. So how did we approach these complex issues? Some have questioned the relevance of debt limits for advanced-economy sovereigns. They assume that a government's right to tax and (not) spend means that, in the future, changes in fiscal policy can always ensure that public debt is repaid. Our take is different, not least because markets will not be impressed by promises of policy change when a country has little or no track record of adjustment'words unsupported by deeds. For this reason, we focus on fiscal solvency in terms of the actual track record of countries'how policy responded in the past to changes in public debt. If governments were able to raise the primary budget balance (that is, net of interest payments) when public debt went up, then they had (at least) an implicit rule of making sure debt would be repaid. As such, markets could take comfort that, in the very long run, the sovereign would honor its financial obligations. But this finding of a positive response of the primary balance to rising debt can be true only up to a point. As debt grows, it becomes increasingly difficult'reflecting both economic and political realities'to improve the primary balance enough to offset higher debt service costs. Eventually there is a threshold'a _debt limit'_when debt simply gets too big, adjustment fatigue sets in, and the surplus cannot keep pace with rising debt repayments. Of course, markets don't usually sit idly by as debt approaches its limit. Instead they add a risk premium to the interest rate they charge to sovereigns, reflecting the potential for default. And, by adding to the cost of debt, the higher risk premium means a country will be more likely to reach its debt limit. When concerns are acute, only policy adjustments that are dramatically different from past efforts will be enough to maintain capital market access. What are the policy implications? * First, there is a definite wakeup call in the finding that a country has little or no fiscal space. In these cases, fiscal policy needs to break fundamentally from the past to credibly signal to markets that debt limits will not be reached: business as usual simply won't cut it. * But, second, a finding of little or no fiscal space does not imply that default is inevitable'debt limits are not etched in stone. Our estimates of fiscal space are based on the assumption that future policy reactions will mirror those in the past. Since behavior can change, history is not destiny as long as policy changes credibly. * Third, countries will generally want to target debt levels well below the limits. As public debt rises or views about fiscal risks'or the reliability of fiscal data'change, our results imply that markets may give little or no warning about imminent spikes in borrowing costs or curtailed access to debt markets. With the inevitable uncertainty around where precisely debt limits lie, and the potential for market perceptions to change in the bat of an eye, there is a need for caution'a few successful auctions are not grounds for complacency. Many of these points resonate with the experience of some southern European countries in recent months and underscore the need for countries to maintain a comfortable degree of fiscal space at all times. And, if fiscal risks rise, there needs to be political willingness'already evident in a number of countries'to undertake adjustment efforts that are extraordinary by historical standards, in a timely fashion, to preserve, or to restore, sustainability. We hope the framework in our note helps to bring clarity to discussions of fiscal space'getting to grips with a fuzzy concept'and that it provides a practical sense of where a change of course is called for, as well as the size and nature of adjustments needed to manage fiscal risks.

Collective action by the G-20 in response to the recent crisis was critical in avoiding a catastrophic financial meltdown and a potential second Great Depression. Exceptional policy responses around the globe'including macroeconomic stimulus and financial sector intervention'indeed helped avoid the worst. These actions were notable, both for their scale and force, but also for their consistency and coherence. Keen to build on this success, G-20 Leaders pledged at their [2009 Pittsburgh Summit to adopt policies that would ensure a lasting recovery and a brighter economic future. To meet this goal, they launched the 'Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth.'\u009d The backbone of this framework is a multilateral process, where G-20 countries together set out objectives and the policies needed to get there. And, most importantly, they undertake a 'mutual assessment'\u009d of their progress toward meeting those shared objectives. With this, the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process or the 'MAP'\u009d was born. But, what exactly will the G-20 Framework imply in terms of prospective actions? And what have we learned so far from the MAP?**** **The MAP'led and owned by the G-20** The MAP is a new approach to policy collaboration, entirely conceived and owned by G-20 members. Leaders have set the tone and substance for the initiative. The aim is to ensure that the collective policy action will benefit all. Like any new initiative, the MAP will be fully fleshed out over time, in large part through learning by doing. In the meantime, however, all G-20 members have signaled their 'buy-in'\u009d to the process through their full cooperation in providing the information required for the analysis and assessments. When the G-20 initiated the MAP, they asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide supporting technical analysis. In carrying out this task, the Fund was asked to seek help from other international institutions such as the World Bank, the OECD, the ILO and the WTO. Moreover, a G-20 Working Group (co- Chaired by Canada and India), which was established to substantively add value to each stage of the mutual assessment, has assisted the G-20 Deputies in providing guidance to the Fund and other organizations on the analysis. The initial assessment was based on three key steps. * As a first step in this process, all G-20 countries supplied each other and Fund staff with information about their 'policy and macroeconomic frameworks'\u009d'that is, their policy plans and the expected performance of their economies over the next 3-5 years. * Fund staff aggregated the inputs to assess whether the policies were consistent on a 'multilateral'\u009d basis. And also what they implied for growth, employment, poverty, and so on. This formed the basis for the G-20 '_base case_'\u009d scenario. In keeping with the G-20 ownership of the exercise, individual country policies were taken at face value and no judgments were made by IMF staff concerning their feasibility, timing, or effectiveness. * Once the _base case_ assessment was considered by the G-20, Fund staff liaised closely with the Working Group to [analyze alternative policy scenarios. A key objective of this exercise was to show how the economic outcomes could be improved through collective action by G-20 members. **Providing the foundation'the G-20 'base case_'\u009d_** The G-20 _base case_ collectively implied 'strong'\u009d growth. This enabled a decline in unemployment, which would, nevertheless, still remain quite high for several years. Growth was projected to be 'balanced'\u009d, since it was broad- based across the G-20 countries. Finally, growth was expected to be 'sustainable,'\u009d since it was led by private demand. The analysis, however, pointed to some shortcomings and risks. Budget balances in the _base case_ were projected to improve noticeably, helped by strong growth. But deficits and debt levels would still remain high in the large advanced economies. Moreover, there is a risk that if strong growth projected in the submissions by the large advanced economies did not materialize, fiscal positions in these economies could worsen significantly and even trigger another crisis. The forecasts were also associated with only a modest rebalancing of global demand. Countries with large current account deficits before the crisis did not expect a significant boost to growth from exports. And countries with large surpluses did not expect a significant boost from domestic demand. **Alternative policy scenarios'benefits of collective action** Based on the findings of the '_base case_'\u009d assessment, the G-20 asked IMF staff to explore two [alternative policy scenarios. First, an _'upside scenario'\u009d_ and associated policy requirements that would help improve the outlook. Second, a _'downside scenario'\u009d _aimed at assessing the implications of the risks identified in the _base case_, if they were to materialize. Prior to carrying out the scenario analysis, Fund staff made technical refinements to the G-20 _base case_. This was made for two reasons. First, to ensure greater multilateral consistency in assessing the impact of the crisis and the estimation of output gaps; and Second, to update the macroeconomic frameworks for economic and market developments since the submission of G-20 inputs. The 'upside'\u009d scenario assessed'in a layered approach'the cumulative benefits of three sets of policy actions for groups of countries with similar circumstances. * First, 'growth-friendly'\u009d and credible fiscal consolidation in major advanced economies, beginning in 2011 and beyond countries' existing medium-term plans. Fiscal consolidation plans were conceived to be strong, credible, and, to the extent possible, supportive of growth. * Second, policies aimed at nurturing domestic demand in emerging economies with large external surpluses. These were aimed at offsetting the loss of demand as advanced economies further tightened their fiscal positions in coming years. * Third, structural reform policies aimed at alleviating supply constraints and reducing high unemployment, particularly in advanced G-20 economies, along with measures to boost demand. The key takeaway from this exercise is that well-designed, collaborative policy actions by the G-20 economies can produce outcomes that will make everyone better off. For instance, considered in isolation, fiscal consolidation in advanced economies would dampen growth in the next year or two. And it would have a lasting adverse impact on partners in emerging Asia, given their high export dependence. But all G-20 countries stand to gain when fiscal consolidation in advanced economies is accompanied by key reforms in emerging economies. Benefits to all countries increase further when all three sets of policies noted above are undertaken together. Indeed, our simulations suggested that the payoff for collective policy action by G-20 countries could be high, raising global GDP by an estimated 2\u00c2? percent over the medium-term. This would also be good news for job creation and poverty reduction. The 'downside'\u009d scenario assessed the implications of the risks identified in the G-20 _base case_. What if growth in major advanced economies was lower than projected or what if market concerns about fiscal sustainability led to a sharp increase in sovereign risk premia? Not surprisingly, the outcome could be quite scary. There would be significant output and employment losses, with a large number of people falling into poverty. At the same time, it is clear that the implementation of the policies needed to reach the upside scenario would likely reduce the probability of such a downside scenario occurring. **So, where to next?** Reflecting on this assessment, [G-20 Leaders agreed at the Toronto Summit in June 2010 that they could do a better job of achieving the objective of strong, balanced and sustainable growth by working together and pursuing reforms along those lines. Leaders committed to taking stronger policy actions that would get the world economy closer to the 'upside'\u009d scenario in the staff's report. This set the stage for the second phase of the process, where the mutual assessment will be conducted at the country and regional level. During this phase, each G-20 member will identify policy actions that could help achieve an ambitious outcome of stronger growth than in the _base case_. These 'country-level'\u009d policy plans will form the basis for a comprehensive plan that will be articulated by Leaders at the Seoul Summit this November. As the G-20 moves forward with this shared approach to tackling today's policy challenges, they have a unique opportunity to deliver a better outcome for all. ______________________ 1 This is a good opportunity to thank the Fund staff analysis team, led by Krishna Srinivasan and Hamid Faruqee, for their outstanding work.

What is clear is that the new landscape will be influenced by both the private and public sectors'their reactions to the crisis and to each other. There are a multitude of possibilities between two extremes. * Having skirted systemic collapse'in part due to extraordinary official interventions'the difficult reform agenda could succumb to stiff private sector pushback, languishing and allowing vulnerabilities to become re-entrenched. * At the other extreme, the depth of the wounds inflicted by the crisis and resulting public outcry could lead to over-regulation, stifled creativity and innovation, and sluggish economic growth. Neither outcome is desirable, so the note presents a base case between the two. What is needed is not more regulation, but [sensible and better regulation. The attitude that 'regulation never works, so why bother'\u009d misses two of the main lessons from the crisis. * First, regulatory reforms are only part of a solution (and weak regulation was only part of the problem). A more macroprudential approach'more attention to the financial system as a whole rather than its individual parts'is needed. * Second, even when regulation is the right tool or is already in place, it is implementation that really matters. This in turn depends on [strong supervision. Although perfect regulation is the ideal, in the real world there is unlikely to be a perfect, gleaming Emerald City at the end of a yellow brick road. Nor is there a 'great and all-powerful Oz'\u009d to devise and implement such regulation. Hence we look at the most likely set of reforms to be enacted'those that are perhaps the most politically feasible and globally acceptable'and their effects. We then speculate about what the main outcomes will be: * Banks will return to a more traditional function, faced with stricter regulations that limit the risks they can undertake and, as a result, their returns'making banking systems smaller overall. * Banking systems may look more segmented, with some banks returning to their deposit-taking/loan-making roots and other banks becoming more diversified and interconnected continuing to challenge the moniker of 'too-important-to-fail.'\u009d * Nonbanks will fill the void left by banks. The diverse range of nonbank institutions will have a competitive advantage by both supplying credit and providing investors with much needed riskier investments to satisfy their retirement needs. * The regulatory perimeter will need to expand. Nonbank financial institutions'at least those seen as systemically important'should be covered. But the issue of exactly how to formulate regulations that mitigates the systemic risks they pose is going nowhere fast. * Market infrastructure, especially for markets thought to be susceptible to runs or contagion, will be improved by moving the 'offending'\u009d instruments (either voluntarily or by mandate) to central counterparties where such risks can be partially mitigated. * More transparent and simpler instruments will be demanded, especially by those who lost money in the crisis on products that in hindsight were too complex to understand or price. But what does this mean for the global financial system as a whole? In the short run, the system's riskiness and size will likely continue to shrink alongside a prolonged period of deleveraging. In the medium term, the outcomes become less clear. If the largely bank-centric regulations currently on the drawing board come to pass, and the expanded nonbank activities are within a new regulatory perimeter, it could bring financial system risk back toward a healthier norm but, importantly, with less risk than in the pre-crisis period. But, to get to a safer, sounder financial system, coordinated and consistent implementation of better, smarter regulation and oversight will be needed. We at Fund are working hard to put our relative strengths'namely our global vantage point, our extensive experience with financial sector reform, and existing partnerships with major international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International Accounting Standards Board'to work in helping guide the development of the 'just right'\u009d version of re-regulation. While a more holistic and coordinated approach across countries'with not too many countries jumping ahead nor lagging behind'is desirable, it is by no means assured. There is also a risk that, without buy-in from the private sector through 'incentive compatible'\u009d regulation that encourages them to mitigate risks on their own, regulations put in place will be circumvented. So, just as the scarecrow's new brain and the lion's new courage helped them guide Dorothy on her journey to find Oz, similar wisdom is needed in shaping the new financial system. It is critical that reforms are introduced with intelligence and foresight, as well as a firmness of purpose so that policymakers can navigate their way through the lessons from the crisis and we do not lose our way again.

It wasn't always like that.** Not so long ago, high and volatile inflation routinely raised its ugly head and threatened living standards. Some of us even remember those days! It wasn't pleasant. But since then, an effective antidote has pretty much wiped out rampant price instability. Over the past three decades, better monetary frameworks have caused the level and volatility of inflation to fall sharply. These frameworks enshrined price stability as the main monetary policy objective, and provided independence and constrained discretion in the pursuit of this objective, often set out through formal inflation targets. As I said, it worked out well. Or did it? In reality, there was a gaping hole in the system. While monetary policy frameworks fortified the castle against inflation at the front, they didn't pay much attention to back door vulnerabilities. I'm talking about financial stability. Quite simply, price stability and financial stability are not always aligned, and are even sometimes at odds with each other. Financial stability comes under threat when rising credit feeds asset price bubbles, which in turn feed unsustainable booms in consumption and investment. But the monetary policy frameworks might not sound the alarm, as consumer prices might be stable while this is happening. This can continue for a number of years, until the financial bubble bursts and threatens not only the financial system, but the real economy and price stability too. We saw this clearly in the current crisis. So how can we align price and financial stability? One answer is to simply add financial stability as a separate objective for monetary policy. But this marriage of convenience could easily end in divorce'it would cause conflict, and both objectives could be missed, making a serious dent in the central bank's credibility. There is a better way. This involves linking prudential tools to macrofinancial developments'this is an important part of what we mean by 'macroprudential'\u009d policy. Prudential tools should be sharpened to counter the build-up of financial imbalances at their root. [Policy frameworks should make effective use of these tools. This way, monetary and prudential policies will live in harmony. While prudential policy comes first in the pursuit of financial stability, monetary policy also supports financial stability when consistent with price stability. But to do this, policymakers must get a better grasp of how monetary policy ultimately affects output and inflation and how this is in turn affected by financial developments, both domestically and globally. Increasing global trade and financial linkages over the past two decades have complicated things across a variety of dimensions. For a start, in many economies domestic long-term rates are now determined more by international demand for domestic financial assets, and central banks' ability to move them is more limited. Second, the pressure from foreign-financed consumption can be released through current account deficits rather than inflation. And third, it was global, not local, liquidity that mainly lay behind the build-up of financial imbalances'especially in smaller countries, differences between local and global rates enticed capital inflows, and this only fueled the fire. This is all complicated, and needs further analysis. In the meantime, I think we can derive the following broad conclusions: * Prudential policies must be the first defense against credit-fueled asset booms. This is a powerful tool, and it doesn't depend on whether the boom is driven by capital inflows or funded domestically. * Monetary policy can help by non-mechanistically 'leaning'\u009d against the build-up of financial imbalances, such as credit booms which finance asset bubbles. Of course, it should not lean too far'everything must stay consistent with price stability. * In general, the response depends on circumstances. It's less about mechanics and more about judgment, making use of all available information. * By paying closer attention to financial stability in the pursuit of price stability over the medium term, monetary policy can become more symmetric during the cycle. This means more 'leaning'\u009d in good times and the need for 'less cleaning'\u009d in bad times once bubbles explode. So then, there is still much work to be done in developing a new policy framework to marry monetary and financial stability. Of course, each policy framework has its own nature'monetary policy aims mainly at price stability and prudential policies strive after financial stability. But we need a better and more enduring relationship between the two, and this will be the great challenge going forward.

On July 12 and 13, more than 1,000 officials, economists, bankers, analysts, and media assembled for a conference titled [Asia 21: Leading the Way Forward, hosted by the Korean government and the IMF. I personally learned a great deal about Asia's growing stake in the global economy'and the global economy's growing stake in Asia. As the world strives to leave the crisis behind, the economic center of gravity is shifting increasingly eastwards, and Asia's role is more vital than ever before. Our objectives with this conference, jointly organized with the superb help of our Korean partners, were three-fold: * to discuss the lessons of Asia's experience during this crisis'and what it might mean for other regions; * to learn about Asia's new leadership role in global economic policy'epitomized by Korea's leadership of the G'20 this year, the first emerging market country to play that role; * and to renew the Asia-IMF relationship, which has suffered from memories related to the Asian Crisis from more than a decade ago. What did we learn in these three areas? 1\\. **Asia's Economic Resilience.** There was consensus in Daejeon that Asia has emerged from the crisis as an economic powerhouse. While initially hit hard, Asia has been able to bounce back quickly and return to a strong growth path'7 \u00c2\u00be percent in 2010 relative to 4\u00c2? percent for the rest of the world and about 1\u00c2? percent for Europe. Why such Asian resilience? Part of the answer is certainly the wide range of macroeconomic, financial and corporate sector reforms implemented over the last decade. These reforms began, painfully, during the Asian Crisis'but they have been sustained since then and there is no doubt they have helped Asia withstand the brunt of the crisis. That is a lesson for the rest of the world. Nor is there any complacency in Asia about the challenges ahead. I was struck by the recognition among Asian policymakers and experts that, looking ahead, Asia must continue to build its 'second engine of growth'\u009d'based on domestic investment and consumption'beyond its clear strength in exports. This is especially the case given that some of Asia's leading trade partners'in Europe and the U.S.'may be entering a period of relatively low growth. There was also a lot of discussion'including among Asian business leaders at the conference'that the big issues of poverty and inequality in the region must be addressed if Asia's progress is to be sustained deep into the 21st century. Interesting to me was that most participants in the conference were confident that today's low-income countries in Asia comprise the 'next generation'\u009d of the world's emerging markets. Many of these poorer countries are implementing the policies needed to develop, grow and'a point of emphasis'attract capital flows in a sustainable way. 2\\. **Asia's New Leadership in Global Economic Policymaking.** As Asia's economic weight in the world is rising, its voice and representation on the global economic policymaking stage is rising too. There are six Asian nations among the G'20, and Korea is leading the way toward what promises to be a pivotal G'20 summit in Seoul this November. In particular, Korea has placed the issue of strengthening the global financial safety net high on the Seoul agenda. At the Daejeon conference, senior Korean officials including Il Sakong (Chairman of Korea's G'20 summit presidential commission) and Finance Minister Jeung-Hyun Yoon, emphasized the urgent need for enhancing global liquidity provision. Asians at the conference were acutely aware that, as the region becomes increasingly globalized, it is also becoming increasingly exposed to spillovers from other regions. This, in turn, increases the imperative of Asia being able to influence the policies of other major economies in order to secure strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Based on recent IMF analysis, for example, enhanced global policy cooperation'now being furthered through the [G'20's mutual assessment process'could result in about $250 billion more in economic growth for Asia over the next five years'and 14 million more jobs. So Asians fully understand that having an effective voice in global economic policymaking is not an option in the 21st century, but rather a necessity. And they are clearly making excellent progress in this area. 3\\. **The Evolving Asia-IMF Relationship.** From the beginning, it was my hope that the conference might serve as a platform for a renewal of Asia's relationship with the IMF. We spoke frankly about the lessons we at the IMF have learned from the Asian Crisis, and how those lessons have helped to change the way we work. A few points that I mentioned during the discussions included: more focused conditionality, a better understanding of balance sheet effects, increased front-loading of resources in a crisis, and greater emphasis on the human costs of economic adjustment. While I would certainly not claim that all the criticisms of the IMF or bad memories have been eliminated, I will say that I was greatly encouraged that the IMF has learnt the lessons of the past and that it is time to focus on how the Fund might be an even more effective partner for Asia in the future. Our discussions helped in the sharing of a set of follow-up actions that, I believe, will significantly strengthen our relationship. I called these the ['Daejeon Deliverables'\u009d and they focus on three main areas: (i) **To make the IMF's analysis more useful and available to Asia:** more focused on early warning of risks, spillover effects and cross-cutting themes, and macro-financial dimensions. In addition'it is clear to me'there is a strong perception in Asia that our analysis and surveillance is not 'even- handed'\u009d enough in terms of our treatment of various countries and regions. So we need to do a better job there too. (ii) **To strengthen the global financial safety net.** In its efforts in this area, the IMF is working closely with Asia'via Korea's leadership of the G'20'and we are listening to Asia's voice to help ensure that its needs will be better reflected in the way the safety net is constructed. We are currently exploring several options to strengthen our financing tools to help prevent crises and mitigate systemic shocks, including more tailored crisis prevention facilities and multi-country approaches. These tools would usefully complement countries' own efforts at insuring themselves against shocks, and may also include cooperation with regional financing mechanisms. There was a great deal of discussion of this 'global safety net'\u009d issue in Daejeon and, in my view, a great deal of support for the concept. (iii) **To support the further strengthening of Asia's role and voice in the global economy. **This can be done, first of all, by completing the package of so-called 'quota'\u009d reforms that will boost Asia's voting power in the IMF. My hope is that this can be achieved by the time of the Seoul summit. In addition, the Fund plans to strengthen its collaboration with Asian regional organizations and to help facilitate'where appropriate'Asia's rising regional and global cooperation efforts. Whilst in Korea, I had the privilege of meeting with President Lee to discuss G'20 issues. I also met with young students from all over the region''the future of Asia.'\u009d In these discussions, as well as during the conference itself, I expressed the hope that Asia might come to feel much greater ownership of the IMF and that that the Fund is really serving Asian interests. Indeed, I said that I hoped that the Fund might be seen as a 'second home'\u009d for the region'and one Asian colleague even reciprocated by saying perhaps Asia can also become a second home for the Fund! I don't expect this to happen overnight. But from my perspective, the IMF is ready to do all we can to make it a reality and I encouraged my Asian colleagues to do likewise. Our cooperation can only be effective if it is a two-way street. The conference certainly advanced our mutual agenda in that respect. Just as there is a new Asia, there is a new IMF too.

The conference, entitled [_Asia 21: Leading the Way Forward_, is an opportune time to reflect on exactly that: Asian leadership. Both the [topics to be discussed and participants expected for the event speak volumes of the range and depth of expertise and experience in the region. With broader recognition of the region's economic, analytic and policy successes, Asia is now a leading voice in the global dialogue on economic and financial policies. ### Economic powerhouse Asia is already an economic powerhouse and will continue to rise in global importance. In many respects the figures are staggering. Today, the region accounts for over half the world's population and more than 25 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP). Twenty years from now, Asia's economies will likely represent more than 40 percent of global GDP, and they will be larger than the US and EU combined. Asia's openness has been a large part of its recipe for success, but this also meant that it felt the ripple effects of the latest global crisis. However, extensive reforms over the past decade and sound economic policy management has helped the region stage a relatively quick recovery. [Our latest outlook sees Asia growing by about 7\u00c2\u00be percent this year (up about \u00c2? a percentage point from what we envisaged in April), led by 10\u00c2? percent growth in China. ### Benefits of regionalism But, Asia's resilience during the recent global financial crisis has also reminded us of the benefits of regional cooperation and institution building. As no country or region stands alone in today's global economy, policymakers must work together to reduce our susceptibility to crises and secure a sustainable recovery. In this regard, two aspects of Asia's approach resonate. * First, intraregional economic monitoring and analysis have gained momentum in Asia, providing a deeper understanding of the interlinkages between countries and potential shocks. * Second, the role of Asia's regional financial mechanisms'including the strengthening of the Chiang Mai Initiative last March'together with tapping arrangements outside the region (such as the swap line facility with the US Federal Reserve) in response to the crisis demonstrate how policy coordination can help form a more effective global financial safety net. ### International engagement and prominence Together, Asia's economic strength'and the policy lessons and regional cooperation that helped secure it'give the region the happy advantage of being able to lead by example. As a consequence, it is successfully increasing its global prominence, and often by engaging in the type of collaborative multilateral dialogue that has a long tradition in the region. We see this with Asia's standing in the G'20. Six [G-20 members hail from the region'Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. Top that off with Korea chairing the group this year, the first emerging market to do so since the crisis and at a time when, as [Barry Eichengreen describes it, the G'20 has 'emerged as the steering committee for the world economy'\u009d. The [G-20 mutual assessment process (MAP) bears the hallmarks of Asia's style of collaborative economic analysis. Asia is also contributing to the reform process through its representation on major standard setting bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee. And, Asia assumed an important role as a contributor of financial assistance during the global financial crisis. Several Asian countries agreed to bolster the Fund's lending capacity in the context of pledges to expand the IMF's [New Arrangements to Borrow. Japan was the first, [providing $100 billion, and was quickly joined by Korea, China, India, and Singapore. **Something old is new again** With all this talk of collaboration, the vision of the Fund's forefathers is impressive. The purpose of the Fund, stated clearly in the [Articles of Agreement, is to 'promote international monetary cooperation through'\u00a6..consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems'\u009d. Sixty-five years later we at the IMF have an enormous opportunity to draw on Asia's experiences and re-energize the collaborative nature of this institution. And, to do that, we are working to revamp the IMF's governance structures this year to better reflect the new global economic order and increase Asia's voice in the IMF's governance. We also need to continue our efforts to increase the presence of Asian staff at the IMF. But, to truly hear what Asia has to say, we must also change _how_ we interact with our members in Asia. At the IMF, we see an enormous opportunity to benefit from Asia's experiences, for example, in considering options to improve the financial safety net and how to form a more effective network of peer assessment by building on the G-20 MAP. The world needs Asian leadership not only to sustain global growth, but also to develop policy mechanisms to contend with tomorrow's realities. As my IMF colleagues and I gather here in [Daejeon with many luminaries from the region'senior policymakers, prominent business leaders, financial market experts, academics and civil society'we have an important opportunity to reinvent how the IMF and Asia collaborate in facing global economic challenges. ", "index": 697}, {"pub": "7/9/2010", "title": "Continuing the Momentum\u00e2\u20ac\u0094Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u0099s Updated Economic Outlook", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1546", "content": " By [Anoop Singh **Asia's leadership of the global economic recovery is continuing unabated.** And, even though heightened risks mean there may be tough times ahead again, the region is well equipped to handle them. Asia's remarkably fast recovery from the global financial crisis continued in the first half of 2010, despite the recent tensions in global financial markets. In fact, GDP growth in the first quarter was generally stronger than we anticipated in our [_Regional Economic Outlook_ in April. And high-frequency indicators suggest that Asian economic activity remained brisk in the second quarter. Even more notable, this is true both for economies that escaped a recession in 2009, thanks to their relatively larger domestic demand bases (China, Indonesia, and India), and for the more export-oriented economies such as Japan, the Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs), and the rest of the ASEAN. **Two growth engines** What explains the strong economic momentum across the region? It is simple. The two 'engines of growth'\u009d that spurred Asia's recovery in 2009' exports and private domestic demand'have remained robust in 2010. Exports have been boosted by the global and domestic inventory cycles, and by the sustained recovery of final demand in advanced economies. Private domestic demand has also continue to grow strongly across the region, despite some easing in policy stimulus, as well as increased volatility in capital inflows and equity valuations after the Euro area financial turmoil. In particular, private fixed investment has strengthened in many regional economies, on the back of higher capacity utilization and still relatively low capital costs. After the very rapid growth rates we have seen in the first half of 2010, we believe that growth will settle to a slightly more moderate'and, importantly, more sustainable'path for the rest of this year and 2011. To be sure, many governments in the region are expected to continue making policy conditions less accommodative, but this will occur at a very gradual pace'one that is unlikely to hinder private sector demand. And, even once the inventory cycles at home and abroad have run their full course, production and exports will likely continue to grow at a healthy pace as long as the global recovery proceeds as we envisage in the [July update of the _[World Economic Outlook._ **Still strong growth outlook** Against this background, we now expect GDP in Asia to grow by about 7\u00c2\u00be percent in 2010, about \u00c2? a percentage point above what we envisaged in April_, _before easing to about 6\u00c2\u00be percent in 2011. The pace and drivers of growth will continue to differ across the region. In China, based on the strong rebound in exports and resilient domestic demand, the economy is now forecast to grow by 10\u00c2? percent in 2010, before slowing to 9\u00c2? percent in 2011 as further measures are taken to limit credit growth and maintain financial stability. In India, growth is expected to rise to 8\u00c2\u00be percent in 2010/11 from about 7 percent in 2009/10, as robust corporate profits and easy financing conditions fuel investment. Both the NIEs and ASEAN economies are expected to grow on average by 6\u00c2? percent in 2010, as exports and private domestic demand have surged, before moderating to 4\u00c2\u00be and 5\u00c2? percent, respectively, in 2011. In Japan, growth is now expected to reach 2.4 percent in 2010'mainly thanks to stronger than expected exports in the first half of 2010'before easing to 1.8 percent in 2011 as the fiscal stimulus gradually tapers off. In Australia and New Zealand, growth is expected at about 3 percent in 2010 before accelerating to 3\u00c2? and 3\u00c2? percent, respectively, in 2011, with still robust commodity prices boosting private domestic demand. **Intensified risks** So, is it all good news for Asia? Not quite. While we have revised our baseline growth forecasts upward, we also believe that the downside risks for growth during the remainder of this year and next have intensified, especially for Asian economies that are more dependent on external demand and external financing. The greater uncertainty in our forecasts for Asia is a direct consequence of the much greater uncertainty about the underlying strength of the global recovery after the recent financial turmoil in the Euro area. Indeed, as the experience of global financial crisis has shown us all too well, turmoil in one part of the world can have far-reaching effects'even for countries that have little direct exposure to the source of the trouble. While Asia's direct financial linkages to the most vulnerable Euro area economies are limited, if the European recovery stalls and spills over to global growth, that may well affect Asia through both trade and financial channels. Many Asian economies (especially the NIEs and ASEAN) are highly dependent on external demand'and their export exposure to Europe is at least as large as that to the United States. However, economies with a larger domestic demand base, such as China, India and Indonesia'what I sometimes refer to as the 'growth leaders'\u009d'are relatively less vulnerable to a new external demand shock. Contagion from a Europe-wide credit event also could materialize through bank funding and corporate financing, especially in those regional economies more dependent on foreign currency financing. Further spikes in global risk aversion could also precipitate capital outflows from the region and weaken equity valuations, undermining the positive feedback loop between favorable financial conditions and domestic demand. On the positive side, Asia still has policy room to maneuver if such contagion were to occur. First, Asian central banks could swiftly redeploy tested instruments to overcome market disruptions, as shown by the reestablishment of the U.S. dollar liquidity swap facility announced by the Bank of Japan in May 2010. Second, the planned withdrawal of monetary and fiscal stimulus could be delayed in order to mitigate adverse spillovers to the real economy.

[Asia's leadership of the global recovery is undeniable, as I have said in [earlier blogs. And the extensive reforms and improved macroeconomic policy frameworks that underpinned the region's remarkable resilience to the global crisis will see Asia's successes continue. In just two short decades, we expect it to become the [largest economic region in the world. The [Korea conference will be an opportunity to showcase Asia's economic successes, and also highlight the importance of regional integration and cooperation, which has been growing rapidly in Asia. **A shared vision for Asia's future** Underpinning all the [conference sessions is a recognition of Asia's role as an important global economic actor and its growing role in international policymaking. But each session will delve deeper into aspects of how Asian and international policymakers alike can benefit from Asia's experiences. In Daejeon, Asia-Pacific economic policymakers, private sector leaders, prominent academics, and experts from regional and international institutions will bring their unique and extensive experiences together to examine these issues. Discussions are expected to be wide-ranging. The first plenary session'_The Global Economic Crisis: Asia's Resilience, Lessons, and the Challenges Ahead_'will help frame these discussions. Here, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be joined, among others, by Dong-Soo Chin (Chairman of Korea's Financial Services Commission) and Y.V. Reddy (former Reserve Bank of India Governor). They will reflect on the role of reforms and strong policy frameworks in ensuring Asia's resilience, and look forward to find new drivers of growth that can help sustain Asia's performance and rebalance the global economy. Asian countries' successes in reforming their financial systems will feature prominently in the session on _Financial Sector Issues and Global Financial Safety Net_. Panelists including Changyong Rhee (Secretary General of the Presidential Committee for the G-20 Summit) and Amando M. Tetangco Jr. (Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) will also explore the need to improve global financial safety nets, drawing on the experience of Asia's regional financial safety nets. Another key theme will be how to sustain rapid and inclusive economic growth in Asia. IMF Special Advisor Min Zhu will open the session on _Transforming Asia's Low Income Countries into Tomorrow's Emerging Markets_, which will examine Asia's growth model and how Asia's low-income countries can improve their growth prospects, drawing on the experiences of today's emerging markets. It is important for Asia and the global community, including the Fund, to work constructively and collaboratively as Asia grows, and to recognize that Asia's rapid transformation over the next generation will have implications that extend well beyond the region itself. The session _Growing Asian Integration and Global Governance_'moderated by Yanqing Yang, Managing Editor of the China Business Network'will touch on these issues, as well as on the importance of improving Asia's representation in line with its growing economic power. Personally, I am looking forward to the session, in which I am participating, on _Asia and the IMF_. I will be joined by esteemed panelists, such as Professor Yung Chul Park (Korea University), Professor David Li Daokui (Tsinghua University), and Professor Eisuke Sakakibara (Aoyama Gakuin University). **The IMF and Asia: the importance of working together** I think it is particularly important for the Fund to listen to Asian leaders'both in the public and private sectors'and engage in a close discussion on the future of Asia, its prospects and challenges, and the implications of its transformation for the rest of the world. The conference provides an opportunity for the Fund to reflect on these views, and communicate more broadly how we can strengthen our dialogue with the region and work as a partner with Asia in realizing Asia's own vision for the future. Indeed, a key challenge is to improve the understanding in Asia of the broadening range of the Fund's work, including our growing emphasis on multilateral and regional surveillance, cross-border linkages and spillovers, financial interconnectedness, and analysis of vulnerabilities, such as our Early Warning Exercise. These efforts complement our technical assistance and program engagement, where too our access and flexibility has greatly changed and expanded. We must ensure that Asia-Fund engagement is a two-way partnership, where the Fund benefits from the insights we get from policymakers, academics and other experts in Asia, and in turn the Fund is able to contribute to Asian policymaking by providing a global perspective. In order to do this well, we need to continue building our presence in Asia, reach out much more across our stakeholders, and have an active engagement in the region. The conference is thus a big step for us and we very much look forward to the discussion.

Blanchard **The macroeconomic forecasts in the IMF's latest [_World Economic Outlook_ update reflect two opposing forces.** Looking back, say over the first half of the year, numbers about economic activity have come in strong, indeed somewhat stronger than we had forecast. These would give reasons to be more optimistic than we were earlier. Looking forward, however, strong clouds have appeared on the horizon. They present real dangers and serious policy challenges, and give reasons to be less optimistic than we were earlier. Assessing the balance of these two forces is a difficult exercise. Our forecast for world growth in 2010 is about 4\u00c2? %, a bit higher than our April forecast of around 4\u00c2? %. This revision largely reflects the stronger activity during the first half of the year. Our forecast for 2011 is broadly unchanged, at about 4\u00c2? %. As always, these world growth rates hide a large difference between and within advanced and emerging and developing economies. Our growth forecast for advanced countries is 2.6% for 2010 and 2.4% for 2011. These low growth rates imply that high unemployment will remain a central issue for some time to come. Our growth forecast for emerging and developing economies is much higher, 6.8% in 2010 and 6.4% in 2011, an upward revision of 0.5% for 2010 and a small downward revision of 0.1% for 2011. Let me develop these two themes, a continuing recovery, but clouds on the horizon. The world economy expanded at an annualized rate of over 5 % in the first quarter of 2010. Growth was stronger than expected in most countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, Brazil, and India. And, in most cases, it has reflected stronger private demand, which is a good sign for the future. The most recent indicators suggest some slowdown of demand, but it is too early to assess how significant this slowdown may be. The clouds started building over** Greece**, but quickly extended to Europe, and threaten to cover the entire global economy. Worries about fiscal solvency in Greece turned into worries about fiscal solvency elsewhere. Worries about fiscal solvency have triggered worries about the solvency of banks. These in turn have led to financial turbulence, disruptions in market financing and a freeze in the interbank market in Europe. Our baseline forecasts are constructed under the assumption that policy responses will be adequate, and will limit the effects on the real economy. Even in this case ,however, they are likely to have four main macroeconomic implications. The first, which we have already observed, is a **depreciation of the Euro**. The second is a **tightening of bank lending**, especially, but perhaps not only in Europe. The third is the **need for fiscal consolidation**, which, even if well executed, is likely to affect demand and growth adversely in the short run. The fourth is a **near-term reallocation of capital flows**. For the rest of these remarks, let me focus on the last two implications, fiscal consolidation, and capital flows. The current policy focus in advanced countries is to put in place fiscal consolidation plans. While fiscal stimulus was necessary to stem a potentially catastrophic collapse of output in 2008 and 2009, countries must return to a sustainable fiscal path. The question is when, and at what speed. We believe that the key here is to put in place a credible roadmap'\u009dto stabilize the ratio of debt to GDP over the medium term, with the goal of decreasing it substantially over the longer term. In fact, at the recent G-20 Summit in Toronto, advanced economies committed to fiscal plans that will stabilize or reduce government debt to GDP ratios by 2016, which is in line with our recommendations. We believe that credibility can be achieved in two ways: First by passing reforms which improve the medium and long term outlook, such as increases in the retirement age in line with higher life expectancy. Second, by putting in place fiscal rules, such as limits on the growth of spending over time. The adjustment should start soon, but too much front-loading, too sharp a cut in deficits this year or next year, would be counterproductive. The recovery in advanced economies is still fragile, and monetary policy (already very accommodative) cannot yet be used to significantly offset the adverse short run effects of fiscal consolidation. Current plans for 2011, which imply an average decrease in the cyclically adjusted deficit in advanced G-20 countries, of about 1.25% strike us as roughly appropriate. However, what is still missing in many countries are ambitious reform to entitlement systems and, in many cases, better fiscal rules. Let me finally turn to capital flows. Before problems in Europe came to the fore, capital flows to emerging market countries were steadily increasing. Events in Europe have led to a partial reversal. While fiscal worries in advanced countries have made emerging market countries relatively more appealing, higher risk aversion on the part of investors has led them to repatriate funds, leading to a decrease in capital flows to emerging markets. We expect this reversal to be temporary, and we see the trend as one of continuing strong capital flows to emerging market countries. These inflows present emerging market countries with a difficult challenge, namely how to best deal with them. Two considerations are important here. The first is that these flows are largely driven by good fundamentals, and likely to be long lasting: limiting their overall size through controls, or fighting their effect on the exchange rate through reserve accumulation, may prove difficult and eventually self defeating. The second is that many emerging market countries would benefit from a shift from external to internal demand. This would allow them to maintain growth in the face of lower exports to advanced countries, and to better satisfy domestic needs. To achieve this requires both structural reforms and exchange rate appreciations. In this respect, the decisions by China to boost internal demand and allow for more flexibility of the yuan are welcome. To summarize, while we remain cautiously optimistic about the pace of recovery, there are clear dangers and policy challenges ahead. How Europe deals with fiscal and financial problems, how advanced countries proceed with fiscal consolidation, and how emerging countries rebalance their economies, will determine the outcome.

I also met privately with some key union leaders.** For me, three main points emerged. First, I was confirmed in my belief that, for the IMF, our interaction with the labor movement is extremely valuable. We make it a point to meet with unions, including in the context of our lending programs. Over the past few years, I have personally met international trade union leaders four times'on the eve of important G-20 meetings'as well as with individual union leaders. So the labor movement has a lot of influence on the way we work'even if they do not always think so. As an example of how the labor movement has influenced our thinking, I mentioned in Vancouver our strong support for the fiscal stimulus back in 2008, especially geared toward measures that would create jobs. We also talked about the IMF's more recent approach to country lending programs'which has changed in a number of important ways. For a start, we understand the importance of setting realistic targets for reducing deficits. A target that demands too much too soon can damage the economy; it can also damage prospects for success. In our recent lending programs too, we have been pushing for what I call 'social conditionality'\u009d'specific measures to protect the most vulnerable from the tough medicine that is often needed. It is also important to share the burden of adjustment equitably'as a country has a far better chance of pulling through a crisis if there is a sense of fairness in the program and a spirit of national solidarity. The second message that came out in Vancouver was that the labor movement has a major role to play in supporting continued economic cooperation across the world. Collaboration is really the great legacy of this crisis, as countries came together to face common problems with common solutions. Because of it, we avoided a second Great Depression. Now more than ever, the world needs a renewed unity of purpose. The labor movement needs to keep pressing this point'as do we at the IMF. What does cooperation mean in concrete terms? Well, in the [IMF's analysis for G-20 leaders in Toronto, we showed that with even greater policy cooperation, world growth could be boosted by 2\u00c2? percentage points over five years'creating 30 million new jobs. To get there, all countries need to do their bit. Fiscal consolidation in advanced countries is unavoidable. They need to put credible fiscal adjustment plans in place now, mostly starting in 2011, as the recovery is still fragile. At the same time, economies with surpluses need to boost internal demand, by spending on social safety nets, improving infrastructure, and allowing exchange rate flexibility. Fundamentally, growth is the answer'for jobs, for debt sustainability. That means unlocking productivity potential, innovating in areas like 'green technology'\u009d, and making sure that all who want jobs can find jobs. [Financial sector reform is also crucial'and on this issue too, I believe we are on the same page as the labor movement. Excessive risk-taking'often fueled by greed'threatened the entire world economy and pushed millions into unemployment and poverty. We need to put the financial sector back in the service of the productive economy. This is why we support tougher and better regulation, especially to build capital firewalls against future crises. We also think that financial sector taxation can help reduce the likelihood and cost of future crises. Here, we have some differences with the ITUC'they support a financial transactions tax while we prefer a tax on profits and remuneration. But while we may differ on the means, we are united by the common goal of ensuring a [fair and substantial contribution from the financial sector. In fact, I believe the IMF and the labor movement share a number of important goals'and this was my third take-away in Vancouver. The goal of the IMF is global macroeconomic and financial stability. This is ultimately the best guarantee of steady employment growth and job security. But it's more than that. The IMF was founded after the Second World War, and our founders were determined never again to repeat the mistakes of the past'an economic nationalism that led to devastating war. Today, our overarching goal is bringing about better relations between countries, avoiding the economic roots of instability, social unrest, and conflict. So while the IMF and the labor movement might have different views on different topics, our goals are ultimately the same'standing against narrow domestic interests, against nationalism, against war. And standing _for_ better living standards for all, and _for_ peace.

Pressure is building from the financial industry to slow reform and concerns about fiscal conditions risk drawing public and political energies away from the need to act on financial sector problems.** Fortunately, the [Group of Twenty (G-20) reaffirmed its commitment at a [summit in Toronto on June 26-27 to a comprehensive reform agenda'and we must seize the moment. We face five challenges: First, we have to address both **the micro-prudential and macro-prudential dimensions of financial reform**. The micro-prudential framework'aimed at making individual financial institutions healthier'has to be set right. The [Basel Committee is working on strengthening the bank capital and liquidity framework for this purpose and we cannot let these efforts be diluted by political pressures. Visible progress needs to be made by the time of the November G-20 summit in Seoul. At the same time, a framework of macro-prudential regulation has to be created to deal with systemic risks that reflect interconnectedness and cyclicality. Its successful implementation, however, will depend critically on addressing the flaws in the micro-prudential framework. This important work is only just beginning and must be intensified. Second, we must **look beyond banks to nonbank financial institutions**. Reforms need to make the entire financial system'not only the banks'safer. The reform agenda has so far focused on banks; in the area of nonbanks and the shadow banking system, the risk lies in not acting soon enough. Regulators, policy makers, and standard setters must speed up their work on markets and products, and nonbank financial actors. Third, we must **strike the right balance among three competing objectives'safety, efficiency, and regulatory certainty**. We have to move ahead and finalize the core rules governing capital and liquidity. This is essential not just for making the financial system safer but also for providing more certainty to the market. At the same time, the actual calibration of the required levels of capital and liquidity must proceed cautiously to ensure that, before they are finalized, the impact of the various changes, both individually and collectively, on the financial system and the overall economy have been assessed. Getting the calibration of the steady state impact right will prevent ending up with a system that is either inherently unstable, or that imposes an excessive burden on the financial sector, and ultimately on the economy. Fourth, **regulations must be both nationally appropriate and internationally consistent**. There is a danger that the regulatory framework emerging from current discussions will not be adopted evenly. Some countries that were less affected by the crisis may not see the need for implementing some of the new reforms. In a financially globalized world, however, uneven regulations across borders will inevitably lead to a migration of risky activities to those countries with the easiest requirements. This would put their financial systems at risk and, in turn, endanger the global financial system. Last but not least, **in addition to regulation, we must reform supervision**. A rule is only of value if implemented correctly. The quality of implementation in turn depends on strong supervision. Unfortunately, supervision has come up short in this crisis. There are many examples where supervisors did not take effective and timely action. Supervisors need both the ability'powers, mandate, appropriate skills, and resources'to act and the will to act. I have [written a separate blog on this. In the lead up to the crisis, many supervisors lacked either an understanding of the risks being assumed by financial institutions and/or the will to challenge institutions. They were too deferential to industry, unwilling to interfere, and not sufficiently objective and skeptical about the industry's ability to manage its own risks. We must learn from this experience. Given the task before them, supervisors require the support of the broader community of policymakers, government, and the public. There must be political support and a public expectation that supervisors will take decisions independently. These decisions will not always be popular. The supervisor's job is precisely to take away the proverbial punch bowl just as the party is getting started, and to require more conservative underwriting of loans to a sector when it is becoming 'frothy.'\u009d We must be in agreement on this. If expectations and consensus do not exist, supervisors may not have the necessary moral, political or legal support to do what is required: to be rigorous and thorough, to be skeptical, to follow through with unpopular judgments and actions. We have to work together to build the support among governments and the public for a commitment to strong supervision. This is something that must come out of this crisis. The IMF has intensified its focus on the quality of supervision in its regular financial sector surveillance and will work with the [Financial Stability Board (FSB) and others to develop specific recommendations to strengthen oversight and supervision. The G-20 has declared enhanced supervision to be the second pillar of financial reform; their support and focus on supervision will give an important emphasis to this work. The financial crisis has exposed the need for reform of the financial sector. Under the leadership of the FSB, the IMF, the World Bank, and the standard setters, FSB member countries have embarked on an ambitious agenda to reduce the likelihood and costs of future financial crises. We must stay focused on this important goal and not allow the challenges before us to overwhelm us.

It may also be key, at least in some countries, to avoiding disorderly financial market conditions, which would have a more immediate impact on growth, through effects on confidence and lending. But too much adjustment could also hamper growth, and this is not a trivial risk. How should fiscal strategies be designed to make them consistent with both short-term and long-term growth requirements? We offer ten commandments to make this possible. Put simply, what advanced countries need is clarity of intent, an appropriate calibration of fiscal targets, and adequate structural reforms. With a little help from monetary policy, and from their (emerging market) friends. **Commandment I: _You shall have a credible medium-term fiscal plan with a visible anchor (in terms of either an average pace of adjustment, or of a fiscal target to be achieved within four'five years). _** There is no simple one-size-fits-all rule. Our current macroeconomic projections imply that an average improvement in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance of some 1 percentage point per year during the next four**'**five years would be consistent with gradually closing the output gap, given current expectations on private sector demand, and would stabilize the average debt ratio by the middle of this decade. Countries with higher deficits/debt should do more, others should do less. Such a pace of adjustment must be backed-up by fairly specific spending and revenue projections, and supported by structural reforms (see below). **Commandment II: _You shall not front-load your fiscal adjustment, unless financing needs require it. _** For a few countries, frontloading may be needed to maintain access to markets and finance the deficit at reasonable rates'but, in general, a steady pace of adjustment is more important than front-loading, which could undermine the recovery and be reversed. Nonetheless, a non-trivial first installment is needed: promises of future action will not be enough. Current fiscal consolidation plans in advanced G-20 countries imply on average a reduction in the cyclically adjusted deficit of some 1\u00c2? percentage point of GDP in 2011, with significant dispersion around this according to country circumstances. This seems broadly adequate, and consistent with commandment I, at least based on current projections on the recovery of aggregate demand. This said, while front-loading fiscal tightening is, in general, inappropriate, front-loading the approval of policy measures (which would become effective at a later date) will enhance the credibility of the adjustment. **Commandment III: _You shall target a long-term decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, not just its stabilization at post-crisis levels. _** High public debt tends to raise interest rates, lower potential growth, and impede fiscal flexibility. Since the early 1970s, public debt in most advanced countries has been the ultimate absorber of negative shocks, going up in bad times, not coming down in good times. In the G-7 average, gross debt was 82 percent of GDP in 2007, a level never reached before without a major war. The current fiscal doldrums are due not only to the crisis, but also to how fiscal policy was mismanaged during the good times. This time, it must be different: the final goal must be to lower public debt ratios, gradually but steadily. **Commandment IV: _You shall focus on fiscal consolidation tools that are conducive to strong potential growth. _** This will require a bias towards (current) spending cuts, as spending ratios are high in advanced countries and require highly distortionary tax levels. Some cuts should be no brainers: for example, shifting from universal to targeted social transfers would involve significant savings, while protecting the poor. Containing public sector wages'which have risen faster than GDP in several advanced countries in the last decade'will be necessary. This said, nothing should be ruled out. Countries with low revenue ratios and large adjustment needs'like the United States and Japan'will also have to act on the revenue side. Promising 'no new taxes,'\u009d in all countries and circumstances, is unrealistic. **Commandment V: _You shall pass early pension and health care reforms as current trends are unsustainable. _** Increases in pension and health care spending represented over 80 percent of the increase in primary public spending to GDP ratio observed in the G-7 countries in the last decades. The net present value of future increases in health care and pension spending is more than ten times larger than the increase in public debt due to the crisis. Any fiscal consolidation strategy must involve reforms in both these areas. This includes Europe, where official projections largely underestimate health care spending trends. Given the magnitude of the spending increases involved, early action in these areas will be much more conducive to increased credibility than fiscal front-loading. And will not risk undermining the recovery. Indeed, some measures in this area'while politically difficult'could have positive effects on both demand and supply (for example, committing to an increase in the retirement age over time). **Commandment VI: _You shall be fair. To be sustainable over time, the fiscal adjustment should be equitable. _** Equity has various dimensions, including maintaining an adequate social safety net and the provision of public services that allow a level playing field, regardless of conditions at birth. Fighting tax evasion is also a critical component to equity. For VAT, a tax that is relatively resilient to fraud, tax evasion averages about 15 percent of revenues in G-20 advanced countries. Evasion for other taxes is likely to be higher. **Commandment VII: _You shall implement wide reforms to boost potential growth. _** Strong growth has a staggering effect on public debt: a one percentage point increase in potential growth'assuming a tax ratio of 40 percent'lowers the debt ratio by 10 percentage points within 5 years and by 30 percentage points within 10 years, if the resulting higher revenues are saved. An acceleration of labor, product and financial market reforms will thus be critical. In the current context of weak aggregate demand, reforms that increase investment are more desirable than reforms that increase saving. While both have positive long-run effects, investment friendly reforms increase demand and output in the short run, while saving friendly reforms do the opposite. A word of caution, though: the timing and magnitude of the effects of structural reforms on growth are uncertain: fiscal adjustment plans relying on faster growth would not be credible. **Commandment VIII: _You shall strengthen your fiscal institutions. _** Sustaining fiscal adjustment over time requires appropriate fiscal institutions. The current ones allowed a record public debt accumulation before the crisis. They are insufficient. This requires better fiscal rules, including in Europe; better budgetary processes, including in the United States, where, at least for Congress, the budget is essentially a one-year-at- a-time exercise; and better fiscal monitoring, including through independent fiscal agencies of the type recently created in the United Kingdom. **Commandment IX: _You shall properly coordinate monetary and fiscal policy. _** If fiscal policy is tightened, interest rates should not be raised as rapidly as in other phases of economic recovery. Calls for an early monetary policy tightening in advanced economies are misplaced. **Commandment X: _You shall coordinate your policies with other countries._** In a number of advanced countries, the reduction in budget deficits must come with a reduction in current account deficits. Put another way, if the recovery is to be maintained, the initial adverse effects of fiscal consolidation on internal demand have to be offset by stronger external demand. But this implies that the opposite happens in the rest of the world. In a number of emerging market economies, current account surpluses must be reduced, and these countries must shift from external to internal demand. The recent decisions taken by China are, in this respect, an important and welcome step. Policy coordination will also be important in some structural areas: for example, over the medium term, it will be critical to protect fiscal revenues from rising tax competition. Obey these commandments, and chances are high that you will achieve fiscal consolidation and sustained growth.

The credit slowdown is weighing on [economic activity and having policymakers seek ways to restore it, thereby laying the foundation for a resumption in high and sustainable economic growth. **How did we get there?** Understanding the reasons behind the credit slowdown is important for getting the policy response right. In the Caucasus and Central Asia, three were dominant.**** First, balance of payments pressures led to **depreciation** in several countries. With high levels of dollarization and exposure to currency risk, the depreciation contributed to a significant weakening of balance sheets of banks and unhedged borrowers. Most countries experienced reductions in their capital/asset ratios by more than 2 percentage points and increases in their nonperforming loans ratios by more than 4 percentage points. Kazakhstan and Tajikistan were particularly hard hit: the nonperforming loans ratio increased by 14'16 percentage points. Second, the crisis subjected banks to a **sharp reduction in funding**'deposits, remittances, and external borrowing'which had fueled rapid and above-trend credit growth in previous years. And third, the slowdown in economic activity may have resulted in a **tightening of credit supply** as well as a contraction in demand for credit due to heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. With impaired balance sheets, lackluster funding growth, and heightened uncertainty, credit to the economy has slumped'since end-2007, real credit growth has fallen by about 63 percentage points on average. **What can policymakers do?** Policies should aid banks in the process of repairing their balance sheets by recognizing losses and supplementing bank capital if needed. Where banks are fundamentally healthy and mainly affected by a lack of funding, temporary government or central bank liquidity injections may help restore credit growth. Of course, adequate fiscal room is a precondition for such actions. Over the medium term, macroeconomic and macroprudential policies should promote dedollarization to reduce vulnerabilities to sudden exchange rate movements and currency risk; high levels of dollarization of 40 to 80 percent were a key transmission channel of the global crisis to the region. Precrisis trends in Caucasus and Central Asia countries, as well as the international experience, have shown that macroeconomic stability is the most successful conduit for sustained dedollarization. In addition, the regulatory framework should encourage a proper pricing of currency risk, for example, by requiring higher capital charges for foreign exchange loans to unhedged borrowers, thus addressing indirect currency risk. In some countries, allowing greater exchange rate flexibility may also help banks and the corporate and household sectors to better internalize the risks of dollarization. Developing local debt markets can contribute to dedollarization by giving domestic agents access to a wider range of domestic-currency financial instruments. Moreover, local debt markets allow banks to diversify their funding base and thus become less vulnerable to swings in individual funding sources. What else might policymakers in the Caucasus and Central Asia do to revive credit? What lessons can be learned from other countries' experience? We'd like to hear from you.

On the list of thankless jobs they rank somewhere between traffic wardens and tax administrators. And yet, as the global financial crisis taught us, supervision is incredibly important. Countries with the same set of rules had very different experiences during the crisis. Why? There are clearly many reasons but one of them is 'better supervision.'\u009d After all, rules are only as good as their implementation. In some countries, the financial supervisor became the unsung hero of the crisis. One might say 'It's hip to be square!'\u009d When you think about it, the role of the financial supervisor is pretty unique. They are there during the birth, life, and death of the institutions they supervise. They license them, monitor them, lay out the rules, guide them, penalize them, and step in when they fail. The supervisor acts as a midwife, parent, mentor, cop, judge, and undertaker'all rolled into one. These are hefty responsibilities. And unfortunately, supervision often comes up short. In an assessment of standards across countries since 2000, we found that while most countries have adequate legislation, regulation, and supervisory guidance, a significant chunk do not do as well when it comes to the actual nuts and bolts of supervision. **Five key factors** So what makes a good supervisor? A recent [IMF Staff Position Note identifies five factors'intrusive, proactive, comprehensive, adaptive, and conclusive. **Intrusive** means having an intimate knowledge of the supervised entity'in short, stick your nose in, and know what's going on. To be **proactive**, a supervisor must first be skeptical. She must always question, even in good times, the industry's direction or actions, not worrying about being the party-pooper. Supervision is most valuable when least valued. Good supervision is also **comprehensive**'that means leaving no stone unturned, and being especially vigilant about what's going on the edge of the regulatory perimeter. To be **adaptive**, supervisors must keep their eyes on the ever-moving ball, keeping abreast of new products, new markets, new services, and new risks. And finally, supervision must be **conclusive**'don't just identify problems, follow up too. **Learning to say No** How do we develop a good system of supervision? How do we learn to say 'no'\u009d? There are really two pillars'the ability to act and the will to act. The ability to act depends on proper legal authority, adequate resources, a clear and well-defined strategy, a robust internal organization, and an effective working relationship with other agencies. Once all that is in place, we still need a willingness to fulfill the role of supervisor. This is often the hard part, and involves standing up to the 'cool kids'\u009d and the vested interests. A number of factors can help here, including a clear and unambiguous mandate, operational independence that is free from political or industry interference, accountability, a skilled staff, a healthy arms-length relationship with the industry, and an effective partnership with boards of directors. Supervisors are the people who don't get swayed by collective euphoria. They are the people who are not afraid to say no. In short, supervisors are cool. And they need all the support they can get'including from politicians.

Slow credit growth may therefore be constraining the strength of the recovery in the short run, in addition to limiting prospects for longer-term growth. Policymakers are understandably concerned. **How did we get here?** To understand the slowdown, one must first recognize that precrisis credit growth in MENA countries was very high, perhaps unsustainably so in some cases. Evidence indicates that several MENA countries (Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and perhaps Iran) experienced a credit boom prior to the crisis, in the sense that credit not only surpassed its historical trend, but did so by a sufficiently large amount. Worldwide studies of similar credit boom episodes have shown that, if large enough, of long enough duration, and accompanied by other signs of macroeconomic overheating, they tend to result in severe distress to their banking systems. Even in the absence of a full-blown credit boom, above-trend growth in credit'as observed in most MENA banking systems prior to the crisis'often exerts strains on bank balance sheets. **What caused the slowdown?** The most immediate cause for the credit slowdown in some countries has been precisely the emergence of these balance-sheet strains, built up during the credit expansion and exacerbated by the economic downturn. Bank profitability declined, nonperforming loans mounted, and capital losses ensued in many cases, all of which weakened the ability of banks to continue lending at the same pace. A second cause was the loss of bank funding. Deposit growth, as well as banks' ability to tap international markets for funding, declined notably in most countries, considerably limiting the funds available for lending. However, in many countries these funding constraints were offset to some degree by countercyclical policy, whereby central banks and governments injected liquidity, capital, or even deposits into the banks. A third cause of the slowdown, also on the supply side, has been an observed reluctance of banks to lend, perhaps exhibiting greater risk aversion in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic and regulatory environment. In addition, it has also been argued that, as a result of home-grown financial difficulties stemming from the failure of two family-based conglomerates in Saudi Arabia, investment companies in Kuwait, and the Dubai World crisis, the credit culture in MENA countries may be undergoing a transformation'away from name-lending and toward a more arm's-length approach. A fourth cause of the slowdown has been a noticeable decline in the demand for credit, also a product of the economic downturn as well as a greater degree of uncertainty. It is likely that borrowers are more risk averse, as their long- held assumptions on the viability of certain projects and sectors'witness the Dubai real estate market's severe correction over the past two years as a prominent example'are being tested. **How can policy help?** A preliminary note of caution is warranted. Credit booms tend to result in a phase of protracted sluggishness in credit, often lasting several years. Therefore, one should not reasonably expect a rapid recovery in credit, regardless of policy responses. That said, there are several areas in which policy can have an impact, promoting credit growth and thus shortening the slowdown phase. First, in banking systems where financial strains have been greatest, cleanup of balance sheets should proceed quickly'recognizing loan losses and injecting additional capital if needed'as a precondition for lending to resume. Second, funding and capital support'effective in partially offsetting banks' loss of funding'should continue, provided that other objectives, such as preventing a re-emergence of inflation, are not jeopardized. Third, transparency and communication on monetary and regulatory policy should be enhanced to temper risk aversion that may be causing credit to lag. Also, to the extent that banks are migrating to a business model that relies less on personal connections, policy should promote greater corporate governance and disclosure. Finally, in the longer run, efforts should be taken to reduce the economy's dependence on bank financing by developing domestic bond markets, thereby providing viable alternatives to bank credit. Have policymakers exhausted all avenues for reviving credit? Are there other policy objectives that might conflict with that of encouraging credit growth?

Foreign capital has poured in, attracted by Asia's strong fundamentals and bright growth prospects. Portfolio and cross border banking flows have rebounded sharply as financial conditions normalized. Looking ahead, our growth projections suggest that Asia is expected to outperform advanced countries. As a result, the region is likely to continue to attract significant capital inflows, assuming that fallout from the euro zone sovereign debt crisis is contained and that the recent spike in global risk aversion abates. So is there a downside risk to this deluge of foreign capital? History has shown that persistent and large capital inflows can be a double edged sword. While they bring with them numerous benefits, they do pose risks and policy dilemmas. Continued large capital flows pose, for example, the risk of overheating and runups in asset prices that may subsequently render the region vulnerable to outflows and asset price busts. **Asset prices** So far, while capital flows have boosted asset prices, we find the runup in such prices to be generally contained. Indeed, it appears that stock prices are not out of line with historical norms in most countries, based on using price-to-earnings ratios as a measure of valuation. But there is a concern that equity analysts may be overly optimistic regarding future earnings growth. Turning to property markets, there are lingering concerns that property prices have been rising too fast, especially in China and Hong Kong SAR. But these trends have been seen in localized pockets in specific countries, and don't appear to be a nationwide phenomenon. However, there is a need to remain vigilant to the buildup of bubbles, as they take time to develop. Analysis in our _[Regional Economic Outlook__ _finds that it can take 11 quarters for a stock price bubble to develop and burst and even longer for a property price bubble. Furthermore, inflationary pressures have emerged in some countries, and inflation expectations have increased. Also it is worrying that excess liquidity has been rising across Asia, in part fueled by the strong inflows and resistance in many countries to letting exchange rates appreciate. **Prudential measures** Policymakers in the region have already stepped in, appropriately in my view, to put in place prudential measures to slow the runup in asset prices, particularly in the property market. These measures are already beginning to work. Policymakers also have at their disposal other tools, including allowing more exchange rate flexibility to slow down capital inflows. While the recent inflows pose short-term macro management challenges, over the medium term capital inflows to the region could help to boost much needed infrastructure development and develop service sectors. Along with reforms aimed at improving the investment climate'such as increasing product and labor market competition, leveling the playing field for foreign investors, ensuring contract enforcement, and reducing administrative bottlenecks'they could help to increase foreign and domestic investment in key sectors. In this way, they could also support the package of policies that is needed in many Asian countries to rebalance the economy toward domestic demand in order to maintain medium-term growth momentum.

India is of course, along with China and some other countries, an important driver of the Asian recovery. And Asia in turn is [leading the global recovery. At the same time, the global recovery also influences Asia's growth, given Asia's high dependence on export demand and its growing integration with international financial markets. And the global outlook is subject to downside risks, which came to the forefront again last week in the form of [developments in Europe and continue to be reflected in financial market volatility all across the world. So, while recent Asian performance has been strong and the outlook remains relatively positive, we are not yet out of the woods. ### Getting the pace right Against this uncertain background, the main near-term challenge for Asian policymakers is to judge the appropriate pace for normalizing monetary and fiscal policy conditions. With Asia recovering ahead of and faster than advanced economies, policy conditions in the region will need to start normalizing sooner than in several other parts of the world. But the fragility of the global recovery means that the withdrawal of stimulus will have to be cautious and gradual. One fortunate consideration in this regard is that thanks to the strengthening of policy frameworks across the region in recent years, most Asian economies have some fiscal and monetary 'space'\u009d to respond flexibly to external shocks. The right pace of 'exit'\u009d is different for different economies, as it depends in each on the stage of the cycle and exposure to various risks. The pace of monetary normalization will need to be guided by a few key considerations, such as the degree of monetary accommodation that is still in place, the pace at which output gaps are closing, and the emergence of inflationary pressures. In economies with less economic slack and smaller exposure to external demand, the pace of normalization can proceed faster than in economies that are operating far from capacity constraints or are highly exposed to uncertain external demand. The pick-up in consumer price inflation in a few economies, including India, in recent quarters also bears watching. Part of the pick-up has owed to food and energy prices, but a part also owes to rising 'core'\u009d prices, indicating a spread of inflationary pressure beyond the volatile food and energy components. ### Complications Now monetary tightening of course carries with it the risk of attracting further capital inflows that could complicate macroeconomic management. Countries could consider several measures to deal with large inflows, as many in the region are already doing. Such measures could include prudential regulations to address unduly rapid rises in asset prices, such as equity and property prices, and greater exchange rate flexibility. On fiscal policy, many Asian economies are planning to withdraw this year part of the stimulus that they put in place during the crisis. Still, I expect fiscal conditions to remain accommodative in most of Asia. Such a gradual removal of fiscal stimulus seems to me to be entirely appropriate, given the low levels of public debt in most of the region (Japan being an exception). Also, given the still large downside risks to the outlook, it is good risk management to keep in place some targeted fiscal measures to support growth. It is nonetheless still important for policymakers to look beyond the short term, and to have in place plans to move to a more neutral stance over the medium term in order to safeguard their fiscal space to deal with future shocks and to maintain policy credibility and effectiveness.

But it also comes with a number of potential risks that need to be managed. Our new _[Regional Economic Outlook for the Western Hemisphere_ takes an in-depth look at the risks arising from what we call '_easy external financial conditions_.'\u009d There we analyze how the more financially integrated economies of Latin America have responded to such conditions in the past, with comparison to countries of other regions. Our comparisons focus especially on a group of advanced economies'Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and Norway'that also are commodity exporters, as well as being inflation targeters with highly flexible exchange rates. We show that easy global financing conditions can lead to booms in domestic demand and credit, and to large current account deficits and capital inflows'an accumulation of risks that can end badly. But a boom-bust outcome is not a certain fate. Our analysis shows how economies around the world have differed in their responses to cheap foreign money, with their own policies playing a key role. In fact policies can act to mitigate'or enhance'the accumulation of risks during episodes of easy financial conditions. **What are 'easy external financial conditions'\u009d? ** Motivating our study is the fact external financial conditions fluctuate greatly over time. A simple but effective way to capture this variation is to look at two summary indicators: * Interest rates in reserve currency countries. Our study uses U.S. short-term interest rates, minus expected U.S. core inflation. * Global risk aversion. A frequently used indicator of global appetite for 'risk assets'\u009d is the VIX. This financial market indicator turns out to say a lot about the cost of borrowing for emerging market countries, as seen in its close relationship with their bond spreads (Figure 1). [ When both these factors are on the low side'as they were for a number of years in the 1990s, and again during 2004-07'we say that external financial conditions are 'easy'\u009d (Figure 2). [ Today we again see such easy conditions. The U.S. real interest rate is unusually low, and is likely to stay on the low side for some time, given the weak state of the U.S. economy. The VIX is also well below its historical average'we assume this condition will last some time also, though this is very far from certain. Note that investors' concerns over some southern European countries triggered a jump in the VIX and in emerging market bond spreads earlier this year, and again briefly in late April, before settling down. **How have economies responded to easy conditions? ** Analyzing the responses of countries of Latin America and other regions, we look at such key macro variables as domestic demand and credit, among others (while controlling for shifts in other factors, such as their terms of trade and world economic growth). Among the empirical findings is that_ domestic demand tends to be stimulated by low foreign interest rates and also by low VIX levels'but these effects have been much larger in Latin America than in the comparator group of advanced economies._ This demand response comes mainly from the private sector, but governments in Latin America, in contrast to those in the advanced economy group, tended to add on to it by increasing their own expenditure to some degree. The result has been that in Latin America domestic demand tended to grow much in excess of trend output during episodes of easy conditions (Figure 3). [ Economic policies have also differed in other ways likely to influence the response to easy money'particularly in foreign exchange policies. The advanced economies' exchange rates were highly flexible, and currency appreciation helped choke off the foreign-financed growth of domestic demand. Latin American countries now allow much more exchange rate flexibility than in the past, but in 2006-07 many joined other emerging markets in trying to limit or smooth appreciation of their currencies. At the other extreme, some economies in Eastern Europe that held to fixed exchange rates during the same years were among those with the fastest domestic demand growth, bringing large current account deficits amid soaring credit'until the good times ended. **What about capital inflows? ** Of course inflows of foreign capital are an essential part of the story, and we show how these have accelerated at times of easy external financial conditions. Focusing on the amount of capital inflows, however, could miss an important point: the volume of such inflows is not driven only by foreign investors' decisions. _In fact the amount of capital inflows an economy receives is influenced by how its private and public sectors respond to easy global conditions. _ If private spending reacts strongly to cheap foreign money, this additional spending can drive a widening current account deficit and a demand for foreign money to fund that deficit. And if central banks react to capital inflows with foreign exchange market intervention that tries to hold the exchange rate at a too-weak level'or that excessively limits the rate of currency appreciation and exchange rate volatility'then incentives for new capital inflows will probably grow rather than dissipate. **Policies can help contain risks ** In short, episodes of easy foreign money give rise to a range of risks, a situation calling for a set of policy responses. Our analysis underscores the usefulness of allowing significant flexibility of the exchange rate, maintaining fiscal discipline and using fiscal policy to lean against possible excessive demand growth, and applying macroprudential financial policies to dampen unwanted credit booms. If these approaches together turn out to be insufficient, then carefully designed taxes on capital inflows might also be of help, on a temporary basis. _For further analysis of these and related issues, including a discussion of the risks of currency appreciation for economic growth, please see Chapter 3 of the May 2010 Regional Economic Outlook for the Western Hemisphere.

China is of course an important part of Asia. And Asia is now a key driver of the global recovery. Indeed, as the world climbs out of its deepest recession in over half a century, it is Asia that is leading the recovery. While growth in the advanced world is being held back for now by unemployment and weak household and bank balance sheets, in the emerging world ' and particularly Asia ' it is rebounding strongly. In our latest _[Regional Economic Outlook_, we envisage that Asia will grow by 7 percent in 2010 and 2011, and emerging Asia by 8.7 percent each year, making significant contributions to global growth of 4.2 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, this year and next. We expect Asia to continue leading the way in the near term, buoyed by strong recoveries in China, India, and other countries. Global inventory restocking, particularly in the United States, should continue to fuel Asian production and exports late into 2010. And domestic demand in Asia has also developed a strong momentum, with consumption boosted by high asset values and consumer confidence and investment helped by rising capacity utilization. **Positive spillovers** In China, growth is already at 11.9 percent in the first quarter and we expect it to average 10 percent for 2010 as a whole. The strong recovery has reflected a combination of strong private demand and government efforts to catalyze consumption and ramp up infrastructure investment. China's strong recovery is having positive spillovers for the rest of the region, especially commodity and capital goods exporters. As China's recovery begins to take a firm hold, the government has ' rightly in my view ' started to cool down the rapid pace of credit growth in order to safeguard credit quality. Looking beyond China to Asia as a whole, there are several striking features of the region's performance at this time. For the first time in recent history, Asia is leading a global recovery, in the sense that the contribution to global growth of Asia outstrips that of other individual regions. It has done so before on a trend basis, but it is now doing so during a recovery from a global recession. In another break with past patterns, Asia's bounceback is not driven only by exports. Exports are playing a role, of course, but so now is domestic demand. I don't mean just the public stimulus, but also private demand. And, finally, capital inflows are surging. In previous episodes, capital inflows were very slow to return to Asia, but this time around they are surging, driven by high levels of liquidity in the advanced countries but also attracted by the bright growth prospects and resilient policy frameworks in Asia. **Risk of inflation** At the same time, Asia still faces several risks and policy challenges, in both the near and the medium term. If capital inflows continue on a large scale they will raise the risks of inflation, asset prices booms and busts, and macroeconomic volatility. And, in the medium term, a common challenge for many Asian countries is still to rebalance the economy away from a heavy reliance on exports by strengthening private demand. Private demand will have to be nurtured through a package of policies, including measures that several countries are already taking to strengthen and develop financial sectors and social insurance systems, that will lessen the motivation for precautionary saving. A stronger exchange rate should also be part of this package and would raise household incomes and consumption over the medium term. I will write about these and other challenges in the coming days and weeks.

Taxpayers who financed the rescue of the financial sector during the recent crisis want their money back'or at least not to get caught again. Some want to see more of the money coursing through the financial system turned to public use. The industry worries about new taxes coming on top of the swathe of regulatory reforms that likely lies ahead for them. And some governments in countries whose financial sector weathered the storm pretty well wonder why they should now ask it for cash. Responding to the request from the G-20 leaders puts us in the middle of all these concerns. Last week the IMF gave an interim report to the G-20 finance ministers focused on the specific question we were asked: what are the options in raising money from the financial sector to pay for the costs of government intervention from which it benefits. That report is confidential, but'you may have noticed'has still managed to attract a lot of attention. So let me set out how our thinking on this stands. Our aim is to take a cool look at the issues about which everyone gets so heated. The options we have come up with so far'this interim report will be revised for the June summit'won't please everyone (or, maybe, anyone), but can, we hope, help move the public debate ahead by bringing some economic and financial analysis to bear. In doing this we looked forward more than back. Revenge is not a good principle for tax design, but averting and preparing for future harm is. ### What is to be done? The challenge is to ensure that financial institutions bear the direct fiscal costs that any future failures or crises will impose'and maybe somewhat more, given all the other costs that bank failure can impose on the economy. We also need to make these events both less likely to happen and less costly when they do. We think two types of tax can play a role. **A 'Financial Stability Contribution''I come to bury Caesar, not to bail him out** One reason the crisis was such a painful mess was that many governments did not have the tools to wind down failing institutions in a quick and orderly manner. All too often their only options, both hugely unpleasant, were to either (1) let a systemic institution fail and bear the chaotic fallout or (2) pump in enough public support to keep it alive, so confirming the prior suspicion that these institutions were indeed too big to fail. Governments lacked a way to 'resolve''a new word even for many economists'large failing institutions. Resolution means equity holders would be wiped out, management replaced, and unsecured creditors take a loss'a 'haircut''on their claims. All this should be nasty enough for owners and managers to reduce any problems of 'moral hazard' (taking too much risk in the expectation that someone else will bear the costs if things turn out badly). But most countries still don't have such a mechanism. Financial stability requires creating them. So where does the idea of a contribution come in? Resolution requires upfront cash, to reduce uncertainty for creditors (and the creditors' creditors'\u00a6) by quickly giving some value to their claims. And the industry should pay for this: it is, or should be, a cost of doing business just like paying for deposit insurance, or maintaining their information systems. This is what we call a _Financial Stability Contribution_ (FSC). It would ensure that the industry does indeed pay a reasonable chunk of these resolution costs before a crisis occurs, with this amount topped up, if needed, by 'ex post' charges after disaster strikes (much as the Financial Crisis Responsibility fee proposed in the United States aims to recoup some of the costs of public support). ### Costs of the crisis Incidentally, as a first step, we tried to figure out how much the recent crisis has cost governments in terms of the direct support they provided to the financial sector. The answer is: so far, about 2.7 percent of GDP for the group of advanced G-20 countries. More for some, less for others ' including most emerging market countries. That's a sizable sum, but the risks during the crisis were even larger, with guarantees and other contingent liabilities averaging around 25 percent of GDP for the advanced G-20. And all that ignores indirect fiscal costs caused by the recession and (to a lesser extent) stimulus measures'which is causing a surge in public debt'and, perhaps most cruelly, of all, a cumulative loss of output of around 27 percent of GDP. The FSC would start as a simple levy on some balance sheet (and, possibly, off-balance sheet) variables, but then be refined to strengthen the link with each institution's contribution to systemic risk'giving them some incentive to reduce it. It would be permanent (to keep that beneficial effect at work, at least until regulatory solutions are felt to have done enough) and paid by all financial institutions (because they all benefit from the greater financial stability the resolution mechanism provides). Whether the revenue from such a charge should be treated just like other tax revenue or instead feed an earmarked fund to help with resolutions is secondary. The fiscal impact is the same (assuming of course, other policies are not affected by whether there is or not an earmarked fund): the government has to sell fewer bonds on the open market, either because it has more tax revenue or because it has a captive customer in the fund. The main argument for a fund is that it could provide more assurance that the agency in charge of resolution has ready access to the resources it needs. ### A 'Financial Activities Tax' A FAT is just a tax on the sum of the profits and remuneration paid by financial institutions. That sounds simple, and, in essence, it is. But why an extra tax on financial institutions? Here, I'm afraid, things get a bit nerdy. So brace up for what is coming. Profits plus all remuneration is value added. So a tax of this kind would be a kind of Value-Added Tax or VAT. And that could make sense because current VATs don't work well for financial services, which are largely VAT-exempt. This means that a FAT of this kind could make the tax treatment of the financial sector more like that other sectors and so help offset a tendency for the financial sector, purely for tax reasons, to be too large'or too fat. Now suppose that the base included only remuneration above some high level, and only profits above a 'normal' rate of return. Then the base of the FAT may not be a bad proxy for taxes on 'rents''return in excess of competitive levels'earned in the sector. Some might find taxing that excess fair. Or one might include only profits above some level well above normal. Taxing away some of these high returns in good times may help correct for any tendency to excessive risk-taking implied by financial institutions not attaching enough weight to outcomes in bad times (whether because of limited liability, or because they think themselves too big to fail). ### What about a financial transactions tax? ****We also looked at the idea of a general financial transactions tax (FTT)'the last few months have left us in no doubt as to the seriousness of the public support this enjoys. This would be a tax paid every time a share, bond, or other financial instrument is bought or sold, and/or whenever foreign currency is bought or sold. Our work is not yet complete'this is an interim report, remember'but, while some forms of FTT may be feasible (indeed most G-20 countries already tax some financial transactions), we don't think this is the best way of meeting the two key objectives set out above. An FTT is not focused on reducing systemic risk and it isn't effective at taxing rents in the financial sector'much of the burden may well fall on ordinary consumers. Moreover, the financial services industry is very good at devising schemes to get around such a tax and (this is also true, to be fair, of the FSC and FAT, but we suspect to a lesser extent). One way to think about the comparison is that just as a FAT is like a VAT, an FTT is like a turnover tax'and most countries have long found that the VAT is better at raising revenue: in the jargon, more efficient. All this doesn't mean we rule out an FTT in other contexts'but it is not the most effective way to address the task at hand. ### Should everyone do this? Several countries that did not need to pour large resources into their financial institutions are naturally reluctant to lumber them with more charges. At the same time, financial institutions are so adept at tax and regulatory arbitrage that those countries who do want to act fear they may be undercut by those who don't. But this tension is not as great as it may seem. If financial history teaches us anything, it is that no one should think themselves immune from failures and crisis. Moreover, if the FSC in particular is properly risk-adjusted, countries with safer systems will simply face a smaller contribution. And importantly, the last thing we want to do is to repress/bury the financial sector by imposing a heavy burden; like the food supply, it means too many good things for economic growth. ### Next What we gave to G-20 ministers was an interim report, and we will be working more on this in the light of their discussion last Friday. We will continue too to listen to what others tell us. One theme of our work that has already been widely stressed is that any tax initiatives need to be coordinated with regulatory ones'so we have some number-crunching, as well as more tough times, ahead of us. Still, we hope to contribute to the debate on what really matters in all this: how to reduce the risk, and costliness, of future financial failures. _Carlo Cottarelli is Director of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department._ ", "index": 713}, {"pub": "4/22/2010", "title": "Learning from the Crisis: Future IMF Lending Role", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1365", "content": " By [Reza Moghadam **Let's rewind the tape to October 2008. Barely a couple of weeks have passed since Lehman filed for bankruptcy, and emerging markets are selling off like crazy.** The vaunted 'decoupling'\u009d theories'hailed as visionary only a few months before'lie in tatters as investors flee in droves. With its mandate to foster global economic stability, the IMF comes under the spotlight: many observers question whether the institution has what it takes to stop contagion and help emerging markets cope with global deleveraging. With strong support from its membership, the IMF did not hesitate to come to the rescue. It provided large and upfront [financial assistance to help countries weather the crisis. It [overhauled its lending toolkit, notably by establishing the Flexible Credit Line (an instrument allowing countries with very strong policies to tap IMF resources unconditionally). And, importantly, its membership, building on the political momentum of the G-20, committed to tripling its [resource base. These actions helped put out the fire, setting emerging market spreads on a downward trajectory. [ A [new paper on rethinking the IMF's financing role (a key aspect of our broader work on modernizing the [IMF mandate) reviews the effectiveness of reformed lending and draws on the lessons of the crisis to improve IMF instruments further. **A multilayered global financial safety net ** The large shocks observed during the recent crisis have heightened countries' perception of volatility and contagion risks. [ Unsurprisingly, policymakers, market participants, and academic observers all agreed on the need to further strengthen the global financial safety net, of which IMF lending is at the core. [ But what does this mean? It requires * Increasing the resilience to shocks of countries receiving capital flows, principally through improved policies. Adequacy of reserves is also important, but the associated benefits tend to have diminishing returns (an issue I have recently [blogged on). * Avoiding excessive risk-taking through better supervision in countries generating capital flows. * Leveraging financing vehicles such as central bank swap lines, regional financing arrangements (e.g., the Chiang Mai initiative), multilateral development bank lending, and IMF financial assistance. But what is the role of these seemingly overlapping bilateral and multilateral vehicles? They complement each other in helping countries manage volatility and contagion risks. Central banks have a natural advantage in alleviating _short-term liquidity_ pressures'the swap lines in the recent crisis played an instrumental role in recycling dollar liquidity. By pooling regional reserves, regional financing arrangements can help address _idiosyncratic shocks_. Lending by multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, mainly aims at supporting_ long-term_ _growth_. The role of the IMF is mostly to provide _countercyclical lending_, and is different from that of other institutions given its global reach, preferred creditor status, large resources, and its ability to catalyze private lending through agreed policy frameworks. **Enhancing the IMF's crisis prevention and management capability ** But we can build even further on the progress made during the crisis to leverage the IMF's unique characteristics and enhance the **crisis prevention toolkit**. * The [**Flexible Credit Line**, which was used to good effect by Mexico, Colombia, and Poland during the recent crisis, could be made even _more_ effective by lengthening its duration (currently six months) and making country qualification more predictable. [ * To help ensure that the Fund offers effective crisis prevention instruments also to those well performing countries but that do not qualify for the Flexible Credit Line, one option would be to introduce a new crisis prevention instrument (the **Precautionary Credit Line**). This would provide upfront access to financing as in the Flexible Credit Line, but, differently from that instrument, would allow for some (light and focused) policy conditionality. **Management of systemic crises** is another area where improvements could be made in the IMF lending toolkit. In particular, the IMF needs to be able to proactively erect a firewall to protect innocent bystanders from the spread of virulent systemic shocks. While some central banks did play such a role during the recent crisis, there is a strong case for building on this for the future. First, given the necessarily ad hoc nature of national central bank responses there is a need for a transparent and predictable standing facility. Second, given the global reach of systemic crises, there is a need for a global, rather than a national or regional solution. Third, the nature of the next systemic crisis may be different, raising doubts on whether central banks may be called into action, One option would be to establish a **Multicountry Swap Line** (MSL) as a mechanism enabling the IMF to make a unilateral and simultaneous offer of short-term liquidity lines to a limited set of systemically important countries with strong policy track records. **What about moral hazard?** Further enhancements to the IMF lending toolkit along the lines suggested above would increase the IMF's ability to prevent crises and mitigate the cost of systemic shocks. To add credibility, the IMF resource base needs to be adequate to deal with most shocks. Some observers, however, worry that a large IMF with beefed-up financing instruments would add to moral hazard, encouraging reckless lending or unsafe policies. This is less of an issue when IMF lending is targeted to deal with 'exogenous'\u009d shocks, i.e., shocks that cannot be influenced by the behavior of the individual country or its creditors. A relevant example here is a **_systemic_** liquidity shock, affecting 'innocent bystanders'\u009d as in the MSL. But moral hazard is a more legitimate concern when dealing with **_idiosyncratic_** shocks. This is why, as a general principle, financial assistance to members with weaker track records needs to be subject to the observance of policy conditions. Conversely, instruments providing upfront financing should be dedicated exclusively to countries with stronger policy track records. In the coming months, we will do more work on these issues with the aim of distilling specific proposals on revamping the IMF lending toolkit by the fall. In the meantime, I welcome your [feedback.

Blanchard **Let me begin with some good news. The global recovery has evolved better than expected.** We at the IMF now [forecast global growth to reach 4.2% in 2010, an upward revision of 0.3% from our January forecast, and 4.3% in 2011. Alongside growth, global trade has also shown a strong rebound, and so have capital flows. And, as discussed in the newly released _[Global Financial Stability Report_, financial market conditions and stability have improved. These good global numbers hide however a more complex reality, namely a tepid recovery in many advanced economies, and a much stronger one in most emerging and developing economies. Let me discuss each group in turn. We forecast growth in advanced economies to be 2.3% for 2010 and 2.4% in 2011. This is just not enough to make up for the ground lost during the recession. Output for these countries is now 7% below its pre-crisis trend, and this 'output gap'\u009d is expected to remain large for many years to come. Associated with this prolonged output gap is persistent high [unemployment. We forecast the unemployment rate in advanced economies to reach 8.4% in 2010, and to only decline to 8.0% in 2011. The main factor behind this weak performance and this prolonged output gap is weak private demand. In the **United States**, consumers, who were the drivers of the economy before the crisis, are being more prudent. In** Europe**, where banks play a central role in financial intermediation, the weak banking sector limits credit supply. In **Japan**, deflation has reappeared, leading to higher real interest rates, and putting in danger an already weak recovery. By contrast, we forecast growth in emerging and developing economies to be much stronger, 6.3% in 2010, and 6.4% in 2011. Developing **Asia** is in the lead, with forecasts of 8.7% for 2010, and 8.6% in 2011. Growth appears not only strong but sustainable. While fiscal policy often played a central role in supporting activity in 2009, private demand is strengthening, and can sustain growth in the future. ### ### Serious new challenges The asymmetric nature of the recovery creates serious challenges, both for advanced and for developing and emerging market economies. In advanced countries, the main challenge is fiscal consolidation. A year ago, the risk was that private demand would collapse, leading to another Great Depression scenario. The priority was thus to implement fiscal stimulus programs, and avoid this catastrophic scenario. This we did. Thanks in part to the stimulus programs, demand did not collapse, and has indeed started to grow again, if only weakly. One year later however, the risk has shifted location. The loss in fiscal revenues associated with the loss in output is threatening to lead, if not contained, to a debt explosion. In most countries, fiscal consolidation must increasingly be the priority. Emerging and developing countries face a different set of challenges. One of them is large [capital inflows. Higher growth prospects and higher interest rates are attracting large capital inflows. Such inflows, especially when driven by growth prospects, are fundamentally good news, but we have learned from experience that they can also lead to booms and busts. Thus, the main policy issue facing recipient countries is how to best accommodate these flows, how much to let the currency appreciate, how to use macroeconomic policy, how to use macro-prudential tools, reserves, and capital controls, to best avoid excesses and maintain stable growth. ### Solutions closely linked Interestingly, and importantly, the solutions to the challenges facing advanced and emerging countries are closely linked: In advanced economies, fiscal consolidation is needed, but is likely to have an adverse effect on demand and thus on growth. To offset these adverse effects and maintain growth, advanced countries, as a whole, may need to depreciate their currency so as to increase their net exports. This, in turn, implies that emerging and developing countries, again as a whole, do the reverse, namely let their currency appreciate, and reduce net exports. It is in their global interest to do so, as this adjustment may be needed to sustain growth in advanced countries, and, by implication, strong growth in the rest of the world. In many countries, it is also clearly in their own, direct, interest to do so. In **China** for example, a shift away from exports towards domestic consumption--a shift that requires both structural measures to decrease saving, and an appreciation of the currency--appears highly desirable. ### New stage of the crisis To conclude, we find ourselves at an important new stage of the crisis. A global depression has been averted. The world economy is recovering, and recovering better than we had previously thought likely. This is certainly welcome news. But new--and no less formidable'challenges have presented themselves. Achieving strong, sustained and balanced growth will not be easy. It will require more work--namely fiscal consolidation in advanced countries, exchange rate adjustments, a rebalancing of demand across the world. These are the tasks facing policymakers over the next few years.

The IMF has just released its new _[Global Financial Stability Report_. We find that risks to stability have eased somewhat. The policy stimulus enacted at the height of the crisis has provided substantial support to financial institutions and markets, and has underpinned the global recovery. This has helped to improve a broad range of risk indicators and financial conditions. And yet **risks remain elevated**: global financial stability has not been secured, as the recovery is still fragile, and the repair of consumer and financial balance sheets is still ongoing. Furthermore, there are concerns over rising sovereign risks related to the buildup of public debt that need to be carefully monitored and addressed. **Challenges in the banking system** On the banking system, the news is encouraging, as improving economic and financial market conditions reduce expected writedowns. Our estimate of global writedowns for banks has improved by around $500 billion from $2.8 trillion to $2.3 trillion. Two-thirds of these estimated writedowns have been realized so far. Additionally, bank capital ratios in Europe and the United States are stronger, as banks have raised capital and enjoyed a temporary boost in earnings. However, this improvement in the aggregate picture masks pockets of weak banks with smaller capital buffers, with high risks of further asset deterioration, and that display chronically low profitability due to overcapacity in the financial system. Moreover, banks around the world now face significant funding challenges amid a wall of maturing debt, including almost 5 trillion dollars coming due in the next 3 years. __ As a result of these on-going pressures in banking systems, the recovery in credit is likely to be slow, shallow, and uneven. Credit capacity will continue to be weak as capital markets only partially offset weak credit growth from banks. Moreover, ballooning sovereign borrowing needs and low credit supply could potentially lead to higher interest rates or less credit availability for the private sector. ### ### New risks: Rising sovereign credit risk Turning to the issue of sovereign risks. Following the crisis, the substantial increase in public debt and sharply higher sovereign risks are the most important challenges we flag in our report. Although much attention has been paid to Greece in this regard, fiscal concerns are not confined to one country. In particular, the average debt to GDP ratio of the major advanced economies is nearing its highest level since the second World War, without experiencing a world war. Indeed, the credit spreads of sovereigns have already widened in some economies as longer-run fiscal solvency concerns have been telescoped into short-term funding strains. Worries about default risk have risen and could undermine financial stability, especially if sovereign shocks are transmitted across borders or to banking systems. **New risks: Capital flows and bubbles** Lets now talk about emerging markets and the challenges associated with strong portfolio capital inflows into these economies. Clearly, the recovery in portfolio flows after their sharp collapse during the height of crisis is a welcome development, but for some countries there is the risk that the volume of these flows may become 'too much of a good thing.'\u009d Historically, a combination of strong capital flows, asset price increases, and credit accumulation have led to serious financial imbalances. Currently, we do not observe excessive credit or asset valuations systemwide. However, some hot spots have emerged, exhibiting elevated credit growth or asset prices. ** ****Policy messages** So what are the IMF's key policy messages? We have four. **1: Sovereign Risks** The first is that **careful management of sovereign risks is essential not only for the sustainability of public finances, but also for financial stability**. Policymakers must develop and communicate credible plans for achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability, combined with stronger fiscal institutions and improved public debt management frameworks, as well as other measures to mitigate the transmission of sovereign risks through financial channels. Failure to take timely actions to reduce sovereign risks could extend the crisis into a new phase, as we begin to reach the limits of public sector support for the financial system and the economy. **2: Support credit growth and smooth deleveraging** The second policy priority is to ensure a smooth deleveraging process that results in a safer, competitive, and vibrant financial system. Rebuilding capital buffers and securing stable funding for banks are necessary to provide adequate credit supply to support the recovery. Nonviable banks should be resolved swiftly and viable ones restructured, to ensure that once public support measures are removed, a healthy core of viable financial institutions remains. In the interim, policies may still be needed to sustain an adequate flow of credit to the private sector, including support for safe securitization and a careful exit from extraordinary monetary and financial support measures. **3: Managing Capital Inflows** Our third policy message relates to capital inflows. Policymakers in countries receiving strong capital flows will need to employ a wide range of tools to address the risk of rapid asset price increases and credit accumulation. Macro-policy adjustments and prudential measures are the main lines of defense. In some circumstances, temporary capital controls could also be considered. However, in all cases, an effective policy response must take a medium-term view to preserve the benefits of globalization, while ensuring lasting macroeconomic and financial stability in receiving countries. **4: Establish Basis for a Safer, Competitive, and Vital Financial System** Our last, but by no means least policy message is that we need to continue pushing for policies and reforms that establish the basis for a safer, competitive, and vibrant financial system. On the regulatory front, there are a host of initiatives underway to improve capital and liquidity buffers, to enhance risk management, to address procyclicality, to reduce the likelihood and costs of the failure of a systemic institution, and to strengthen market infrastructures. What is important now is that these initiatives are agreed and then implemented in a timely, effective, and internationally consistent manner. ** Financial stability at a crossroads** In conclusion, in spite of recent improvements in the outlook and the health of the global financial system, stability is not yet assured. If the legacy of the present crisis and emerging sovereign risks are not addressed, we run the very real risk of undermining the recovery and extending the financial crisis into a new phase. We can avoid this outcome with appropriate policy actions to restore the health of sovereign balance sheets and financial institutions. This must be accompanied by the regulatory reforms needed to move to a safer and more resilient global financial system. ", "index": 716}, {"pub": "4/19/2010", "title": "Emerging Market Countries and the Crisis: How Have They Coped?", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1331", "content": " By [Reza Moghadam **How time flies: only a year ago, we were in the throes of the **[**biggest global crisis since the Great Depression****.** As the extent of the damage to institutions in financial centers became evident'starkly highlighted by the Lehman bankruptcy'and the crisis started to affect emerging market economies (EMs), a timely and coordinated countercyclical response was launched. This helped stave off the worst of the crisis. The IMF supported the global response by [increasing its resources and [overhauling its lending framework to help those facing financing pressures. A [recovery is now taking hold in many parts of the world. Six months ago, we took a preliminary look at the [design and performance of IMF-supported programs in emerging markets. In a forthcoming paper, we are casting a wider net'examining factors that determined the extent to which a broader group of EMs were affected by the crisis, the policy measures they have taken, factors shaping the ongoing recovery, and sustainability considerations over the medium term. In a nutshell, we find that _countries that improved their policy fundamentals and reduced their vulnerabilities in the pre-crisis period generally came out ahead during the crisis_: they experienced smaller growth collapses, had more 'space'\u009d to take countercyclical policy measures, and are recovering faster from the crisis. I describe below our results in more detail. **Impact** The initial impact of the crisis'whether measured in terms of output contraction or widening of sovereign spreads'was, as expected, more pronounced in EMs that were more integrated with the global economy through trade and capital flows. However, accounting for these linkages, the impact was less intense in countries with better pre-crisis fundamentals and lower external vulnerability indicators. [ Holding more reserves helped, but only up to a point. Emerging markets with greater pre-crisis holdings of international reserves relative to external financing needs'perceived insurance against external vulnerability'saw smaller output contractions. But this effect was pronounced only when reserves cover was low or moderate. For countries with ample reserves, having more reserves carried little additional benefit. [ Avoiding excesses in the banking sector also helped. Countries that had domestic credit booms in the run up to the crisis tended to experience credit busts during the crisis; these busts were more pronounced in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes.** ** **Response** Countries that entered the crisis with more policy space and less binding financing constraints were able to react with more aggressive fiscal and monetary stimuli. Those with lower public debt and better budget balances going into the crisis were able to accommodate the economic downturn better by letting their fiscal positions ease more substantially. Similarly, those with lower pre-crisis inflation and sovereign spreads were able to cut interest rates more. There is also evidence that the exchange rate regime mattered'flexible regimes were able to provide greater monetary stimulus. **Recovery** There is evidence that countries that were able to increase public spending more rapidly have experienced faster recoveries, providing a concrete example of how better fundamentals'or more policy space'have helped. The positive role of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism is also becoming evident: countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes are recovering faster. [ **Exit** As emerging markets exit the crisis, they will need to tackle sharply different policy challenges. Those that entered the crisis with high vulnerabilities face larger output losses (relative to pre-crisis projections). If current account deficits persist, their external debt-to-GDP ratios could remain elevated. Thus, this group of EMs will need to sustain adjustment over the medium term to bring vulnerabilities back down to more moderate levels. [ On the other hand, those with better pre-crisis fundamentals are already facing a cyclical conundrum: while recovery in output and emerging inflation pressures would normally imply higher policy rates (in a Taylor rule framework), such actions in the face of continued accommodative policies in the advanced economies could prompt excessive capital inflows, possibly fueling asset price bubbles. This may be why many fast-recovering emerging markets are taking a cautious approach in withdrawing monetary stimulus. **Lessons** Fortunately, a crisis of this magnitude is a rare event. But the varied experience of emerging markets during this crisis underscores an important lesson: good policies beget good outcomes. Investing during good times to develop a sound policy framework that delivers stronger fundamentals and lower vulnerabilities yields large dividends during crises. In the current crisis, low-vulnerability countries had lower output declines, more space to undertake countercyclical policies, and quicker recoveries. Cross posted in the [Huffington Post.

Chapter 1 comes out next week. [Chapter 2, published today, focuses on two questions facing policymakers attempting to reform the financial landscape. One, whether systemic risk would be reduced by placing all regulatory functions under the purview of one entity'be that a single agency or an overseeing council? And two, if we were to use capital surcharges on financial institutions to try to limit the systemic risk associated with domino-like failures, how would we construct such surcharges? Let us stress that, we do not have 'the'\u009d answer to these difficult questions, but we think we have been able to frame the debate in a constructive way and provide guidance to policymakers on these important issues. For instance, we do not necessarily see a capital surcharge on systemically important institutions as the only way to reduce systemic risk, but as one method of a multipronged approach. There is a need to examine a number of approaches to see which one or which combination will do the job best. [Chapter 3 takes a slightly different tack by delving into how we can improve market infrastructure to help limit systemic risk. As you are aware, the over-the- counter derivatives market has been under scrutiny since problems in the credit default swap market arose with Lehman's bankruptcy and AIG's near miss. The IMF looks closely at the how central counterparties for clearing these contracts can be a shock-absorber in the financial system. [Chapter 4 looks ahead to the vulnerabilities that may be building up in some countries partly as a result of the low interest rates and ample liquidity that has characterized the main advanced economies' current monetary policy stances. The chapter documents that global liquidity plays a role in capital inflows to emerging and some other advanced countries where interest rates are higher and growth prospects are stronger. Certainly, an increase in capital inflows is a positive development following their dramatic decline during the height of the crisis, but they can be too much of a good thing if they add to inflation pressures or asset price bubbles. The chapter looks closely at the policy options that liquidity receiving economies can use. It suggests that, as a first-best solution, macroeconomic policies, including flexible exchange rates, and enhanced prudential regulations for the financial sector, can go a long way in managing a surge of capital inflows. It also reviews the international experience with capital controls.

Nevertheless, the downturn has heightened the core challenges that countries faced before the crisis took hold.**_ _Among these, one that stands out in the countries of the Middle East and North Africa is youth employment'or a lack of it. Simply put, the region is facing unparalleled demographic pressures. Population growth over the past two generations has been among the fastest in the world: the region's work force is projected to reach 185 million in 2020, 80 percent higher than in 2000. And the region is one of the most youthful in the world'with about 60 percent of the population less than 25 years old. But employment growth has lagged far behind the demands of growing populations, even when the region was experiencing good economic growth. Now with growth rates likely to be more modest after the crisis, the task of generating enough jobs for young men and women is becoming more challenging. Job creation must therefore be a top policy priority going forward. **Softening the impact** Creating meaningful jobs in any economy is difficult and requires action on different fronts. In the Middle East, historically people have looked to the government to provide jobs but increasingly it is clear that a thriving private sector is key to creating meaningful, productive jobs on the required scale. Of course, governments still have a critical role in providing a sound macroeconomic and financial environment in which the private sector will operate, and in ensuring that the educational and training systems in each country provide students with the skills and aptitude they will need to be successful workers in the 21st century. How can the International Monetary Fund (IMF) help in this regard? Mainly by working closely with the countries of the Middle East and North Africa to help devise policies that provide for macroeconomic stability and spur strong and sustainable economic growth that is essential to creating employment. But the economic challenges of the next generation also require a broader engagement'one that must include the young people who will inevitably be called upon to address these challenges as they enter into business, government, academia, and other walks of life. **Talking with the next generation** With this in mind, the IMF has started to engage with the young people of the region to help define forward-looking solutions. Part of this effort is a Middle East Youth Dialog 'a series of roundtable discussions with students from renowned universities across the region. From Morocco to Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan, IMF staff have sat down with the next generation of leaders to discuss the policy measures needed to secure sustainable economic growth that, in turn, will help generate new employment opportunities. This new initiative includes the establishment of a [social networking site where young people of the region are encouraged to transcend their own borders by sharing their questions, concerns, and visions of their economic futures. On April 4, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn meets with about 50 students in Amman, Jordan, for a town hall meeting at the culmination of the roundtable discussions. The session is being broadcast live via [BBC Arabic on television, radio, and the internet. Beyond this groundbreaking event, additional roundtables are planned for other countries in the region, as well as continued discussions on the social networking site. These first steps take place as countries of the Middle East and North Africa begin to rebuild the momentum of growth to help their citizens fully benefit from the opportunities of the 21st century. And that includes the youth whose future we all will depend on.

Let me illustrate this with two examples of trust fund programs that we are currently developing. A program on Tax Policy and Administration aims at helping countries mobilize more domestic resources in support of investment toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals, while also reducing their aid dependency. Another program on Managing Natural Resource Wealth aims to help countries by addressing the related serious governance and policy challenges in a comprehensive way to avoid the 'resource curse'\u009d and instead seize the opportunity for accelerated development. **Integration with regional centers** These trust fund programs are intended to be at the vanguard of international best practice in delivering [technical assistance, often supported by an agenda for applied research. Compared with the regional centers, they tackle more complex, diagnostic, and strategic issues within their field of specialization, but devolve reform implementation to the regional centers, which provide hands-on institution and capacity building. In countries and regions that are not being served by a regional center, they fill the gap and also cover implementation of reforms in their topical area. [Topical trust funds have several advantages over more traditional forms of assistance delivery. For recipient countries, they increase the project scope and resources available for capacity building, thus making the assistance more predictable in the medium term. They promote coordination between donors and assistance providers'as called for in the 2005 [Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness'and so avoid costly duplication. They also provide donors with a menu of topics to support, depending on their development strategies and priorities, while using the Fund's technical expertise and existing apparatus for assistance delivery and follow-up. For the IMF, trust funds enable collective action in areas of common interest, and leverage the Fund's own resources in strategic priority areas. The overarching objective is to help meet the continuously rising needs of countries, particularly of low- and lower-middle-income countries seeking to build the institutions and capacity needed to implement growth-enhancing policies. **Strategic guidance** Topical trust funds build on the positive experience with the successful governance model of our other multidonor trust funds, including the [regional technical assistance centers. They are guided by a steering committee comprising donor representatives and IMF staff. International and regional institutions and assistance providers in the relevant field can be invited to participate as observers. The steering committees provide strategic guidance and contribute to the setting of policies and priorities, including review and endorsement of an annual work plan. They also provide a forum for donors to coordinate assistance, exchange information, and expand their networks. The first topical trust fund on [Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism became operational in May 2009. Further trust funds are planned for 2010, including the ones I already mentioned on Tax Administration and Policy and on Managing Natural Resource Wealth, which are both at an advanced stage of development. Topics of other programs that are at the earlier stages of development include fiscal management, sustainable debt strategies, financial stability statistics, and training in Africa.

Their objective is to assist countries in designing and implementing their poverty reduction and broader developmental strategies and help countries integrate into the world economy. For example, they help strengthen public financial management, and so improve governance and transparency, facilitating donors' use of budget support instruments. They help improve tax and customs administration, providing an environment that is more conducive to investment and growth, increasing the resource envelope for poverty reducing spending and reducing the opportunities for corruption. At the same time, such reforms facilitate trade and enable countries to take better advantage of the forces of globalization. Each center is staffed with resident advisors whose mix of expertise reflects the technical assistance needs of the group of countries they serve. The centers are close to the countries they serve and flexible in their delivery of services, making them well placed to handle reform implementation issues on a day-to-day basis. Resident advisors at regional centers are able to develop deep knowledge of the circumstances and needs of the countries, including cross-cutting and regional issues, and provide intensive and constant follow-up on assistance delivered. As beneficiary countries have phrased it: 'They are just a phone call away'\u009d and will accompany the government all the way in implementing economic reforms, including overcoming practical obstacles by working through the nitty-gritty details and putting together the nuts and bolts. **Economies of scale** Regional centers can naturally exploit economies of scale. Neighboring countries typically have similar economic structures and assistance needs, and a regional approach enables more help to be delivered at lower cost. An added benefit is that regional centers can promote the sharing of reform experiences between countries, allowing officials to adopt tried and tested best practices while minimizing reform risks. Last but not least, they can be excellent vehicles to furthering regional harmonization and integration efforts of the beneficiary countries. Quite deliberately, the groupings of beneficiary countries of most regional centers mirror those of relevant regional organizations with whom the centers can work on coordination of economic policies and harmonization of standards, while integrating these into their work with country authorities. Using the regional center as a vehicle for their regional integration efforts was the dominant motivation of the countries requesting help from our recently opened center for Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. They had long realized that the region would fare better through deeper economic integration and collective insertion into the global economy. The center is set to support the countries' push for integration, including, for example, their plans for a regional customs union, free trade agreements with other regions, and regional aspects of banking supervision and regulation. One of the strongest features of the regional centers is their governance structure, which integrates all stakeholders. All regional centers are guided by steering committees comprising representatives from donors, beneficiary countries, and other international agencies. This helps promote aid coordination and ownership of reforms, in line with the objectives of the [Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. These steering committees provide strategic guidance for the centers' work plans, through a consultative process that helps build shared ownership of the assistance delivered. As my colleague [Antoinette Sayeh confirmed in [her recent post, countries like the regional centers because they are close and have an inclusive governance model. At their request, and given the positive feedback by all stakeholders, we are seeking to scale up the regional approach to technical assistance by expanding the scale of operations of many of the existing centers and by opening new centers: in addition to the new center for Central America that opened in 2009, further plans include a new center in Central Asia and two additional ones in Africa. When complete, the 10 regional centers will cover 102 countries, including all of sub-Saharan Africa.

The 'Flying Geese Paradigm'\u009d or _ganko keitai_ was first conceived of by Japanese economist, Kaname Akamatsu in the 1930s as a way of explaining East Asian industrial development. According to Akamatsu, the lead goose in the formation, was Japan. The second tier consisted of newly industrialized economies'South Korea, Taiwan Province of China, Singapore, and Hong Kong SAR. Following hot on their tails were the ASEAN countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. More recent additions to the flock are China and India As the 'lead goose'\u009d lost its comparative advantage, it would shift further away from labor-intensive production to more capital intensive activities. Meanwhile, those labor intensive activities would move to nations further down the hierarchy. To take a simple example, the textile industry was abandoned in Japan as labor costs rose, but also, at a later stage, by countries in the second tier, South Korean and Taiwan. According to this model, as each goose ahead in the formation trades and invests with neighboring countries, those latter countries, in their turn take off to become the next growth driver. But the emergence of successive waves of new growth drivers not only benefits Asia, through the creation of trade and investment linkages and greater Asian integration, the formation of North-South economic linkages means wider benefits accrue. Akamatsu's model is little known in the West, despite its fame in the economist's home country, perhaps because it later became used as intellectual underpinning for Japanese imperialism during the war. But advocates for the model might point to the current pattern of economic growth for validation. Despite the sharp downturn globally in 2008, for most of 2009, Asia as a whole recorded higher growth than the rest of the world and the region is currently leading the global recovery. This trend is expected to continue this year and into the next, with the International Monetary Fund predicting that Asia will grow about 7 percent annually. ### Strong recovery There are many reasons for this strong recovery. One major factor is the bold stimulus policies undertaken in China, their pattern of vertical integration in manufacturing and the demand for natural resources and capital goods created by 'the Middle Kingdom'\u009d and by India. All of which have had a domino effect regionally and globally. If we accept the flying geese paradigm, it is already possible to spot the next tier of geese ready to take wing. Those countries, like Cambodia, Laos and Nepal, who are preparing for economic take off. As yet, their per capital income levels may be low, but they are the next emerging economies and their populations will provide the next large market of middle-class consumers. These countries have huge potential. Of course possessing potential and realizing it is not the same thing. Countries need to make the most of their potential by being well prepared with sound macroeconomic policies and a robust financial sector. Alone, these are not sufficient factors, but they are necessary preconditions. Our job at the IMF is to encourage those countries as they prepare to take flight which is why the Fund has organized a one-day conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, for 22nd March, targeted at those developing countries in Asia The conference is looking at the impact of the global financial crises on these developing countries and identify the conditions which will raise these countries to the next level of development. As the IMF's mission chief for Vietnam, Masato Miyazaki, put it in an accompanying podcast 'even if we do nothing, these countries will move up the ladder [of development], of that is no doubt. But what we (at the IMF) want to do is to give the right kind of support and advice. Whenever they turn to us, we stand ready.'\u009d We, at the IMF would take great pleasure in seeing another goose fly.

They help IMF member countries identify weaknesses in policies and institutional frameworks, develop concrete reform proposals and strategies, and put together the nuts and bolts for translating the IMF's policy advice into concrete implementation of reforms. [Technical assistance in the IMF's areas of core expertise is thus not only an important complement to the IMF's policy advice in many countries but also helps them pursue their broader developmental and poverty reduction strategies by strengthening their capacity in macroeconomic management. Our technical assistance is also an important complement to the broader aid and development efforts of other bilateral and multilateral donors. For example, as my colleague [Carlo Cottarelli pointed out in his recent post, low-income countries need to continue improving the way they spend foreign aid. I firmly believe that the IMF must work closely with development partners to make our and their assistance more effective. Not only in terms of coordinating interventions and exploiting synergies, but also because the input from donors and other stakeholders makes IMF technical assistance better and more effective. It is a classical win-win proposition: while donors (and, of course, beneficiary countries) benefit from both the depth and breadth across countries of Fund expertise in its core areas, conversely the Fund benefits from donors' expertise in integrating interventions into their overall programs and managing them in a results-based framework. Our delivery of technical assistance is demand driven, that is, only provided upon request of the recipient country which is fully involved in the entire process of technical assistance, from identification of need, to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. ### Rising demand Before the financial crisis, demand for our technical assistance was already high and rising. The crisis and its after-effects have further boosted demand. This is particularly relevant in Africa, as [Antoinette Sayeh has noted, capacity building is essential in helping countries through the crisis. In the wake of the global slump, external donors are even more crucial to help us meet the rising need for technical assistance. Happily, donors generally recognize IMF technical assistance as a high quality product that achieves additional traction from its integration with the Fund's lending and surveillance activities and complements their own interventions in key areas. But we have not remained complacent. We have embarked on comprehensive reforms to make IMF technical assistance more attractive to donors. We have strengthened the governance and accountability of technical assistance, increased cost transparency, and are improving information-sharing through better dissemination of technical assistance-related information. ### Regional approach We also complemented our technical assistance product lines to better link up with donors' regional and thematic priorities. This has been done through the[ Regional Technical Assistance Centers and the Topical Trust Funds (more on them in a later post). The former provide multi-topic technical assistance, regionally; the latter operate globally but with a specialized topical focus. Both are organized as multi-donor trust funds. In addition, bilateral trust funds provide more specialized technical assistance focused on specific countries and topics customized to narrower donor priorities. All technical assistance interventions are prioritized and coordinated in a comprehensive allocation process that ensures the best use of resources and synergies to the benefit of recipient countries. We have already substantially scaled up our partnership with donors. Not only have we increased technical assistance under bilateral accounts, but, last year, we opened a new Regional Technical Assistance Center for Central America and Panama and started operations under the IMF's first topical trust fund on [Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism. Country needs are plentiful and we plan to further expand our technical assistance through new and scaled-up, regional centers, as well as through more topical trust funds. More in my next posts.

The IMFC wanted to ensure that the IMF is able to cover'and I quote here from the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 that was issued in October 2009''the full range of macro and financial sector policies that bear on macroeconomic global stability.'\u009d The conclusions of this work will be discussed at our upcoming Annual Meetings in Washington D.C. The issues are rather complex, as you can imagine. We will be issuing a series of papers for discussion by the IMF's Executive Board in the coming months. Our first discussion paper was published on February 26. The paper pointed to three main challenges for the IMF in the years to come: **'\u00a2 Crisis prevention.** The IMF's surveillance covers both economic policies in individual member countries, and developments relating to the global economy as a whole. But in practice, the bulk of the IMF's efforts have been at the country level. Thus, just as national regulatory oversight after the crisis is shifting from assessing risk in individual institutions to assessing risk to the entire financial system, so too the Fund's surveillance needs to adapt to the times. More attention should be given to the buildup of systemic risk, linkages, and spillovers across economies, with such analysis hardwired into the Fund's standard surveillance procedures. The analysis of financial sector policies is particularly important if the Fund is to be ahead of the curve in crises. **'\u00a2 Crisis response.** The crisis has shown that the IMF's resources must be available with speed, coverage, and size far beyond previous assumptions. Far-reaching reforms were introduced during the crisis, but more can be done to deliver financing in a more flexible manner. It is particularly important that the Fund be able to handle systemic'as opposed to country-level'crises, with the capacity to offer short-term swap lines of the kind the U.S. Fed and other central banks made available at the start of this crisis (but which cannot be taken for granted in future ones). **'\u00a2 Stability of reserves.** The crisis has also cast a spotlight on the tension between the high demand for global liquidity by emerging market economies and the dependence on the stability of just a few suppliers of such liquidity. If the IMF's ability to prevent and respond to crises is strengthened, this could help alleviate countries' perceived need to accumulate vast reserves. It may also make sense for the Fund to back the use of a global reserve asset and other initiatives that could reduce risk in the international monetary system. **Collecting ideas** ** ** As part of our strategy, we have initiated a public consultation with various stakeholders, including governments, private sector, academia, think tanks, non-governmental and civil society organizations, and the wider public. We would welcome views on the three key areas of outlined above: **surveillance, financing, and the stability of the international monetary system**. It goes without saying that wider reform of Fund governance is key to the legitimacy of any mandate, new or old. But this is a question the membership is tackling on a separate track, including'but not limited to'the redistribution of quotas in line with fundamental changes in the relative size and role of countries, notably of dynamic emerging market countries. Stakeholders will be able to submit ideas and comments by using the [on-line consultation platform we have created for this purpose. The consultation period runs through May 15, 2010. During this period, interested stakeholders can submit their comments on the overview note (released on February 22) and the follow up papers that will be posted in due course on imf.org. The inputs from the consultation process will feed into the final report being prepared for the Annual Meetings. We expect to make the comments and inputs received in this process available on the IMF website after May 15, 2010. My colleagues and I look forward to hearing your ideas!

While recognizing that Zambia, just like Kenya and South Africa, has its own unique characteristics, I have pulled together some common threads from what I have been hearing in Africa over the past several days. Three main themes come through: First, Africa is a **different place** from how it is often portrayed in the popular media. Thanks to [sound economic policies in many countries over the past decade or so, Africa has been able to withstand this crisis much better than has been the case in the past. The fact that the crisis hit Africa anyway does not mean that the policies were wrong. On the contrary, those policies helped to buffer Africa from the worst of the crisis, and they should now be strengthened. All three national leaders with whom I met'President Kibaki of Kenya, President Zuma of South Africa, and President Banda of Zambia'conveyed to me their strong sense of the [policy agenda ahead. Second, the issue of **governance **emerged loudly, clearly, and frankly in my discussions in all three countries. In fact, I get the impression that it would be almost impossible to have a public discussion in Africa without this issue coming up. That's a good thing and, again, very different from the past. At the same time, talking about governance and doing something about it are two different things. One encouraging point is clear to me: civil society in Africa has found its voice'and it calls for accountability. It calls for transparency. It calls out against corruption. If governments are wise'and I think most will be'they will listen to that voice more and more. Not only can that help give them further moral and political standing in the eyes of their people, it will help them to govern more effectively. Third, the question of **Africa's relationship with the world **takes on an even greater importance in the 21st century global world than it did in the 20th century colonial world. I have said often now that Africa was an 'innocent victim'\u009d of the crisis. And so it was. But nevertheless it was affected. Because global financial linkages with Africa are weak, the continent was hardly touched at first; but then the crisis deepened and Africa was hit hard in areas of investment, trade, and even aid (as crisis-hit donor countries sought ways to cut back on commitments). The lesson: no country is immune from global shocks. In my discussions in Africa, people often raised the issues of global financial regulation, global imbalances, and the global economic shift that is taking place'from the West to the East. The **[role of China in Africa**, for example, is a topic that came up in all three countries I visited. Zambia's special relationship with China, of course, goes back to the 1970s and the building of the famous TAZARA railroad. Economic relations between the two countries have intensified since then, primarily in the mining and construction sectors. Chinese investment in Zambia, and in Africa, is to be welcomed. At the same time, it is important that all foreign investment in Africa should make economic sense from the African perspective'and be fair. Finally, one other dimension of my discussions fell much closer to home: **the role and reputation of the IMF**. I found that the stereotype of the Fund as 'the bad guy'\u009d persists in some quarters. I also found that there was not enough understanding'beyond official circles'of the [major changes that the IMF has undertaken over the last couple of years: the tripling of our lending to sub- Saharan Africa, at zero interest rates, to help them weather the crisis; the streamlining of conditionality; the emphasis on countercyclical policy and the preservation of public spending, particularly for the social sectors. And more. This suggests to me the need for two things going forward: * the IMF needs to strengthen even further its policy advice in Africa, and * it must communicate and engage even more to counter the outdated image of the Fund, and to build a better understanding of who we really are today'and that the IMF is Africa's institution. I leave Africa recognizing that the IMF has a way to go in [strengthening its partnership with the continent. But at the same time'and building on the meeting that I had with the African countries in Tanzania last year'I leave encouraged that the journey is well under way.

And it's not just World Cup fever'though there are plenty of signs of that too.** By some estimates, close to 10 million people are expected to visit South Africa this summer for the football (soccer) extravaganza'a further boost to its economy and its image in the world. South Africa is a global player. This country has long been seen as the growth hub in the south and eastern part of the continent. But this past year, as a member of the G-20 group of nations, South Africa has come to be seen as much more-an emerging market, yes. And now also an influence on how global decisions are shaped. This is a new role for Africa in the world'and a new way for Africa to be seen by the world. I see President Zuma regularly at these G-20 meetings. It has been a special pleasure to meet him again in his homeland and to see him at work in leading the economic and political forces at play in a young country that puts forward a vision for itself in the 21st century. From the IMF's perspective, South Africa weathered the financial crisis well'with a set of pragmatic countercyclical policies that enabled the country to withstand its first recession in 20 years. It is no surprise that, in 2009, growth fell below the average 4.2 percent achieved during 2000-2008. But the worst appears to be over and we expect a relatively healthy 2.5 percent in 2010. That does not mean that there are no challenges ahead. Quite the contrary, there are some big ones. And in my discussions with South Africans'over dinner with the Minister of Finance and other ministers, with business leaders over breakfast, and with a wonderful group of young students at the University of the Witwatersrand'they did not shy away from laying out what they saw as the priorities to be addressed. They include: '\u008f **_Tackling unemployment._** South Africa lost close to 1 million jobs last year. And, in a country of about 50 million people, unemployment is expected to peak at around 25 percent. That's a lot of people without jobs. Too many. Growth has resumed, but job creation is as yet anemic'a problem which South Africa shares with many of the advanced countries also trying to recover from the financial crisis. Where are the jobs going to come from? It's a huge challenge for South Africa, for Europe, and for the United States in the post- crisis world. '\u008f **_Reducing inequality._** A little known fact: South Africa has now surpassed Brazil as having the highest level of inequality in the world. South Africa has taken remarkable steps to address apartheid-related injustices in housing, education, and health care. But much remains to be done. With one- third of the population less than 14 years old, social tensions can only fester if these young people grow up without a clear sense of a better quality of life for them and their families. '\u008f **_Building a flexible, competitive economy. _**A growing economy is not the only answer to meeting these challenges, but it is an indispensable ingredient. While here, I have been making the point that barriers to competition should be brought down across a number of key sectors'to strengthen South Africa's position in global markets. Other reforms to enhance flexibility in labor and product markets can also help. A successful global player needs to build resilience to global economic shocks. **Forward-looking society** These are tough challenges. Can South Africa meet them? There is no doubt in my mind that it can. This is a forward-looking, life-affirming society. I saw this in many places. But perhaps, above all, I saw it in Soweto where Anne and I visited an inspirational group called [Grassroot Soccer. Grassroots Soccer delivers HIV/AIDS counseling, as well as more general life skills, to youth. The group bases its work on the devastation wrought by AIDS'and the popularity of football (soccer). Over 300,000 kids have graduated from the program. As I watched those children play, I was filled with emotion'and inspiration. Yes, South Africa is going to meet its challenges.

That at least is my initial feeling after two days of dialogue in Kenya with President Kibaki and government officials, civil society leaders and trade unionists, academics and students, and ordinary Kenyans. \"Africa is back\" is how I described it in[ a live TV debate in Nairobi with Prime Minister Odinga, Minister of Finance Kenyatta, Nobel Laureate Wangari Mathai, Transparency International's Akere Muna and my friend, Bob Geldof. Too rosy a scenario? I don't think so. I have so far observed several clear themes in my African interactions, during a trip that is taking me to South Africa and Zambia, as well as Kenya: First, the **priority being given to [sound economic policy**. This may seem obvious, but it has not always been the case on the continent. It was good economic policies that helped buffer Africa during the crisis; and good economic policies are the key to the future-to bringing growth back to pre-crisis levels and to generating jobs. Second, the importance of **good governance**. And especially the new role of a vigorous civil society in that process. Again, obvious? Perhaps-but the open and frank airing of issues of corruption, transparency, and accountability have not always been the stuff of live TV debates in Africa. We had one of those on March 8 at the University of Nairobi. Third, there is a growing awareness of the importance of **Africa's role in, and relationships with, the rest of the world**-trade, investment flows, and aid too. I heard Bob Geldof make an inspirational and impassioned case why Africa would become a \"global growth pole\" by 2050. If that is to be achieved, of course, Africa will need to manage a swathe of global forces that will impact the future of the continent. One of those forces is **[climate change**-an issue again on which I observe an increasing awareness in Africa. With her Nobel-level knowledge and expertise, I was enthralled to listen to Wangari Mathai speak of Africa's potential leading edge in the area of \"green growth.\" In a speech entitled \"Africa's Economic Transformation,\" I also spoke of the idea of a \"green fund,\" with the capacity to raise $100 billion a year for both adaptation and mitigation-which could help break the impasse on the financing of climate change. While such a fund would not be managed by the IMF, our staff are working on something that, I believe, could be an important contribution to the global debate-and to the well-being of our planet in the 21st century. I am heartened that [Nick Stern, who has considerable credibility on this particular issue, feels the same way.\" You will hear more about this in the weeks ahead.

And what a difference a year has made!** This time last year, Africa was swept up into the vortex of the global financial crisis. The global recession struck Africa through several channels'exports collapsed, banks ran into trouble as non-performing loans grew, and investment diminished. Average growth in sub-Saharan Africa fell to 2 percent in 2009 from 5.6 percent the previous year. But [improved policies in the face of the crisis helped the continent get through the storm better than expected and at the IMF we anticipate that Africa will see a relatively quick recovery, with average growth bouncing back to 4\u00c2? percent this year and 5\u00c2? percent in 2011. [African countries were able to take appropriate measures to mitigate the turbulence because policies before the crisis were good, allowing them to build reserves, cut debt, and open up fiscal space to combat the recession. The achievement is Africa's, but the IMF and the international community played a role as well'small but important. We, and others, provided assistance during the turbulence and stepped up cooperation through policy advice and analysis. **An advocate for Africa** The IMF's close partnership with Africa is symbolized by a [historic conference that we organized with the Government of Tanzania this time last year that focused on building successful partnerships to meet Africa's growth challenges. At that conference, the IMF committed to improving its policies and operational approaches in Africa. And I pledged to ensure Africa's concerns would be taken into account during the meetings of the [Group of Twenty (G-20) industrialized and emerging market countries and be an advocate for Africa. Now, as I visit Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia on my third trip to the region in the past 12 months, I'd like to present the scorecard of how the IMF has delivered on our promises. * **Evenhandedness**. We are working to ensure that our policy advice speaks to the needs of all our member countries and we are assisting the G-20 in a process of mutual assessment of their economic policies. * **Sharp jump in lending**. We vastly increased our commitments to sub-Saharan Africa, signing new arrangements'or augmenting existing ones'with some 20 countries. In 2009, we committed $3.6 billion in zero-interest lending to Africa, more than three times greater than in 2008. Our total commitments amounted to $5 billion. * **Revamped lending terms**. We have revamped our lending, moving toward less intrusive conditionality, focusing on core policy measures that are critical for stability, growth, and poverty reduction. And we make sure lending programs have sufficient measures to protect social spending and pro-poor initiatives. * **Supplementing reserves**. To relieve concerns about whether countries would be able to ride out the global financial crisis, IMF members approved a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs'an IMF international reserve asset. The new allocation pumped some $250 billion into the world economy, spread across our 186 members, including African members. * **Better representation**. We are working to reform our own governance in part so that our members in Africa and other countries have a larger say in what the IMF does. * **More technical assistance**. The IMF will add two new [regional technical assistance centers in Ghana and Mauritius to supplement our three well-established regional centers in Tanzania, Mali, and Gabon. * **Catalytic role**. We are moving quickly to adopting a more flexible approach to looking at debt dynamics that will help countries, where infrastructure needs are so great, to access the financing they need to meet their development goals. **More challenges ahead** African policymakers met the challenges of the global financial crisis head on, but they still have a daunting to-do list. The region will remain highly vulnerable to commodity price shocks, natural disasters and, in some cases, political instability. How to combat climate change is also a major consideration here in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa. Over the course of this week, I look forward to discussing with and listening to a broad range of [African partners'from heads of state to students, from trade unionists to aid workers, and leaders of civil society as well. Yes, we have come a long way over the past year. But we have still a very long way to go in the task of helping Africa meet the challenges of the 21st century.

The questions I attempted to answer have included: In what shape and form will European integration survive the crisis? Will eastern Europe be able to sustain its remarkable catching up with living standards in western Europe? For my final blog in this series on [iMFdirect, I have decided to add a personal touch and draw on my experience as a former policymaker. So while this article builds on the previous five posts, it goes beyond them and includes some highly subjective comments on what lessons I believe the reformers in eastern Europe should take away from the crisis. And, although my primary focus is on countries outside the eurozone, it is clear that the eurozone will need to address long-term challenges, as I pointed out in my post [After the Crisis, Much Still at Stake for Eurozone. **** **Transition has been an undisputed success** The transition from central planning to market-based economies remains an undisputed success. Despite the crisis, a market-based economy remains 'the only game in town,'\u009d and nobody speaks of centrally planned socialism as a viable alternative. Moreover, the social fiber in the emerging market economies looks robust. For now at least, there is no serious social unrest in sight. European integration has served the countries in eastern Europe well. In the run-up to membership of the European Union (EU), institutions were strengthened, and new members were granted access to the EU's single market. During the global economic crisis, structural funds from the EU provided a healthy addition to the flow of investment, and those countries that were hit the hardest were able to access the EU balance of payments facility. However, the [EU 'halo'\u009d 'whereby emerging markets were shielded, by virtue of their EU membership, from paying more to borrow external funds'is now gone. Today, what you do yourself in terms of policies matters more. So what are the big takeaways for policymakers from the crisis? **Good policies and strong institutions matter.** Countries with unsustainable fiscal policies and weak institutions were the first to fall and they also had less space to react to the crisis with fiscal stimulus. But good policies go beyond fiscal and monetary responses. They must extend to bank regulation and supervision, and more generally to the quality of public institutions. Two examples spring immediately to mind. Estonia's strong institutions and political determination made it possible for the country to keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of GDP during a time of extreme decline in economic activity. Romania's independent and well-managed central bank helped the country survive a potential liquidity crisis during the recent presidential campaign. **Good fiscal policies start in good times. **If you think growth and prosperity is for relaxing and enjoying, rather than to save for a rainy day, you can forget about fiscal stimulus when it's needed or even allowing automatic stabilizers to do their job during a recession. And fiscal stabilizers are back in fashion! In the past, in eastern Europe, a crisis used to be automatically associated with expenditure cuts. Now, we are Keynesians again'the message comes from the West, and from some countries in the East, notably the Czech Republic and Poland, which were able to afford fiscal stimulus. Remember to keep an eye on expenditures. Even if the budget looks great in boom times, in a bust tax revenues fall and leave you dangerously exposed. Also, you cannot have a tax system that resembles that of Hong Kong if you also want social services on par with those of Scandinavia. **Capital inflows are great, but some are better than others.** Those that increase your output potential deserve support, but those that just stimulate demand have to be watched carefully. Trying to curtail unwanted capital flows, for instance through prudential regulations, may in some cases be necessary to ensure financial stability. [Capital controls, at least in certain situations, should not be ruled out. **Selling domestic banks to foreigners (highly controversial in some emerging markets) turned out to be a rather good idea.** Foreign-owned banks helped to rapidly create a modern and efficient financial sector in the region. They also came with a long-term investment horizon and in the current crisis have shown a willingness to maintain their exposure. Market and competitive pressure due to opening of banking markets also helped strengthen domestically-owned banks. For example, Poland's PKO BP and Russia's Sberbank, both domestically owned, weathered the crisis remarkably well. But other domestically-owned banks such as Parex in Latvia and OTP in Hungary, ran into trouble (even if it was the country risk that did most of the damage for OTP). What really matters is whether banks have a sustainable business model, one that is not dependent on short-term wholesale funding. **Self-regulation of the private sector has its limits.** The ultimate responsibility for a country's economy rests with the state. Bailout is the catchword of the day, as emerging market reformers in Europe look to their former role models in the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere. This does not imply a return to an omnipotent 'socialist'\u009d state with infamous quantitative targets and public ownership. But it does imply that if things go really wrong, the taxpayer may be forced to foot the bill. **Pragmatism, pragmatism, pragmatism.** Many (maybe naive) policymakers in the East must feel almost betrayed by the ease with which the rules of market discipline have been abandoned in the West to avoid social unrest and preserve political stability. We have to provide much more refined policy messages to emerging economies. As these economies advance, so does the sophistication of their policymakers. **In times of need, you can count on the IMF.** The Fund has listened, learned, and adapted. It is not a bad cop, but rather a doctor. A visit to our clinic may not the most pleasant experience, but for how long can you go on simply with painkillers? And the IMF has become better at understanding its patients' many different needs. After all, everybody is learning.

The global financial crisis has renewed the debate over the desirability of capital flows to emerging economies. Adding fuel to this debate is the fact that two of the world's largest emerging economies'China and India'have experienced strong growth and relatively limited fallout from the crisis, all the while maintaining hefty restrictions on the flow of foreign capital. What can be done to ensure that emerging economies still benefit from productive foreign capital, while reducing the risks associated with highly volatile flows? Can we throw out the bathwater, but keep the baby? **The case of emerging ****Europe** In emerging Europe, the transition from planned economies to capitalism has resulted in a rapid and near-complete openness to trade and foreign capital. In the years before the crisis, foreign money flowed generously to the region and to banks in particular. This precipitated a credit boom'with banks extending loans to households and firms on an unprecedented scale. Once the crisis hit, the boom turned to bust. And although the withdrawal of foreign capital was less aggressive than initially feared, it is clear that the large pre-crisis capital flows to the region were unsustainable and destabilizing. **Macroeconomic policy options ** So, what are the options for dealing with large capital flows? The tradeoffs arising from macroeconomic policies are well-known: * **_Exchange rate appreciation_**. Allowing the exchange rate to appreciate can lead to overvaluation and is not an option for countries with exchange rate pegs. To reduce pressures on the exchange rate, interest rates can be cut, provided that inflation is not a concern. * **_Reserve accumulation_**. Accumulating international reserves can be effective for a while if reserves are deemed to be too low. However, if purchases of foreign currency are _unsterilized_'if they increase domestic liquidity'inflation may become a problem. And _sterilized_ intervention can become self-defeating, as rising interest rates create a more attractive destination for foreign capital. * **_Fiscal policy_**. Fiscal policy can be tightened, but there are limits (both political and economic). And strong fiscal or external positions can end up attracting even more inflows. Just look at Russia'as reserves increased by some $500 billion in the pre-crisis years, investors lent the private sector roughly the same amount. **An expanded toolkit** Since macroeconomic policies may not be enough to deal with massive inflows of foreign capital, the toolkit has to include other instruments. Strengthening the prudential framework can help mitigate the adverse consequences of surging capital inflows, but other options'notably controls on capital inflows'may also need to be considered. In emerging Europe, stronger prudential regulations could have gone a long way to reducing the credit boom fueled by foreign capital. * **_Limiting foreign currency lending_**. Many of the loans to emerging European households in the boom years were denominated in foreign currency (such as Swiss francs), even though these households only had income in domestic currency. This type of 'currency mismatch'\u009d created significant risks not only to households'who faced very large increases in their loan payments when their currency depreciated'but also to banks'because when households could no longer afford their loans, they defaulted. Thus, one possible prudential measure would be to limit (or potentially ban) foreign currency lending to borrowers without foreign currency income. * **_'Countercyclical regulatory requirements.'\u009d_** Put simply, these require banks to hold extra capital in good times that would serve as a buffer in bad times. Operationally, these requirements mean that banks would have fewer funds to lend out in good times, which would help to dampen a credit boom. Countries that took such measures in the run-up to the crisis had mixed success, but this might mean that a more aggressive effort may be needed going forward. But what if foreign capital is not just flowing into banks? And what if it is, in fact, an unintended consequence of policies in other countries? In many countries in emerging Europe, companies besides banks borrowed directly from foreign investors. And some of the foreign funds that the region attracted came from investors in search for yield, given low interest rates in advanced economies. In such situations, capital controls could provide a useful remedy. * **_Capital controls to reduce investors' returns_**. Such [capital controls can be in the form of a direct tax (such as the ones recently introduced in Brazil and Taiwan) or an indirect tax (such as requirements that investors place a portion of the invested funds in non-interest bearing accounts). * **_Temporary in nature?_** But capital controls are not a panacea'they can be difficult to administer, they can be circumvented, and their effectiveness appears to decrease over time. This means that controls need to be part of a broad package of policies to deal with large capital flows. It also means that they may be most effective as a temporary response to adverse spillovers or distortions in the global financial system that are also likely to be temporary. **What next for the new member states** Finally, let us not forget that the challenges facing the new member states, which are constrained in their ability to impose capital controls by the rules of the European Union. For some of these countries, greater use of prudential regulations'following Poland's example'could be a first step. And given the broader debate underway on [financial transactions taxes in international fora, such as the G-20 group of advanced and emerging economies, the new member states should consider whether this form of regulation would be appropriate for their economies and take part in the discussion. **** **The bottom line** In our highly globalized economy, large and rapid flows of money across borders are here to stay. The challenge for emerging economies is to find ways to manage these flows so that they don't exacerbate boom-bust cycles, while still leaving the door open to productive (and hopefully stable) investment. This means using [all available tools, particularly greater use of prudential regulations, and keeping an open mind when it comes to capital controls. Note: also reproduced on [Huffington Post.

Several of the papers will be discussed at a conference to be held in Seoul, Korea, later this month. [IMF Survey magazine has interviewed the Fund's Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard on the reason for the rethink. 'It was tempting for macroeconomists and policymakers to take much of the credit for the steady decrease in cyclical fluctuations from the early 1980s on and to conclude that we knew how to conduct macroeconomic policy. We did not resist temptation. The crisis naturally forces us to question our earlier conclusions and that's what we are trying to do in this paper,'\u009d he's quoted as saying. Paul Krugman dubbed the paper \"interesting and important \" in his [New York Times blog, while Richard Adams in the _[Guardian_ described it as a 'break with years of economic orthodoxy'\u009d and a 'stunning turnaround.'\u009d **Intellectual guidance** An editorial in the _Financial Times_ said the paper demonstrates that the IMF intends to \"offer intellectual guidance to a profession confounded by its failure to see the crisis coming. **The short paper, the FT argues, **** cuts to the heart of what macroeconomics got wrong before the crisis and what it teaches us about how policy must change.** \"The paper also treads controversial ground,\" the FT writes. \" To speed up fiscal policy it moots automatic tax cuts or transfers triggered by thresholds such as a given rate of unemployment. It says central banks might aim for higher inflation to make room for more aggressive cuts. If not always convincing ' why seek higher inflation instead of tools to enable negative nominal rates? ' such high-calibre brainstorming is welcome. No less is needed to reform a failed orthodoxy of which the IMF was once the guardian.\" Weighing in, the [Economist's Free Exchange blog says: \"Perhaps the important thing to take away from this discussion is that to central bankers, inflation is a bogeyman. But to good economists, inflation is merely a variable, an economic indicator over which governments have some control and which they can manipulate to good or ill effect. \" **Better performance** Another interesting quote comes from Joseph Stiglitz in the French economic daily [La Tribune. Asked how the IMF handled the current crisis compared with the Asian crisis of the 1997-98, he said 'Much better than last time!'\u009d He attributed the improved response partly to the Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, known as DSK. 'We have been lucky that DSK, who was not wedded to past policies, was at the helm of this institution when the crisis occurred. The IMF advised large economies to implement stimulus policies whereas, during the crisis in [Asian] emerging markets at the end of the 1990's, the Fund had imposed austerity policies.\" ", "index": 731}, {"pub": "2/10/2010", "title": "Reigniting Growth in Emerging Europe", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=1164", "content": " By [Marek Belka **As the deep recession in Europe's emerging market countries finally comes to an end, the question on everyone's minds is where growth in the region will come from in the years ahead.** Exports are rebounding, and domestic demand is showing signs of stabilization. Most countries will see positive GDP growth this year'a stark difference from 2009. But a return to the high growth rates that preceded the crisis is highly unlikely. **An unbalanced picture** During the boom years, Eastern Europe grew rapidly, but growth in many countries was rather unbalanced. Capital inflows were large, but to a great extent went to the 'non-tradable'\u009d sector'in particular, real estate, construction, and banking. Capital flows boosted domestic demand rather than supply'leading to a surge in imports, current account deficits that widened to unprecedented levels, and overheating economies. This kind of growth will not come back. The domestic demand boom came to an end in the fall of 2008. In the global financial turmoil that followed the demise of Lehman Brothers, capital flows to Eastern Europe plunged, leading to a sharp decline in domestic demand. Further exacerbated by a decline in exports, this contributed a deep economic downturn'in the Baltics and Ukraine, GDP declined between 14 and 19 percent last year. Exports are now recovering, but domestic demand will likely stay weak: experience tells us that once credit booms end, consumers tend to rein in their spending for a long time as they pay off their debts . Instead, Emerging Europe will need to need to diversify away from non- tradables to tradables. Growth will need to come from manufacturing and services, rather than construction, real estate, and banking. Emerging Europe will need to find niches in the world market in which it can specialize and catch up by increasing its share in world markets, rather than by boosting its non-tradable sector. **Going back to basics** How can Emerging Europe do this? In short, by going back to basics. Emerging Europe has transformed itself many times before. It is only twenty years ago that the region began the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based one. Its economies are very flexible, and policymakers have repeatedly demonstrated that when things get tough, tough actions can be implemented quickly. Most important in this transformation will be the private sector. Market forces will help in transferring resources. During the boom years, real estate, construction, and finance were very profitable'much more so than manufacturing. Now that the boom in the non-tradable sector has come to an end, it is no longer as profitable. It is likely that this will have a stark impact on investment in this sector. When the housing price boom ended in the United States and the construction sector no longer was so profitable, residential construction declined by 75 percent. **Saving for a rainy day** Of course, public policies are important as well. Well designed macroeconomic policies and structural reforms can help restore growth. Macroeconomic policies can help prevent the overheating that pulls resources from the tradable to the non-tradable sector. Fiscal policy in particular could play a much more active role than it has in the past. When revenues are growing strongly, they should be used to build up fiscal buffers instead of increasing spending and boosting public wages. This may mean that during boom times small fiscal surpluses may not be sufficient: sometimes large or very large surpluses may be needed. This may sound unattractive to policymakers during boom times. But a large fiscal buffer also means that there is no need to cut expenditure sharply during a recession'as several countries were forced to during the current crisis. Preventing a repeat of the past overheating is particularly important as competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in many countries in Emerging Europe deteriorated during the boom years. Latvia was the most extreme case (according to European Union data, between 2003 and 2008, unit labor costs in manufacturing in Latvia increased by 90 percent relative to its trading partners), but Bulgaria (40 percent), and Estonia and Romania (30 percent) also lost competitiveness. That does not mean that competitiveness has _already_ become a problem'the market share of most countries has continued to rise'but it is clear that if this deterioration continues it will certainly become a problem eventually. Tighter fiscal policy during boom years will help moderate wage growth. Yes, over time, wages will catch up with those in Western Europe. But this catch-up cannot happen overnight'it should go hand in hand with productivity increases in manufacturing. If wages rise by over 20 percent annually'as happened in Bulgaria and the Baltics during the boom'competitiveness will deteriorate quickly, and many investors may think twice before they start building a new export plant. **Finding the right niche** That's not to say that Emerging Europe should compete on low wage costs only. Not only will be it hard to compete against countries such as China which are also active in this segment; emigration to Western Europe will also make it difficult to keep wages low for very long. Instead, the region should aim to move up the quality ladder, and produce increasingly sophisticated products. Here, structural reforms could help, including those that bolster the business climate. In addition, improving education and'in some countries'combating corruption will also assist. **Still a role for foreign capital** Foreign capital inflows can play an important role as well. Not capital inflows that boost demand, but capital inflows that boost supply. Foreign direct investment in the external trade-oriented sector is particularly helpful, as it will not only boost growth, but also transfer technology and contribute to an improvement of labor force skills. Some countries in the region have already been following this growth model. In the Czech and Slovak Republics, growth during the boom was much more balanced than in the other countries. The credit boom was much less severe, current account deficits remained small, and exports were as important to growth as domestic demand. During the boom years, it looked like this growth strategy did not produce growth that was as strong as in the countries with strong domestic demand booms. But the recession has been much less deep, and seen over a longer time period, these two countries have actually grown faster than the countries that relied on the nontradable sector. **Note:** _This is part of a series of posts by Marek Belka, Director of the IMF's European Department and a former Polish Prime Minister, on the situation in Europe as it emerges from the worst economic crisis in more than 60 years._ Other posts include: ## [Getting Ready to Join the Eurozone Club ## [After the Crisis, Much Still at Stake for Eurozone [Unwinding Crisis Policies in Europe: Are We There Yet?

But being in the European Monetary Union (EMU) hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for all its members.** On the contrary, as I argued in [my blog posted January 21, the crisis has highlighted that sound policy frameworks are more important than ever. Let's look at this experience from the perspective of the European Union's new member states in the East, who are still outside the EMU but are set to join sooner or later. Should they accelerate or delay their applications? And what are the conditions for success, once they have gained entry? **Fixers and floaters** The answer to the first question depends in large part on the currency regime. For small and very open countries with fixed exchange rates'the three Baltic republics and Bulgaria'there is really no alternative to seeking EMU membership as fast as possible. They have been particularly hard hit by the crisis, partly because of their currency regime; in fact, [Latvia had to rely on massive external support to pull through the crisis. But they all have managed to hold on to their long-standing currency pegs against the euro. Once in EMU, their economic policy frameworks would remain virtually unchanged. At the same time, euro adoption would remove residual currency and liquidity risks, which during the recent crisis have driven up borrowing costs, dented investor and consumer confidence, and contributed to their sharp output contractions. So for the peggers, joining the club is all gain and no (additional) pain. The picture is less clear cut in the larger new member states, who on the whole have been served well by their flexible exchange rate regimes. During the boom years, currency appreciation and monetary tightening helped prevent overheating, and their recent downturn was relatively muted. Some, notably Poland, benefited from a temporary boost to exports as their currency depreciated during the crisis. But when foreign capital inflows suddenly dried up in the wake of the Lehman bankruptcy, several of the floaters found themselves short of euro liquidity needed to supply banks, households, and enterprises indebted in foreign currency. To fill this funding gap, [Romania and [Hungary drew on balance of payments support from the IMF and the European Union; [Poland, too, topped up its available foreign currency resources with the IMF's new Flexible Credit Line. These extraordinary actions helped stabilize the situation. But the unpleasant experience of sudden euro shortages and currency volatility will weigh on policymakers' minds as they decide how quickly to move toward euro adoption. **The euro is for the agile** More fundamentally, however, potential new applicants should ask themselves: are we ready for life in the eurozone? Here I don't mean meeting Maastricht criteria, which in any event are ill suited to assess rapidly converging economies (as many observers, including [myself, have pointed out over the years). Rather, what I have in mind is a more profound question: are institutions and society as a whole prepared to make the adjustments'painful at times'that continue to be necessary once the country has stepped on board the EMU? In particular, what is the political feasibility of fiscal and structural reforms of the kind now required of EMU member countries like Greece and Ireland? If anything, the crisis has confirmed that the euro is for the agile, as aptly observed by [Alan Ahearne and Jean Pisani-Ferri already in 2006. While there are differences between countries, the new member states on the whole do not score badly on this account. Over the past years, they have proven nimble in adjusting their trade and production structures to new opportunities, and they have become increasingly integrated both with EMU members and other new member states; productivity levels have increased; job markets are flexible; and labor mobility, including across borders, is high. But what I find most impressive, especially in the fixed exchange rate countries, is the ability to maintain fiscal discipline and take tough adjustment measures when needed. Take Estonia, which is hoping to introduce the euro in January 2011. Despite losing almost one-fifth of its output, it has kept its public deficit below the required 3 percent of GDP. As documented in the [IMF's recent Article IV report, this reflects swift adjustment when the crisis hit, sound institutions and, importantly, prudent policies during the boom years. Having been at the helm of government myself, I can appreciate how truly remarkable this accomplishment is. Policymakers in the West, who are often struggling to push through relatively modest changes to entitlement and subsidy programs, may wonder how their Baltic colleagues have been able to pass tax hikes and spending cuts worth some 10 percent of GDP in a single year without prompting mass protests on the streets. Let's not forget that economic and political pain is a relative concept. People in Eastern Europe, having only recently gone through the wrenching experience of transition from planned to market economy, know that there is a price to pay to preserve stability and sustainability. Nowhere is this insight stronger than in the Baltics. Of course, not all new member states share such determination, instilled by running a currency board for almost two decades. Policymakers need to do more to explain that euro adoption is not a goal in itself and that sacrifices will need to be made to fully reap its benefits. For whether pegger or floater, a country's ability to adjust in the face of new challenges is the true test of whether it is fit for life in the eurozone.

I lived through an earthquake when I was a young boy in Morocco, and I know how harrowing it is. At that time, there were forty thousand casualties'nothing close to what has happened in Haiti'but I still recall the traumatic scenes of collapsed buildings and mourning families. Haiti has now been devastated on a far larger scale. The earthquake'the worst in the region in more than 200 years'is the latest in a series of natural and manmade disasters that have, over the years, turned the Caribbean country into the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. Some 80 percent of its nine million people live below the poverty line. The earthquake has flattened much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. According to the International Red Cross, three million people, nearly a third of Haiti's population, will need emergency food, water, and shelter for months to come. [ Survivors of the earthquake in Haiti shelter in tents in the capital, Port-au- Prince (photo: AFP) Two hundred years ago, Haiti was the 'Pearl of the Antilles.'\u009d Its amazingly rich soil then produced four crops a year. It is not unrealistic to imagine that the country can be rebuilt as a prosperous nation. But it needs help over a prolonged period. That's why [I'm proposing a type of Marshall Plan'an international effort to support the Haitian authorities in rebuilding the country and back its democracy, much as the United States helped rebuild Europe after the destruction of World War II. The IMF has the capacity to provide urgently needed cash resources very quickly, and we'along with separate contributions from other international agencies'aim to make $100 million available to Haiti in the next few days as a bridge that will get Haiti through from today's humanitarian needs to tomorrow's reconstruction. The Fund, in close coordination with other donors, is assisting the authorities in getting cash to circulate in the economy so people can buy food, and civil servants can be paid. Banks will reopen shortly but the payments system is not fully operational yet. That will take care of short-term needs but we should also plan now for the future. A first donors' conference is scheduled to take place in Montreal next week, in preparation for a larger conference in the spring that will mobilize financing for Haiti. I hope the contours of such a plan will start to take shape through the process begun in Montreal. In the coming weeks and months, the Fund will participate, by providing money and expertise, in the reconstruction plan that will be coordinated across the international community. Part of the goal will be to restart private activity, rebuilding businesses and encouraging guarantees for the banking sector so that lending can get under way again. It is also critical to support the creation of jobs in rural areas, where large sectors of the population have moved because of the quake. With victims still being dug out of the rubble, Haiti's needs are massive and immediate: the international community is working together to mobilize all available resources and to deliver them as quickly as possible. Once again, in tragic circumstances, the rescue and reconstruction effort highlights that only the international community, acting in concert, can meet challenges that go beyond individual governments. And we must emphasize that the focus on Haiti must not result in the diversion of aid at the expense of other poor countries. For now, and for at least the next couple of years, [Haiti has no payments to make on its existing debts to the Fund, while the emergency loan we are providing is interest-free, with no repayments due for five years. Looking beyond the emergency phase, and as part of an international plan to rebuild the country, there will be a need to reassess Haiti's debt situation in light of the catastrophic damage to its economy. At that stage, the international community needs to be ready to provide comprehensive debt relief. Today, the urgent immediate priority is to save the people of Haiti. In a few weeks, it will be reconstruction. We must be prepared to think on as massive a scale as then U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall did after World War II. If we seize this chance, we can help the people of Haiti escape their cycle of poverty and deprivation fuelled by merciless natural disasters that plague the Caribbean nation.

That anniversary fell in the midst of the worst global financial crisis in the past half century. The euro'and the European Central Bank'proved important safeguards against the spread of the crisis. Countries whose currencies would likely have been subject to severe market gyrations had they not been part of the eurozone held their ground. And the ECB used innovative approaches, along with central banks around the world, to help provide liquidity and calm markets. But as the crisis progressed, it became clear that the eurozone countries were affected in very different ways. Markets took notice and the premia charged on sovereign bonds diverged. This month, as the euro turns 11 and even as the crisis is receding and an economic recovery is underway, prominent commentators'including [Martin Wolf and [Paul Krugman'are concerned that the strains within the eurozone are serious, and will need serious attention. **** **Divergences within the eurozone** The problem is clear. As we all know, the global economy enjoyed an unprecedented expansion just before the crisis hit, which saw countries within the eurozone growing at widely different rates, with diverging inflation rates. [Calculations by the OECD show that applying the so-called Taylor Rule to individual countries would have implied very different interest rates in the different countries. Underlying the divergence in economic performance were a variety of factors operating in varying combinations: rapid growth in property prices, insufficient supervision of financial sectors, and long-standing structural weaknesses. Markets tended to ignore these differences and risk premia on sovereign bonds were remarkably small and stable through to the start of the crisis in July 2007. Presumably, the view was that the internal mechanisms of correction, through national and European policy measures, would bring the eurozone economies back into alignment. But once the crisis hit, the differences in countries' projected public debt levels, the state of their financial sectors, and their overall competitiveness made the presumption of self-correction increasingly tenuous. Today, while the spreads are off their peak levels, as my colleagues [Ashoka Mody, and separately [Silvia Sgherri and Edda Zoli, have pointed out in recent papers, market differentiation has clearly increased and is likely to stay.**** **Tackling regional imbalances__** Looking ahead, then, what are the policy challenges? Clearly, the scope for changes in monetary policy is limited. The monetary policy framework has worked well and is regarded as credible. Changes on the margin are, in any case, not likely to influence the major underlying source of the problem: differences in country policies and structures. Some important changes are already in train. The lessons learned from the crisis have led to an emerging global consensus on how best to regulate and supervise financial systems. The European Union is closely involved in this debate and is committed to instituting more stringent financial policies across its member countries. Within the EU's single financial market, a system of cross-border arrangements is needed to assess and manage systemic risks. I am encouraged that an [EU Financial Stability framework is emerging. This is a key initiative. As Paul Krugman has pointed out, even in the United States, a national crisis is felt with varying force in different parts of the country. But two important features of the U.S. economy mitigate these inevitable regional imbalances. First, the movement of people from weaker to stronger economic regions promotes adjustment over the medium term. Second, federal fiscal transfers help reduce the distress of depressed regions. In Europe, labor mobility has increased over time'and has been important in some countries, such as Ireland and Spain'but it remains limited even as trade and capital move seamlessly across borders. Portability of pensions and healthcare are among the structural policy measures that could encourage labor mobility. But important barriers remain. Federal fiscal transfers do not really exist in the European Union, but the combination of large automatic stabilizers attuned to country-specific circumstances and borrowing in a single currency should mimic them to some extent, provided overall fiscal discipline is preserved. As such, a central premise of European policy'embodied in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)'has been that national fiscal discipline will discourage imbalances from emerging in the first place. Today, just when the challenge of realigning countries' economic prospects is greatest, the challenge of restoring fiscal discipline is also unprecedented. With eurozone economies shrinking in 2009 and the crucial need to inject fiscal stimulus, deficits have increased and public debt is headed higher for a number of years. The SGP provides the benchmarks to which countries must return'a deficit less than 3 percent of GDP and a public debt-to-GDP ratio less than 60 percent. But underlying these targets is the SGP's goal of a close-to-structural balance in each country. These targets will present a huge challenge. No doubt, an unreasonable pace of consolidation may do more harm than good. But the flexibility that the SGP likely will be forced to accommodate may call its credibility into question. **** **Developing a broader framework for fiscal governance** To be fair, the SGP was not designed to deal with fiscal challenges of a large common shock in the context of constraints on the effectiveness of monetary policy or with individual euro area members running into financing difficulties. In my mind, this raises the key question of whether the euro area needs a broader framework for fiscal governance. One idea, healthy for its own sake, would be for individual countries to credibly commit to fiscal self discipline by adopting, for example, fiscal targets and supporting institutions that create momentum in favor of fiscal restraint. But recent experience has also shown that the tendency to shade the fiscal numbers produces rude surprises. A more vigorous effort at the European level to monitor these numbers in a consistent and preemptive manner is therefore essential. In addition to the stronger preventive surveillance that is possible now that the Lisbon treaty is in effect, other aspects of a broader framework for fiscal governance could also be explored. For example access to central resources, either from common bond issuance or increased federal transfers, could be introduced and conditioned on good behavior. **Much is at stake** The ECB has established a sound monetary framework and has proven itself responsive to the enormous challenge we have recently faced. The relatively benign global economic conditions in the euro's first decade helped allay concerns about divergent economic performance within the eurozone. That reprieve no longer exists. The ECB and the European Union are in the process of establishing new institutions and rules to create a stronger Europe. The success of these efforts will determine Europe's course and the role of the euro in its next decade and beyond. Much is at stake.

This is something that IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has repeatedly [emphasized. **Exiting too early may jeopardize the recovery. But [exiting too late may sow the seeds for the next crisis, as Wolfgang Munchau and others have argued recently. I also agree with Jean Pisani-Ferry and his colleagues that [exiting in an uncoordinated fashion will lead to a renewed build up of financial instability. To successfully unwind the extraordinary policy measures taken in response to the crisis, we need more than just a good sense of the state of the economic recovery and the degree of financial stability. We also need to know to what extent the global economy currently is influenced by those supportive policy measures. Is it safe yet to change course? **Continued macroeconomic support ** We are no longer at the edge of the abyss that loomed in early 2009, with all but a handful of Europe's economies now pulling out of recession. But it is less clear that we have reached safe ground: * Financial market participants do not seem to be able to make up their mind about the scenario we are in: equity valuations anticipate a solid and durable recovery, yet investors are willing to meet governments' extraordinary financing needs at very low interest rates as if growth prospects were poor. * Bank lending, crucial for Europe's smaller and medium sized enterprises, remains tight, but capital markets are very active in funding larger corporations. * Unemployment is still rising but consumers appear to be '[believing in inflation again'\u009d, which is helping dispel lingering worries over deflation. * The euro is close to a historic high in real effective terms, and tensions in the euro area from divergences in economic performance and policy implementation have risen. I will return to this issue in depth in my next blog. This ambivalence can perhaps be attributed to the fact that extraordinary policy support, not just in Europe but also globally, impairs our ability to read the underlying economic fundamentals. The crisis has been very deep, and is likely to require economic restructuring and widespread balance sheet repair-processes that necessarily take time. Taking these factors together, I believe that it is important for fiscal and monetary policies to continue to support the recovery. While a rebound is under way, the recovery is still fragile, subject to important downside risks, and [uneven across the continent. We plan to publish revised growth forecasts at the end of January in the next quarterly update of the [_World Economic Outlook_. **Cautious switch from systemic to specific financial intervention ** With so many policy measures shoring up the financial system, it is hard to get an accurate read of its pulse and see whether it is stable enough to leave the emergency room. Yet equally important is the concern about these supportive policies turning into an addiction. So, where are we? There is ground for guarded optimism. As ECB Vice-President Lucas Papademos noted when presenting the ECB's [Financial Stability Review, confidence and resilience in financial markets has improved and remaining problems appear to be no longer systemic. But I also share his view that vulnerabilities are still high. Will banks be able to sustain the recent increase in profitability? Will they succumb to concentrations in lending to commercial property or emerging markets? And how would they handle a sharp increase in sovereign yields if fears about fiscal sustainability became widespread? Still, on balance, the time seems to have come to begin to progressively unwind some of the financial sector support measures. Technically, such unwinding is made easy because most of Europe's supportive measures have built in sunset clauses (most enhanced credit support measures), provisions linked to market conditions (for instance, debt guarantees), or costs that become more onerous as time progresses (for instance, recapitalization schemes). I would encourage policymakers to remove financial system supports in line with their built-in expiration dates. Indeed, the ECB has started doing this by ending its one year liquidity support measures and some countries have allowed debt guarantee schemes to lapse. The policy priority, instead, is to tackle remaining weaknesses with specific interventions. **Next: financial sector reform and credible fiscal consolidation** As IMF First Deputy Managing Director [John Lipsky pointed out two weeks ago, we should not forget the need for fundamental reforms in the financial sector. Europe has seized the crisis as an opportunity to put in place new pan-European financial stability arrangements. It now needs to play its part in implementing global regulatory reform. Clarifying quickly what the new rules will be would allow financial institutions to focus on their core business: provide credit where credit is due. The crisis has also exposed the weak underlying state of public finances in Europe. While a strong fiscal policy response to the crisis was necessary, I worry about the surge in government indebtedness and the potential for an adverse shift in sentiment about fiscal sustainability. To avert this, countries need to demonstrate credible plans for fiscal consolidation. Yet while Europe's finance ministers tabled [ambitious intentions, guided by the Stability and Growth Pact, translating these promises into credible plans has become more urgent than is generally perceived. Some of these issues are particularly pertinent for the euro area. I plan to blog on this next. ------------------ See also [Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Vi\u00c3?als on [Exit Strategy and [Unwinding Public Interventions in the Financial Sector.

In response, the G-20' a grouping that includes both advanced and large emerging economies'has stepped forward as the premier political venue for addressing economic and financial policy challenges. These changes are exerting significant influence on the evolution of global governance, and they directly involve the IMF in two concrete ways. First, new advances are taking place in multilateral economic policy cooperation, with Fund participation. Second, realignment of Fund governance has been put on a fast track, with delivery scheduled for January 2011. A striking initiative adopted by the G-20 Leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit was the promulgation of a **_Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth_**, and the creation of a _mutual assessment process_ to [implement the **_Framework_**. The Framework process represents an innovative means of preserving the unprecedented policy collaboration that developed over the past year as the crisis unfolded. Underpinning the Framework** **initiative is the generally shared conviction that the unprecedented strength and coherence of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy measures implemented after September 2008 was critical in arresting and eventually reversing the 2008/2009 global recession. **Multilateral dialogue** At the heart of the Framework** **process is the sharing of members' medium- term policy plans and outlooks in a format that will promote an effective multilateral dialogue. The overarching goal is the development of a coherent set of economic policies that will best support strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. The initial target is to prepare a detailed issues and options report for the November 2010 Leaders' Summit in Korea. The IMF has been asked to play a key supporting role in the Framework process. The Fund is helping to combine the G-20 members' economic forecasts and policy plans in order to highlight global prospects and potential challenges. In addition, Fund staff will provide analytical support to the G-20 authorities' examination of the likely impact of potential policy initiatives. Moreover, the Fund is helping to incorporate the inputs from other international organizations and institutions into the Framework deliberations. In 2006/2007, the IMF convened the 'Multilateral Consultations on Global Imbalances'\u009d with the particiation of China, the Euro area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The goal was to develop a set of economic policies that would benefit each individual participant, as well as promote the mutual goals of sustaining global growth while reducing international payment imbalances. In fact, the set of individual policy undertakings offered by each of the participants, and that were presented at the Fund's International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) [meeting in April 2007, were widely viewed as appropriate. However, the exercise failied to bring about sufficient concrete policy action by members to avoid the building crisis. Perhaps the Consultations were viewed as a Fund-conceived and Fund-led initiative, and the participants may have felt insufficient commitment to the effort's success. Of course, even though it was agreed that the policy plans were in each participant's interest, that didn't mean that the policy actions were politically popular. **Policy collaboration** Hopefully, one positive outcome of the crisis may prove to be that the value of economic policy collaboration has been demonstrated clearly. Thus, the potential benefits from the Framework** **approach may seem more convincing than was the case in 2007. Moreover, the Framework process reflects an unprecedented commitment from the political leaders of the G-20 countries, representing about 90 percent of global GNP and two-thirds of the world's population. Turning to IMF Governance, the IMFC, meeting at the Fund's [October 2009 Annual Meetings in Istanbul, endorsed the G-20 proposal to shift quota shares toward dynamic emerging market and developing countries by at least 5 percent by shifting shares from over-represented to under-represented countries. This move is to be in addition to the changes agreed under the [2008 Quota and Voice Reforms. The 14th General Quota Review is under way, and is expected to be completed by January 2011 (two years earlier than the formal deadline). The Review will consider two broad issues'the overall adequacy of Fund quotas and the distribution of quotas. Success in this effort will represent a milestone in the reform of IMF governance, as it would eliminate any significant misalignment in quota shares relative to measures of relative economic weight. This will go a long way to eliminating the basis for disputing the legitimacy of the Fund's decision- making process. This should enhance the IMF's effectiveness, for example in helping to represent the views of the nearly 170 Fund member countries that are not a member of the G-20. The review of the overall size of the Fund's quotas should better align the Fund's resources with the tasks facing the institution. The effort required to contain the financial crisis has been instructive. In this context, the Fund already is examining its prospective role, with a focus on how it can help to strengthen systemic stability. The success of the Fund's innovative [Flexible Credit Line has demonstrated the relevance of precautionary, insurance-like facilities, and the Fund is studying how it might further improve its crisis-prevention capability. Moreover, the Fund intends to improve its focus on multilateral and financial sector surveillance, with the goal of bolstering its contribution to systemic stability.

Nonetheless, important tradeoffs will have to be addressed'and political hurdles surmounted'before significant progress can be achieved. In particular, restoring economic growth will require renewed credit flows, while some of the needed reforms may limit the ability of financial institutions to meet this need, at least in the near term. And looking beyond the next few quarters, policymakers will have to balance the need for a dynamic and innovative financial sector with the objective of managing risk and reducing the likelihood of systemic crises. **Risk of slippage** In my [Jackson Hole blogs last August, I singled out reforming [financial sector regulation as a key task facing policymakers. This remains true today, but there is a risk that it will slip down the list of priorities as growth engines are starting up again and financial conditions have improved. After all, reforming financial regulation is politically difficult, and no doubt some will worry that it could complicate efforts to get credit flowing again. In addition, there is still a lot of anger directed against those institutions viewed as responsible for the crisis in the first place, especially since many of these same institutions received taxpayer funding in order to resist the crisis. In some countries, policymakers are responding by enacting one-off taxes on financial sector bonuses. However, no one'including the proponents of these measures'considers them to be a substitute for the more fundamental reforms needed to help avoid future crises. **Key principles** In fact, there is broad agreement on the key principles of financial sector reform. * First, the perimeter of regulation needs to be widened to encompass all systemically important institutions. * Second, macro-prudential elements need to be added to existing regulation, which today focuses almost exclusively on individual instruments and institutions. * Third, (and this is already in train), regulatory standards on capital and liquidity must be strengthened to better reflect firm risk exposures and risk profiles. Almost certainly, this will imply increased capital buffers and new limits on risk-taking. * Finally, a robust resolution regime is required for large, complex financial institutions that operate in multiple jurisdictions. In making the reform effort operational, the [Financial Stability Board (FSB) will take the leading role in coordinating the development of new global standards for regulation and supervision. These standards subsequently will be adopted and implemented at the national level. The IMF's unique role is to conduct independent monitoring of the implementation of the agreed standards. **Strengthened supervision** While the need for enhancing regulation has received much of the attention, bolstering supervision also is critical. Even today, notable risk management deficiencies persist in many important financial institutions. Improving the performance of supervisory authorities means increasing the resources devoted to this task, and providing the backing needed to make sure that supervisory recommendations are taken seriously. Of course, bank boards play a key role in setting and monitoring risk management standards, and in many cases, their oversight function needs to be sharpened. The design of compensation schemes also is relevant, and the FSB already has promulgated standards that will help reduce concerns that compensation schemes are promoting excessive risk-taking. Beyond regulation and supervisory reforms, the question remains, 'Who should bear the cost of crisis mitigation?'\u009d **Burden sharing** It is natural to ask whether the financial sector itself should shoulder at least some of the burden, both as an incentive to reduce the risk of future crises, and for reasons of fairness. The G-20 Leaders, in their [Pittsburgh Summit Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, asked the IMF to investigate how the financial sector could make 'a fair and substantial'\u009d contribution to paying for government interventions to repair the system, and we anticipate providing leaders with an options paper at their June Summit. The issue of burden sharing is complex and contentious, but'despite the widespread practice of paying for deposit insurance through a banking levy'up to now that question has received little systematic attention. And discussions that have taken place recently have tended not to focus on the potentially important tradeoffs involved in designing a sound regulatory system. As part of that debate, governments must face the challenge of balancing the need for more constraining regulation that limits the cost of future crises against the need to promote effective financial intermediation. An important element in that debate is whether taxes applied to more risky financial activities'either directly or indirectly' could be designed to reinforce or possibly substitute, to some extent, for stricter regulation. The public debate also seems to be divided about the purpose of a new financial sector charge or tax. For example, the issue of whether and how to recoup the costs of the net support _already _provided in the current crisis would lead to a different set of policy options than the issue of whether and how to create a mechanism to cope with potential _future_ costs. Both issues are relevant and related, but they need to be analyzed independently. Perhaps most notably, there has been widespread public discussion about the advisability of a tax on financial transactions. This is sometimes referred to as a 'Tobin tax,'\u009d reflecting an early 1970s proposal by the late Nobel laureate James Tobin. However, Tobin's specific proposal was restricted only to foreign exchange transactions, and was intended to suppress transactions, not raise revenue. While some of the current supporters of a financial transactions tax intend it in Tobin's sense, others have extolled such a tax as a potential source of earmarked revenues for a variety of purposes. The IMF's analysis will cover the issues and options broadly. These options, including'but not limited to'a financial transactions tax, will be evaluated in terms of their potential to reduce distortions and improve systemic efficiency and effectiveness. The pros and cons of creating a fund in advance of future crises also will be addressed. This analysis will be supported by an evaluation of more technical issues such as the definition of systemically important institutions, the perimeter for the supervised financial sector and implementation of any regulatory changes needed to support financial stability. See also my[ interview with _IMF Survey_ online. In short, the entire reform effort won't be either quick or easy, but the potential payoff could be significant in terms of underpinning long-term growth, and enhancing systemic stability. Actual implementation will require sustained cooperation and focus. Improved [global governance'including of the IMF'will aid this effort, and this will be the subject of the next piece in this series.

The improved prospects are evident in economic data, in financial market performance, and in the marking up of economic forecasts. In fact, somewhat more upbeat expectations no doubt will be reflected in the regular January update of the IMF's _[World Economic Outloook_ forecast. [ Advanced economy output far below potential, still-cautious businesses and households, plus sluggish loan growth add up to a notable absence of inflation pressures (IMF photo) In more normal times, the degree of optimism about near-term growth prospects in the advanced economies would be much more intense than at present. For example, U.S. firms reacted to the downturn with aggressive layoffs and unprecedented cutbacks in investment and inventories. In fact, U.S. business investments didn't even match depreciation during the past two years. As a result, recent improvements in U.S. final sales are boosting both profitability and internally generated funds. Typically, these are key early- cycle building blocks for accelerating growth. **Reasons for caution** But these are not normal times, and the reasons for caution about the outlook remain powerful, pointing to a relatively modest recovery in the advanced economies. High unemployment rates in many cases'coupled with anemic income growth'are limiting consumption gains. Weakened household balance sheets add to the uncertainty about spending prospects. Financial conditions have improved, but in many ways they remain far from normal. Credit losses are still mounting in some sectors, especially commercial real estate. The combination of advanced economy output that is far below potential, the still-cautious attitudes of businesses and households, plus sluggish loan growth reflecting bankers' residual reticence, together add up to a notable absence of inflation pressures. In turn, the combination of large output gaps, low inflation and the prospect of only a moderate advanced economy recovery underscore the Fund's contention that it is premature to begin withdrawing the important support for growth currently being supplied by accommodative budgetary and monetary policies. On the more positive side of the balance, the growth outlook remains upbeat in many emerging market economies, especially in Asia. In most cases, this reflects improving export demand plus resilient domestic demand, the latter in many cases buoyed by significant policy support. With the specter receding of a sustained advanced economy downturn, and with global interest rates low, capital once again is flowing strongly to the best- performing emerging markets, reversing the sudden stop experienced in later 2008. **At least five challenges** Looking forward, the new decade is ushering in a series of at least five key challenges. The first is to **secure the recovery, by ensuring that policies among the key economies remain appropriately supportive of the expansion, as well as globally consistent**. In particular, advanced economy fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented fully, even while countries lay out credible medium-term frameworks for limiting spending and debt to sustainable levels. Moving beyond the next several quarters, ensuring a robust global economy will require new growth patterns, including significant rebalancing of the sources of growth among and within most large economies. The task of establishing the necessary foundations for restored global growth will fall in part to the policies followed by the G-20 countries. The new mutual assessment process agreed at the [Pittsburgh Leaders Summit, is intended to do just that'in effect providing the practical implementation of the G-20's [Framework for Strong, Sustained and Balanced Growth. The IMF is helping to provide analytical support for this innovative approach to multilateral cooperation. A second challenge is to **protect the poorest and most vulnerable from the impact of the downturn** and to restore growth in low income countries. During 2003'06, [sub-Saharan Africa achieved the fastest sustained expansion since the IMF was created, adding to per capita incomes. While raising and sustaining growth in advanced economies would make a substantial contribution to the low income countries' growth prospects, the expanded direct support provided through various initiatives'including the Fund's new facilities for low-income countries and sharply increased resources for lending'are intended to provide important additional support. **Financial sector reform** The third challenge is the **reform of the financial sector, with the triple goals of making the sector more effective, of reducing the risks of future instability, and to rethink how the potential costs of financial crises might be borne**. This is the subject of my next blog. The fourth challenge is that of **restructuring and reforming the governance and mandate of the key international financial institutions**. The creation of the G-20 leaders process was a potentially pivotal step in this regard. The leaders, in turn, have endorsed some specific goals for the IMF's governance reform. That will be the subject of my third offering in this series. There is a fifth challenge, and it will be the source of intense debate in the coming quarters'perhaps years. The economic success of the Great Moderation of the 1980s and 1990s encouraged policymakers and scholars alike to think that the prevailing framework of rule-based policies would prove to be durable. However, the crisis has called into question not just institutions, but also the intellectual underpinnings for prevailing views regarding economic and financial policies. Already, the Fund is helping to frame and contribute to the intellectual and empirical reassessment that is inevitable and even necessary. In the coming months, we will be contributing original research as well as sponsoring conferences and symposia in an effort to **distill the lessons of the crisis, and to help form a new policy consensus**. One potentially important aspect of this effort will be to devise new lending instruments that'building on the 2009 innovation of the [Flexible Credit Line'will allow the Fund to play a larger role as a provider of insurance to our members, and enhancing our ability to help prevent future crises.

What hit us, and what was the tossing and turning all about?** The popular simile is a comparison with the Great Depression, as in 'This is the worst downturn since the 1930s.'\u009d In fact, unless we get hit with another hammer before we fully wake up, the Great Recession is very unlike what the world went through some seven decades earlier. The [Great Depression, like the recent collapse, began with a banking crisis, but of a different kind. Instead of emanating from huge financial institutions in major money markets, the earlier one spread outward from small midwestern banks in the United States and led eventually to a near total loss of confidence. Depositors pulled their money out into cash or gold, and the U.S. banking system shut down. Investors in other countries also moved heavily into 'safe'\u009d assets. [ Cars in line at U.S. gas station in 1979: the world in which consumption could flourish amid cheap and readily available energy was gone forever (photo: R. Krubner/ClassicStock/Corbis) Exchange rates became unstable, and international trade began to break down. Then, instead of putting a coordinated stimulus in place, governments and central banks flailed about with little understanding of how to stabilize the economy, and with no institutional structure for coordinating economic policies. The result was a decade of stagnation and loss, of deflation, unemployment, and depression in every sense of the word. Today, the future is not that bleak. **Compared with the 1970s** A better comparison is with the 1970s: not because the origins are similar, but because the consequences may be. That decade began with worries about the overvalued dollar, as the U.S. economy overheated. The whole system of fixed exchange rates soon unraveled, and that trauma was followed quickly by the arrival of a global power shift toward oil exporters. The value of the dollar was dropping, the price of oil was soaring, and an unwanted and ugly new word'stagflation'entered our vocabulary. The consequence of the shocks of 1973'74 was that we could 'not go home again.'\u009d The world of the 1960s, in which trade could flourish in the comfort of price and exchange stability, and consumption could flourish in the comfort of cheap and readily available energy, was gone forever. The challenge was not to find a way back to those comforts. The challenge was to find ways to live in a very different world. The quest took several years, and it did not entirely succeed. Much like our recent and not quite finished nightmare, the world economy went through two years of serious recession while policymakers and their economic advisers tried to absorb the new reality and devise plans to adjust and reform. Some countries put in place fiscal stimulus policies to combat unemployment, while others tightened monetary policies to combat the inflationary effects of the shift in the global oil market. The major industrial countries then tried to organize a coordinated effort to designate the stronger countries as locomotives for recovery. **Roadmap for recovery** The OECD's 1977 [McCracken Report and the G-7's 1978 summit meeting in Bonn laid out a roadmap for recovery. It was based primarily on a stimulus to be led by Germany, which was thought to have the most room for maneuver to increase government spending and raise economic growth. That judgment turned out to be far too optimistic. More inflation and a second upsurge in oil prices were the main results. Not until a U.S.-led anti-inflation effort finally took hold did a real recovery get under way. Even then, the emerging markets of [Latin America were left behind, as the need to adjust quickly to higher interest rates and a strengthening dollar undermined their economic systems. **Save more** Now, as then, we cannot go home again. The [Great Recession has destroyed the possibility of consuming and investing on cheap and easily available credit without regard to quality. Households in major industrial countries will have to borrow less and save more than they did before the crisis. At the moment, interest rates are extremely low while central banks try to offset the withdrawal of credit from financial institutions, but when rates return to normal levels the new reality of expensive credit will register fully. Moreover, the world economy may have to absorb this shock at the same time that governments begin to withdraw fiscal stimulus. The history of the 1970s warns us not be overly ambitious in trying to reflate economic activity as the crisis recedes. The boom times that we have lived through are not the norm, and they have not been sustainable. We are not doomed to repeat history, but reaching a new path to a more lasting prosperity is likely to take a major effort and much patience.

The IMF's Legal Department has the lead on the Fund's work in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and our work includes assessments of countries' compliance with the international standard on [anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), technical assistance, research, and policy development.

We think the macroeconomic impact is potentially highest in countries where * Criminal activities occur on a large-enough scale to adversely affect the economy (for example, Eastern European pyramid schemes in the mid-1990s or kleptocratic regimes that weaken government finances) or a macroeconomically significant sector (for example, financial sector frauds that cause runs on banks); * Transactions in illegal markets are responsible for a high percentage of measured output (for example, an economy driven in large part by narcotics production and trafficking), or * Weak AML/CFT regimes jeopardize a country's access to global financial markets due to countermeasures and sanctions (as can happen when [the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issues a public statement on a country's lack of compliance with international AML/CFT standards). Such circumstances are frequently correlated with general weaknesses of governance, transparency, and oversight. Of course, macroeconomic impacts can be experienced in the member country, but because money laundering is an international phenomenon, its macroeconomic impact can also manifest itself as an externality for other members. **Financial frauds** The criminal activities that most commonly generate significant sums for laundering are large-scale financial frauds (for example, the Enron, Parmalat, and Madoff scandals), corruption (such as the regimes of the Philippines' President Marcos and Zaire's President Mobutu), tax evasion, and narcotics production and trafficking. It seems to us beyond dispute that these large-scale criminal activities'though difficult to measure'can and do significantly influence the external stability of some Fund members. To the extent that these phenomena have the potential to influence'or actually do influence'stability, it makes sense for the Fund to include AML/CFT more formally in its regular surveillance work. Similarly, analysis of money laundering risk should inform the prioritization, depth, and frequency of AML/CFT compliance assessments in FSAPs, especially in light of the response of the Group of Twenty (G-20) to the financial crisis, which includes proposals to enhance controls on money laundering and terrorist financing without a corresponding increase in resources. **Improving understanding** Of course, we realize that economic analysis of money laundering is a difficult and sensitive area. But we believe that we can help improve understanding of illegal underground and criminal markets, and that this will help us assess and design effective AML/CFT frameworks. As we develop an analytical framework for understanding risk from money laundering, we are testing it with colleagues who specialize in AML/CFT, as well as with economists working on more traditional concerns of the Fund. Authorities from countries in South America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa have expressed interest in continuing to work with us in this direction. We hope that this kind of collaboration will help generate better statistics, and ultimately improve collective understanding of aspects of the economies of Fund members that may have escaped scrutiny through traditional macroeconomic analysis. _Jody Myers is Assistant General Counsel in the IMF's Legal Department._ ", "index": 743}, {"pub": "12/10/2009", "title": "Unwinding Public Interventions in the Financial Sector", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=988", "content": " By [Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Vi\u00c3?als **The IMF held a high-level [conference last week on unwinding public interventions in the_ _financial sector.** Insightful discussions took place among policymakers, academics, and the private sector, highlighting several areas where a broad consensus appears to be emerging, as well as some challenges that policymakers are about to face.** ** **Converging views** There was broad agreement that an exit strategy**_ _**from monetary, fiscal, and financial sector interventions**_ _**is essential.**_ _**The pivotal goal of this exit process would be to arrive at a condition of price stability, fiscal sustainability, and financial stability, including a new financial landscape that is much safer than currently exists.

That said, tailoring the strategy will likely be more an art rather than a science because of the uncertainties and the need to have firm assurances that it will not undermine recovery. **Diverging views** Views differed regarding the timing of the exit process. Some participants argued that it was better to exit earlier because of possible fiscal policy lags and/or potential new asset bubbles. Others argued it was too early to exit given that global economy prospects still remain highly uncertain.

There was also no clear consensus regarding the sequencing of an exit strategy.**_ _**Some felt that fiscal adjustment should take place first to ensure easier exit from monetary policy measures. Others argued this may not be feasible because the political process of unwinding fiscal interventions would likely be long and complicated and hence monetary policy accommodation should be unwound first. **_ _** **Some principles for exit strategy** Exit strategies need to be consistent at three levels. First, there needs to be consistency between monetary, fiscal, and financial policies in each country. Second, exit plans from different financial sector interventions need to be consistent. Third, individual country policies should be internationally consistent to avoid undesirable spillover effects, including from advanced to emerging market economies. Further, economic and financial indicators should guide the exit strategy. These indicators should include quantity, as well as price signals'in particular, developments in the aggregate and sectoral credit variables. **Main challenges ahead _ _** There are many challenges that lie ahead.

And in some cases, the financial institutions in distress were not even particularly big; rather, they were too interconnected, and too important for the functioning of the global financial system, to be allowed to fail. We need to think about how to deal with such 'too-_important_-to-fail'\u009d institutions for at least three reasons. * When institutions are provided with implicit (and explicit) public support, they are apt to take on riskier activities than they otherwise would, with the knowledge that the government will step in if those risks turn out badly. This is called **moral hazard**. * Well-run institutions are forced to compete with institutions that are implicitly guaranteed'or even directly financially supported'by the government. This makes for an **unlevel playing field** in the financial sector. * Government support **absorbs valuable public resources**, arguably at the expense of more equitable and productive public spending; it could also endanger the fiscal stability of a country. [ When institutions are provided with implicit (and explicit) public support, they are apt to take on riskier activities than they otherwise would (photo: Newscom) Consequently, the G-20 leaders asked the [Financial Stability Board to propose measures, by October 2010, to resolve the problems created by institutions that are 'too important to fail.'\u009d In the interim, we are contributing to the exercise, providing input on the various proposals under consideration. **Prevention and resolution** In my view, there are essentially two complementary approaches to reducing the systemic risks posed by too-important-to-fail institutions: attempting to **prevent **systemic financial sector failures before they happen, and constructing a framework to **resolve** failed financial institutions in a way that minimizes disruption to the financial system once a failure occurs (i.e., resolution frameworks). There are many proposals in the area of **prevention,** including mandating higher capital, provisioning, and liquidity buffers; instituting various types of charges or taxes on institutions for their contribution to systemwide risks; using contingent capital instruments; improving risk management and accounting systems; splitting up institutions into smaller entities to mitigate systemic failures; and encouraging them to voluntarily desist from risky behavior that affects others. In principle, economists are more comfortable attempting to influence the incentives faced by financial institutions rather than using administrative/legal or other means of splitting up various businesses. In practice, good incentive-based regulation is difficult to design and implement effectively, though it is still considered by many economists to be the 'first-best'\u009d approach. In the area of **resolution frameworks,** much could be done. Requiring financial firms to prepare a 'living will'\u009d might be a good start. Living wills identify how institutions would unwind their activities in the case of their own demise. Also, a special resolution regime applied only to banks and certain types of regulated nonbank financial institutions would allow a failing financial firm, which is taken over by the government, to continue to function as an intermediary while it is dismantled or sold in part or whole to new owners. At the IMF, we are investigating the pros and cons of the various proposals and coming up with some of our own. I hope this generates a productive discussion about this key issue, which has important implications for all taxpayers, consumers of financial services, and beneficiaries of a well- functioning financial system.

On top of this, international institutions like the IMF [enhanced their lending facilities to help emerging markets and developing economies better cope with the threats posed by the crisis. [ There are now signs of recovery in a number of the major advanced economies most affected by the crisis (photo: John Sommers/Reuters) The good news is that these measures were broadly successful: the threat of a 1930s-style Depression was averted. There are now signs of recovery in a number of the major advanced economies most affected by the crisis, while emerging market economies are growing more strongly. That said, the financial system and the economic recovery are still fragile. Most policymakers are taking pains to avoid withdrawing support too early, a mistake that is widely seen as having prolonged the downturn in the 1930s. Nonetheless, it is not too early to begin planning for an eventual exit from extraordinary interventions. A carefully thought out and collaborative approach will be extremely important. The ultimate goal of the 'exit'\u009d process would be to converge to a situation of price stability, sustainable public finances, and the restoration of market discipline in a safer financial sector. This will provide the necessary conditions for stable, strong, and sustained economic growth. In practice, this means several things: removing the degree of monetary accommodation introduced through low interest rates and the credit and quantitative easing policies of central banks; pursuing a vigorous policy of fiscal consolidation to bring public debt back to reasonable levels; and withdrawing the measures now in place to support the financial sector, while introducing the necessary reforms to make it safer. In this policy response, two things are particularly challenging: reducing public deficits and debt levels sufficiently; and achieving a consistent exit process across countries. **Weak public finances** The weakened state of public finances in the big advanced economies'the United States, Japan, much of Europe'will require vigorous policy action. Population aging meant that the fiscal situation in these countries was already extremely challenging before the crisis, and higher fiscal deficits in response to the crisis have added to the problem. Even though it is too early to withdraw fiscal stimulus, countries must develop and communicate [a clear plan for reining in public deficits and public debt, to be implemented as soon as the economy is on a sufficiently sound footing. A consistent international approach to exit will be essential to contain the risk of destabilizing spillover effects. Especially among those economies whose financial markets are closely linked, withdrawing financial guarantees or tightening regulation in an uncoordinated way could trigger sharp movements in international financial flows that could disrupt the recovery and undermine credibility. The IMF is actively involved in helping prepare the groundwork for a sound exit. In early November, we proposed to the G-20 high-level principles to help guide policies during the exit process. We are also convening [a conference of senior officials and financial market participants in Washington on December 3 to discuss key issues in unwinding crisis interventions in the financial sector. And, as requested by our membership, we are taking steps to ensure that policymakers across the world are fully informed about what is planned or occurring elsewhere, and are provided with up-to-date analysis on the possible policy spillovers.

What are the reasons for this? And what made some financial institutions with similar business models, and in the same country, better equipped to deal with the virulence of the crisis? **To find the answers, we need to ask the following question: How well did the four key components of a sound financial system'good regulation, effective supervision, robust risk management, and credible resolution mechanisms'perform? A lot of attention has been paid to improving regulation, the_ _**first key component**. Sweeping changes are being proposed through new and enhanced rules of the game, such as higher capital, loan loss provisions, liquidity buffers, and limits on executive compensation. I believe that corresponding changes are also needed in the other three components if a crisis of this magnitude is to be avoided in the future. [ Comprehensive approach to resolution will have preventive elements such as requiring derivatives to be traded through centralized counterparties (photo: Chris Hondros/Getty Images) The **second key component **is the quality of financial sector supervision. Supervisors monitor both how well regulations are implemented and the quality of internal risk management systems in regulated firms. If deemed inadequate by the supervisors, firms must be required to take corrective action. For this to work, supervisors need clear mandates, operational independence underscored by public accountability, adequate resources, and first-hand knowledge of their firms. Their approach must include a sufficient degree of on-site and off-site work. In addition to firm-specific vulnerabilities, they should also capture systemic risks'distinguishing the forest from the trees. They must have the authority to bring about a wide range of remedial actions. These actions should be primarily rule based, so that supervisors can withstand pressures to 'forbear,'\u009d but the rules should also allow for the exercise of supervisory judgment. The **third key component,** risk management systems in financial institutions, should identify emerging vulnerabilities. Supervisors should test the quality of these systems and provide guidance on how they expect risks to be managed. They have to follow up by periodically drilling deep into the firm's risk management functions to test their effectiveness. Even with these systems in place, the primary responsibility for ensuring robust risk management systems rests with the boards of directors of financial institutions, which are the foundation of firms' internal defense mechanism. The board should determine the risk appetite of the firm, nurture the appropriate risk culture with internal incentives, and assure that the firm does not take on excessive risk'a role that many boards have not played well in this crisis. **Orderly breakup** The **fourth key component_ _**is the resolution mechanism to deal with nonviable firms, particularly those that are deemed systemically important and insolvent. A comprehensive approach to resolution will have several elements. The first would be a '\u009dpreventive'\u009d element that ensures a more robust infrastructure, such as requiring derivatives to be traded through centralized counterparties to limit the consequences of financial institution failures. A second element would be the requirement by systemically important institutions to develop a plan for an orderly breakup and dismantling of group structures. This is called a \"living will.\" A third element would be a '\u009dspecial resolution regime'\u009d applicable to regulated institutions whose failure could have systemic implications. These elements become even more important when systemically important institutions have a cross-border presence. Harmonizing resolution internationally could well be the last bastion to fall in this battle. In my view, the policy agenda needs to target each of these four key components if a balanced outcome is to be achieved. If any one of the four is weak, then the foundation on which the global financial system stands becomes inherently unstable. While much of the emphasis so far has been on improving regulation, I am convinced that we need to be mindful of the other three components to keep instability at bay.

I've summarized here some of these themes along with their implications for future research. **_1\\. _****_Household leverage played a critical role in shaping the dynamics during the current U.S. recession. _**[The first paper of the conference provided convincing evidence that the U.S. counties where household leverage had grown the most during the boom were also the ones that experienced the largest busts as measured by home prices, defaults, auto sales, and unemployment. Future research should focus on the policy implications of these findings, especially in the context of the role of monetary policy in mitigating the adverse effects of asset bubbles.**_ _** **_ _** [ U.S. counties where household leverage had grown the most during the boom were also the ones that experienced the largest busts (photo: Aurelia Ventura/La Opinion) 2\\. **_New insurance mechanisms are needed for the prevention of , and responses to, financial crises. _**[The Mundell-Fleming lecture by Ricardo Caballero (MIT) drew a striking parallel between a sudden cardiac arrest and a financial crisis. The best option during a sudden cardiac arrest is to [use a defibrillator. Ricardo argued that, using the analogy between the two events, we need to have 'financial defibrillators'\u009d readily available during financial crises as well. It is beyond the scope of this blog to discuss the pros and cons of the clever insurance mechanism Ricardo designed, but it is obvious that we need to undertake more research to develop alternative mechanisms and clearly articulate their practical implications. **_3\\. _****_Balance sheet adjustment has come with reallocation of assets across financial players. _**[One of the conference papers focused on the buying and selling of asset-backed securities during the current recession. It reported that sectors dependent on repo financing, including hedge funds and broker dealers, reduced their holdings of such securities, while the commercial banking sector increased during the past two years. While acknowledging the imprecise nature of these findings, the paper argues that government financing helped commercial banks absorb asset-backed securities. The greater message of the paper is that it is necessary to delve deeper into the details of the data in order to undertake a rigorous analysis of balance sheet adjustment. We need more of this type of research in order to have a better grasp of balance sheet adjustment over the business cycle. **__** **_4\\. _****_Global banking flows play a critical role in the spread of the crisis. _**[Another paper showed how large banks, both in the United States and elsewhere, had created and sold short-term asset backed securities worth more than one trillion dollars, and used the proceeds to invest in longer term assets. When the crisis came, these banks had to adjust, and this adjustment process determined how the crisis spread around the world. Global banks, not global imbalances, the paper concludes, are what led to the rapid spread of the crisis. **__** **_5\\. _****_Debt overhang can have major macroeconomic effects. _**One of the conference papers presented a [nice theoretical analysis of the interactions between debt overhang problems in the household and banking sectors. If households are underwater, consumption and saving decisions are no longer efficient. If banks are underwater, financing of new investments dwindles. The interactions between these can amplify shocks and prolong downturns. The paper argues that government bailouts of financial institutions can improve economic efficiency, but as the discussion of the paper makes it clear we now need more than ever good quality research about the policy implications of debt overhang. **__** **_6\\. _****_There are two-way linkages between the dynamics of financial intermediaries' balance sheets and fluctuations in asset prices._** [Another conference paper explained how financial intermediaries' balance sheet management can amplify asset price movements. Balance sheet positions of intermediaries determine their risk appetite, which in turn affects the supply of credit. Although monetary policy can influence the supply of credit through its impact on financial intermediaries' balance sheets, our knowledge about the quantitative implications of different policy actions through this channel for the real economy is still in its infancy. **__** The conference also featured lively debates about the effectiveness of various policy interventions that took place during the crisis. These debates were a part of a broader discussion, triggered by the financial crisis, among economists about of the state of macroeconomic research over the past year. The climax of these debates took place at the [concluding session of the conference, which featured an [Economic Forum on** '**Macro-Financial Policies After the Crisis.'\u009d As the Managing Director observed in [his opening speech, one of the most important lessons we learned from the crisis is that we need to have a much better understanding of macro-financial linkages. This requires us to undertake rigorous, policy relevant research in both academia and research institutions around the world. This year's Annual Research Conference provided an excellent collection of research papers serving exactly this purpose.

But low-income countries have been badly hit too, reflecting their growing integration in the world economy.** We can see sharp declines in exports, FDI, tourism, and remittances. Output growth in 2009 will be less than half of the pre-crisis rate of over 5 percent. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected, with a contraction of real per capita GDP of almost 1 percent. This is the bad news. But there is some good news in all of this. Low-income countries have been able to use fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool this time around, far more than in the past. Fiscal deficits are expected to increase in three-quarters of low-income countries in 2009, with an [average expansion of 3 percent of GDP. Revenues have grown slower than GDP, reflecting the disproportionate impact of the crisis on trade and commodity revenues, as well as weakening tax compliance. Expenditures are expected to increase by about 2 percentage points of GDP. [ The crisis has also confirmed the importance of debt relief and donor assistance in creating fiscal space, and in supporting the fight against poverty (photo: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters) Almost one-third of the low-income countries are augmenting their automatic fiscal loosening with a discretionary stimulus, mostly through current spending. Many low-income countries have sought to preserve or increase social spending, and IMF-supported programs have shown flexibility by allowing automatic stabilizers to work and by accommodating fiscal stimulus. **Room for larger deficits** The fiscal easing has been more prevalent in countries with low or moderate risk of debt distress prior to the crisis. The combination of debt relief and sound policies led to falling debt ratios before the crisis, providing room to accomodate larger deficits during the crisis. We can see this in both [Central America and [sub-Saharan Africa. Countries with higher risks of debt distress had more limited room to expand deficits because of financing constraints'and many of these countries tightened fiscal policy by cutting non-social spending. This experience confirms the importance of following prudent fiscal policies in good times, to be able to use fiscal policy to cushion shocks in bad times. And so, as the global economy recovers, countries will need to rebuild their fiscal space. The crisis has also confirmed the importance of debt relief and donor assistance in creating fiscal space, and in supporting the fight against poverty. But major donor countries now face [large deficits and rising debt of their own. In these circumstances, they could scale back support to low-income countries, in spite of Gleneagles commitments to double aid to sub-Saharan Africa. Continued support to low-income countries must remain a priority. These countries still face daunting social and infrastructure challenges. Some still have elevated risks of debt distress that predate the crisis'I'm thinking here of countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tajikistan, or Togo. Let's face it'support to low-income countries is still a small fraction of total spending in advanced countries (a mere 1 percent of expenditures, on average). While the advanced countries will need to tighten fiscal policy in the future, cutting funds for aid would cause severe harm to low-income countries, without making a significant difference to their own fiscal problems. At the same time, the onus is on low-income countries to continue improving the way foreign aid is spent, through strengthening public financial management, fighting corruption, and better prioritizing expenditure.

The science of the issue can get pretty incomprehensible pretty quickly.** And the politics are clearly very ugly. Let's not forget, however, that much of the economics is simple. **It's an externality, stupid'so price it** Climate change is an 'externality'\u009d problem. Individuals, firms, and, yes, governments, do not take full account of the harm that others suffer when they emit greenhouse gases. So they emit too much. And the best way to stop them doing this is to charge them a price for the carbon content of what they emit: a 'carbon price.'\u009d Admittedly, climate change is a particularly complicated externality. Since the damage will fall largely on future generations, the proper price depends very much on how we value their well-being relative to ours. The importance of such long-lived investments as power-stations, and the heavy sunk costs of investing in new technologies, mean that the carbon prices people expect in the future are even more important than the price now. And the fact that the world's supply of fossil fuels is ultimately fixed means that the effect of carbon prices on total emissions is not as clear cut as it may seem. [ Emission reductions solely by those countries historically responsible for the accumulated stock of emissions will not come close to solving the climate problem (photo: Newscom) But the basic principle remains'polluters should pay (these and other points made here are elaborated on in an IMF paper on the [fiscal implications of climate change). **How much? How? Who?** Not surprisingly, views on the best path of carbon prices differ. But the numbers are often strikingly moderate. Even $60 per ton of carbon'somewhat higher than current prices in the EU emissions trading market,and a fairly realistic starting value for proposed schemes in the United States'would mean only $8 per barrel of oil, hardly noticeable relative to the swings we've become used to. Of course, the point is that this would not be just another swing. It would be permanent. The carbon price would also increase over time, and apply not only to oil but also (importantly) to coal and (ideally) to emissions from deforestation and agriculture. What is underappreciated in the public debate is that the initial steps need not be very scary. Moreover, many countries continue to underprice or even subsidize gasoline, which is almost always found to be a [hugely expensive handout to the relatively affluent. There are several ways to implement a carbon price'tax carbon emissions, issue a fixed quantity of emission rights that can be bought and sold ('cap and trade'\u009d) or a bit of both. There are pros and cons of each. For example, rights are all too often given away for free ('grandfathered'\u009d) dissipating a source of revenue that could help address the alarming [fiscal challenges ahead. What matters most for the climate is that something effective is actually done. Another key piece of the economics is that the [collective costs of reducing emissions are much lower when more countries participate. Here we run up against perhaps the most inconvenient truth of all'emission reductions solely by those countries historically responsible for the accumulated stock of emissions will not come close to solving the climate problem. But the basic economics of externalities tells us that we should be able to find a way of dealing with them such that everyone benefits'by, for instance, a clever allocation of emissions rights across countries. **Balancing the fiscal** There are certainly important developments under way toward carbon pricing. What worries me is the lack of serious debate on such key issues as their proper level, how to compensate those who might genuinely suffer from their imposition, how to ensure efficient linkages between national schemes, and (though I hope my views on this one are clear!) the pros and cons of grandfathering. No doubt there's reluctance to talk about raising energy prices at the present time of macroeconomic weakness. But the need for a clear, credible, and broad- based carbon pricing strategy is urgent. There is a risk that, in addressing climate change, we get the balance between tax and spending measures seriously wrong, playing down the role of taxation. Our fiscal problems will become even worse if we use spending measures to make up for failures to properly price carbon.

What accounts for this dramatic increase? Income growth, insurance, demographics, and technological change all contributed, but the latter was the key driver. Public spending for health care also increased sharply (by 5\u00c2? percentage points of GDP) during this period (see Figure 2). [ [ What about the future? The impact of demographics is reasonably easy to predict, and aging, by itself, will not cause health spending to explode. Other demand-side variables'including such risk factors as obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure'are harder to assess, but should also be manageable. The real uncertainty is technological change. In principle, technical advances could lower costs. But in practice, as in the past, they could expand the limits'and potentially the cost'of what health care can achieve. Different countries make different assumptions about the effects of technological change. In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes a large impact from technological change: Total health spending is projected to grow at an annual rate that is about 1\u00c2? percentage points higher than the GDP growth rate through 2060. This would cause total health spending in the United States to increase by more than 15 percentage points of GDP over this period, with an increase of 10 percentage points of GDP in public spending (this projection does not take into account possible effects of the health reform proposals currently under discussion). In contrast, the European Commission (EC) [Aging Report baseline projections'used by EU members for their long-run fiscal projections'are much more optimistic. These projections assume that per capita spending at older ages will _decline _in the future, implicitly assuming that technological change will reduce spending. This leads to a relatively low projected increase in public spending (1\u00c2? percentage points of GDP by 2060'less than one-sixth of what is projected for the United States). But this conflicts with the experience of the last decades. What I would regard as a more realistic scenario is presented in one of the Appendices to the Aging Report: this scenario (see Table 67) involves an increase in public spending of 6\u00c2? percentage points by 2060. Even this would assume a moderation of health care spending growth with respect to the past. So what does this all mean for government budgets? The different assumptions between the two sides of the Atlantic can give the impression that the U.S. budget is much more exposed than European budgets to pressures from health- care costs. While lower public spending growth is likely in Europe'especially since public spending in the United States focuses on the elderly'Europe will also likely face major spending pressures from the health care sector. So what about the benefits of health spending? [Research has shown that increases in health spending in the 20th century produced tremendous gains. Technological innovations have reduced the (quality- adjusted) price of medical treatments, including those related to the most important causes of mortality. And new drugs and medical procedures have been developed to treat previously untreatable conditions. Further advances could improve the length and quality of human life. But we will also need policies that allow us to reap the benefits of technological change without sacrificing fiscal sustainability.

But fiscal deficits cannot be lowered in the immediate future. For the time being, fiscal (and monetary) policies must continue to support economic activity. The economic recovery is uneven and could be threatened by any premature withdrawal of policy support. Private demand is still unable to stand on its own two feet. This gives rise to a policy conundrum. How can we reconcile the competing requirements of short-term support for the economy and longer term fiscal solvency? **Fiscal solvency strategies** The challenge for policymakers is to formulate strategies for fiscal solvency'what we often call 'exit strategies'\u009d'and communicate these strategies to the general public. The G-20 countries recognized this requirement in their recent [communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. This will be important, but words may not be sufficient. Are there actions that governments can undertake today to enhance their credibility without negatively affecting aggregate demand? Yes, there are. [ Studies say increasing retirement age in European Union by two years could save equivalent of 40 percent of GDP in net present value terms (photo: Johannes Eisele/AFP) First, governments can reform their institutional fiscal framework to make it more likely that fiscal adjustment takes place when the time for action arrives. The precise framework will depend on country-specific circumstances. Possible reform options include fiscal responsibility laws, numerical fiscal rules (to take effect only when conditions normalize), fiscal councils tasked with monitoring fiscal developments, improvements in budgetary procedures, and increased fiscal transparency. The example of Germany is worth noting. In June, the German parliament adopted a new constitutional fiscal rule that limits the structural deficit of the federation to 0.35 percent of GDP from 2016 onward and requires structurally balanced budgets in the states from 2020. **Health, pension reforms** Second, various reforms in health and pension entitlements, though politically not easy, can be undertaken without jeopardizing economic recovery. These reforms will not have a large impact on the today's deficit, but can dramatically improve long-term fiscal trends and signal commitment to fiscal sustainability. They will not undermine demand if well structured'with a focus, say, on increasing the retirement age'or if they are passed now but implemented gradually. These reforms can have powerful effects. For example, it is estimated that increasing the retirement age in European Union countries by two years can save the equivalent of some 40 percent of GDP (in net present value terms). In sum, postponing fiscal tightening does not mean postponing fiscal action.

Gross general government debt in the G-20 advanced economies is projected to approach 120 percent of GDP by 2014, up from about 80 percent in 2007, and this is even assuming no renewal of fiscal stimulus beyond 2010. Some might think that this comes from an 'exotic'\u009d form of fiscal policy whereby governments opened their coffers to prop up financial institutions. But only a small part of this debt spike is matched by a rise in financial assets. It really boils down to 'plain vanilla'\u009d deficits'revenue losses from the recession, fiscal stimulus, and some underlying spending increases that would have occurred even without a recession. #### A first step Pretty much everybody agrees that something has to be done about this, and that fiscal policy needs to be tightened once the economic recovery has firmly established. The first step is to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. Even this will not be easy, given trend increases in pension and health spending, often reflecting population aging. But is stabilizing debt ratios at their post-crisis level enough? The temptation will be strong. Just look at the numbers. Let's assume that advanced countries want to reduce gross debt to 60 percent of GDP (the median pre-crisis level) by 2030. To do this, they will need to improve their structural primary balance by 8 percentage points of GDP over the next decade, and keep it there for another decade. Obviously, this is a tall order. Simply stabilizing debt at its post-crisis level means half the work'an adjustment of 4\u00c2? percent. This is still ambitious, but much more manageable. #### Easy path not the best Still, taking the easy path is not the best idea. Governments need to do whatever they can to lower debt ratios, for at least three reasons. * First, they need space for fiscal responses to possible future crises. If you start with high debt, it's really hard to let fiscal policy cushion the shock'just look at Italy. * Second, high debt pushes up real interest rates, with pressure on a limited pool of private savings. We have [computed that raising government debt ratios by 40 percentage points (exactly what is projected to happen on current trends) would increase real interest rates by a sizable 2 percentage points. This may even be an underestimation as it is based on backward-looking estimates from a world where only a few countries were running high debt ratios, which could partly be financed abroad. With so many large economies borrowing at the same time, the effect on interest rates may be larger. * Third, high-debt countries tend to grow more slowly'just look at Japan and Italy. While other factors were certainly at play, the experience of several emerging market countries confirms the existence of debt overhang effects. Altogether, I believe that living with 100 percent government debt ratios is not a good idea. Fiscal exit strategies in advanced countries should target a reduction of government debt to prudent levels. If a debt ratio not exceeding 60 percent'as noted, the pre-crisis median level'was regarded by many countries as an appropriate norm before the crisis, it should continue to appear so after the crisis. And while it is too early to tighten fiscal policy today, the plans should certainly be put in motion.

First he's in Singapore attending the 16th [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers' Meeting, and then goes on to China November 16-17, one of the region's most dynamic economies. In Singapore, the Managing Director co-chairs a roundtable discussion on economic policy challenges facing the region and will deliver a lecture on the role of Asia in reshaping the post-crisis global economy. In China, he will discuss with the authorities their policy response to the global crisis and ask senior government officials about their outlook for the Chinese and world economies. The visit is another sign of the importance which the IMF attaches to its relationship with Asia as the region leads the world away from crisis toward global recovery. It will also provide Asia and the IMF an opportunity to deepen their engagement. Asia has contributed much to the global recovery and contributed significant financial resources to the Fund to help it assist other members to cope with the crisis. * First, as highlighted in the October 2009 _[Asia and Pacific Regional Economic Outlook_, that was recently launched in Seoul and Tokyo, the powerful stimulus measures that many countries took to counteract the crisis have helped the region lead the global recovery. * There is growing recognition in many countries for the need to reorient the drivers of medium term growth. As Premier Wen Jiaobao recently indicated, China has 'made vigorous efforts to stimulate consumption and make domestic demand, particularly consumer spending, the primary driver of economic growth'\u009d. The Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Heng Swee Keat, recently took the view that 'to sustain growth, Asian economies with big domestic markets will need to continue with structural reforms to boost domestic demand'\u00a6. Measures to encourage new investments in the corporate sector and in public infrastructure, as well as in education and healthcare, will be necessary for most Asian emerging economies in order to realize their growth potential'\u009d. Greater reliance on domestic sources of growth will, in time, offset weak export demand from advanced economies at the center of the crisis. * Asian countries have played a critical and catalytic role in boosting the IMF's resources. In the early days of the crisis, [Japan provided $100 billion to bolster the IMF's lendable resources during the economic crisis. This commitment' the single-largest supplemental financing contribution by an IMF member country'has helped catalyze other contributions to the Fund and reflects Japan's continuing global economic leadership. Through the [New Arrangement to Borrow and Note Purchase Agreements, Asia has raised its contribution to the Fund by $178 billion, including a pledge of $ 50 billion from China, $10 billion each from India and Korea, and $2 billion from Singapore. * More recently, the Reserve Bank of India paid [$6.7 billion for 200 metric tons of gold from the IMF'about half the total sales volume of 403.3 metric tons that was [approved by the IMF's Executive Board in September 2009. This transaction will help toward putting the Fund's finances on a sound long-term footing and, by helping the Fund finance its subsidy account, enable it to significantly increase concessional lending to the poorest countries. The IMF, for its part, has continued to expand ways to hear views from the region. A notable development will be the inaugural meeting later this week in Singapore of a new, advisory group of eminent representatives from across Asia who will be hosted by the Managing Director. The Fund will seek the views of this group on the economic issues facing Asia and how the IMF can best help in meeting those challenges. Indeed, we are already adapting to meet the needs of our Asian members. * Take the example of the IMF's global role through the lens of one of its key responsibilities: [surveillance. Using the knowledge we garner from our near-universal membership, we have brought more of a cross-country perspective to our analysis, both within and outside our region during this critical period of global financial crisis when timely information on what other policymakers were doing was critical. This has given regional policymakers access to a wider global perspective and the thinking of economic teams across the world. This improvement has already been acknowledged by some Asian voices, such as Singapore's Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam [see [YouTube video below]. * In addition, the IMF has redesigned its [lending facilities to better match the conditions in borrowing countries. For example, we extended an exceptional access loan to [Mongolia earlier this year, and so averted a potential balance of payments crises that would have demanded disastrous cuts in social services In contrast, that country's financial markets have now stabilized, capital outflows have been reversed, and inflation has fallen. Through all these different channels, Asia is rising to meet the responsibilities of its growing economic weight and that trend is clearly illustrated in its closer and stronger relationship with the IMF.

Let's imagine for a moment you are an investor'you may well be' you put quite a bit of money into a company to back its expansion plans. Initially, these plans prove successful, and the company makes quite a bit of money. But then the firm ran out of investment ideas. What would you expect them to do? Surely, you would expect them to return the money you provided, for example by paying it out as dividends. But in the past, prosperous decade before the current downturn this hasn't been happening in emerging Asia. Firms have been sitting on their profits, not investing them, but not paying them out in dividends, either. That is a puzzle, and a problem. It's a puzzle because it's not obvious why firms should sit on money when they don't have any need for it. When firms initially started doing this after the Asian crisis of the late-1990s, they had a ready rationale. They wanted to pay down their excessive levels of debt, which during the crisis had brought some of Asia's largest companies low. But as the years went on, and debts fell, first to safe and then to low levels, it was clear that something else must be going on. There's a further puzzling aspect. Economic theory states that households can 'pierce the corporate veil'\u009d and extract value from a company even if it doesn't actually pay out profits as dividends. That's because the retained earnings would increase the firm's net worth, which would be reflected in its share price. Households could then sell the shares, or borrow against them. Either way, they could spend more. This theory has been tested in empirical research and found to hold in advanced countries, and some emerging markets. But it doesn't hold true in China or the rest of emerging Asia. Households simply do not consume more, despite holding valuable financial assets. Why does this matter? It matters because Asia's corporate savings puzzle lies at the heart of its economic imbalances. It is precisely the substantial and growing excess of savings over investment in the corporate sector, coupled with subdued household consumption, that over the past decade has produced the region's large external current account surpluses. We tried to analyze this mystery in Chapter III of the_ [Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook_. We discovered two vital clues: * _**Corporate governance.**_ The higher the level governance, the more shareholders are able to exercise their rights and prevent firms from hoarding cash. * _**Financial sector development**._ The more liberalized the financial market, the less firms hoard cash, because they have easier access to funding and are less worried about being shut out of financial markets. Financial liberalization also allows households to consume against their corporate wealth, because they can borrow using their financial assets as collateral. These finding have profound implications for policy. For example, the econometric estimates imply that if Asia were to reach the average level of corporate governance in advanced economies, it would be able to lessen corporate savings by as much as 2\u00c2? percent of GDP. Similar advances in financial sector liberalization could reduce savings by 5 percentage points. Resolving the conundrum of firms that save but do not invest, and households that hold this wealth but cannot consume may enable Asia to finally catalyze domestic demand. It could help to restore rapid growth, even in a 'new world'\u009d of softer advanced country demand. Improved corporate governance and further financial sector development may be two remedies worth exploring.

In the coming year, they will need to pull off a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, they need to continue providing extensive macroeconomic support to their economies until it is clear that the recoveries are sufficiently robust and sustainable. On the other hand, they have to make sure that stimulus is not maintained for so long that it ignites asset price bubbles, inflation pressures, or concerns about fiscal sustainability. Where policymakers strike this balance will depend on a prior assessment: they will need to decide whether private demand has become strong enough to substitute for a withdrawal of public sector demand. And if that isn't difficult enough, this assessment will need to be forward- looking, at a time when the economic outlook has become exceptionally uncertain. In figuring out how to pull off this delicate balancing act, the lessons of the past may prove instructive. So, Chapter II of the latest_ [Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific_, launched last week in Seoul and Tokyo, looks at the experience of Japan, when it emerged from its [1990s banking crisis. Here is what we concluded : * _**'Green shoots'\u009d do not guarantee a sustained recovery.**_ On two occasions, emerging recoveries allowed stimulus to be withdrawn. However, both times the external environment subsequently deteriorated dramatically, and the shock to the economy was magnified by a still-fragile financial system. A more severe downturn ensued, necessitating even more aggressive stimulus. * **_Sustained recoveries may not take hold until balance sheet problems at the heart of the crisis are addressed_.** A durable recovery took hold only after Japan's banks became more aggressive about dealing with problem loans and capital shortages; and corporations finally shed the 'triple excesses'\u009d of debt, capacity, and labor. * _**While this restructuring is under way, policy stimulus may need to be maintained.** _ * _**Policymakers need to clarify 'exit strategies.'\u009d** _ At an early stage, they should set out medium-term plans for fiscal consolidation and specify the conditions under which monetary accommodation will be withdrawn. These lessons can readily be applied to today's conditions. Notwithstanding the sprouting 'green shoots'\u009d, one needs to be cautious about the outlook. Private demand in advanced countries could remain weak for a prolonged period, until households reduce their debts to more normal levels and banks repair their balance sheets. Meanwhile, Asian domestic demand could also remain weak, since such spending typically revives only after exports start booming and associated incomes start flowing through the economy ' at least in the more export-oriented nations. This all adds up to continued stimulus for the time being. Of course, different countries are facing different situations. In particular, countries with large domestic markets, such as China and India have smaller output gaps, since they were not hit as hard by the crisis and have more advanced recoveries. So, they might need to tighten before some of their Asian neighbors. But most of Asia faces a different imperative. They may need to maintain policy stimulus for some time to come.

There are three pieces to the puzzle of Asia's rebound: * Exports (in value added terms) account on average for about one-third of GDP in emerging Asian countries, while many of the region's large firms depend on global capital markets to finance their investment projects. * Recovery in the rest of the world has been unsteady. * Yet Asia's own GDP figures for the third quarter have been impressive: Korea grew nearly 3 percent in that quarter alone, Singapore grew even faster, and China's growth accelerated to 9 percent year-on-year, propelled by booming investment. **** **The answer to the puzzle** How do these pieces fit together? One part of the answer is the powerful measures the region took to counteract the crisis. Soon after the global downturn hit, Asian authorities boosted government spending, reduced interest rates sharply, and provided liquidity to strapped financial markets. Construction workers in Korea. Across Asia the economy is rebounding. Their fiscal programs were, on average, even larger than those introduced by the Group of Twenty industrialized and emerging market countries. These measures have had a significant impact, boosting GDP by about 1\u00c2\u00be percentage points in the first half of the year. Another part of the answer is that in this business cycle, international trade has fluctuated far more than the GDP of advanced countries. As you can see in the chart below, global trade collapsed at the end of 2008 ' so output in Asia's export-oriented countries fell further than that of countries at the center of the crisis. But since February, trade has been normalizing rapidly, tracing out a pronounced V-shape, clearly visible on the graph. Unsurprising then that Asia's recovery is duplicating that V-shaped. **How do we sustain Asia's recovery?** So far, so good. But future recovery may prove more challenging. Over the coming quarters, the impetus from trade normalization will fade. Macroeconomic stimulus can continue to support growth for a while, but ultimately a self- sustaining recovery will require an improvement in private domestic demand, both external and domestic. As we say in the _REO_, global conditions are expected to continue to improve '\u00a6 slowly. According to the IMF's latest forecasts, output in the large G-7 economies will likely grow by just 1\u00c2? percent next year, recouping only half the contraction estimated for 2009, because private demand in these countries remains constrained by the legacy of the crisis. So overseas demand for Asia's products will remain subdued. This means the region's growth will remain well below the 6\u00c2\u00b2/3 percent average recorded over the past decade. The current crisis has proved the resilience of Asia's economy to the largest shock since the 1930s. But it also poses challenges including the need to nurture the recovery until it becomes self-sustaining, and how to return to rapid growth in a 'new world'\u009d of softer G-7 demand? I'll turn to these particular puzzles in subsequent blogs.

Fiscal policy is also playing a countercyclical role in a number of other countries in 2009. In contrast, some of the region's other commodity exporting countries'which in general had implemented a procyclical fiscal policy during the previous years of expansion'continue to do so in 2009, with negative fiscal impulses. And most of the LAC region's tourism intensive countries are also implementing a procyclical policy, again similar to their previous record. The different fiscal policy responses this year are not a surprise, but relate to differences in the conditions and policies prevailing in more favorable times. Countries implementing countercyclical fiscal policies in 2009 are those that have the ability to do so. This is the notion of _fiscal space_, related to the availability of financial buffers, and the ability to access international capital markets even during bad times, a privilege associated with stronger track records of fiscal discipline'including by having achieved larger fiscal surpluses in the pre- crisis period, when revenues were booming. Countries with larger debt ratios, lower debt ratings, lesser access to financing or their own financial buffers have less space to conduct countercyclical fiscal policies. In some cases, these restrictions are related to past patterns of rapidly increasing expenditure when rising commodity export prices deliver revenue windfalls. This year's experience highlights the value of strengthening fiscal policy frameworks in the future, so that all countries can be better prepared for future episodes of unfavorable conditions. ** **For a discussion of these policy issues, and a detailed analysis of policy responses to the global crisis, see the October 2009 edition of the _[Regional Economic Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean._ Other blogs in this series: [The Commodity Connection: Rising Commodity Prices and the Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean [Latin America and the Caribbean During the Global Crisis: Better than the Past, Better than Other Regions [Why Did Latin America Do Better in This Crisis?

But within that pattern, what is notable is that this time the recovery of global activity is uneven, with emerging Asian countries already taking the lead, while the most advanced economies are recovering more slowly. Because the former countries consume relatively more commodities, this uneven composition of global growth is a key reason for the recovery recently seen in commodity prices, and for thinking that this will continue. This pattern of commodity prices' being sensitive to the condition of Asian economies is not new: the crisis in East Asia in the late 1990s sent commodity prices down, even while the advanced economies maintained growth. And in the early 1990s, when advanced economies had a downturn that was not shared by other countries, commodity prices avoided a big decline. What does the recovery of commodity prices mean for economies of the region? Clearly it's not welcome from the point of view of countries that are net importers of commodities, including, for example, most countries of Central America and the Caribbean. Many of these economies are already at a disadvantage these days, given their reliance on income from remittances or foreign tourism'both flows are sensitive to employment conditions in the United States and other advanced economies, which are expected to recover only slowly (Figure 2). On the other hand, for net exporters of commodities'including the largest economies of the LAC region'the recovery of these prices is a piece of good luck. Still, these countries need to bear in mind that commodity prices are rarely stable and that their future path is always uncertain. The implication is that fiscal policy should respond cautiously when commodity prices trigger big gains in government revenue, saving rather than spending revenue gains that are seen as temporary. The eventual reward to such fiscal caution comes when times turn bad, and prudent governments find that they are able to implement countercyclical fiscal policies'this is the topic of our next blog post.

This allowed a number of countries of the region to implement countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies. Figure 1 shows a measure of the benefits that this better preparation has brought. It compares the fall in average growth of GDP actually observed in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (solid line) with our best estimate of the_ decline that would have occurred_ if their policy frameworks and vulnerabilities had not been changed (dashed line). The estimates here suggest that these countries were able to 'save'\u009d about 4 percentage points of GDP during the crisis, thanks to their better preparations for confronting external shocks. Figure 2 shows that various countries of the region had the room or 'space'\u009d to apply countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies during this crisis. The figure depicts changes in interest rates (vertical axis) and in fiscal deficits (horizontal axis) for each country of the LAC region, where the colors group countries according to certain general characteristics and the diameter of the circles represent the relative size of each economy. The countries with more credibility in the management of their monetary and fiscal policies were able to lower their interest rates and simultaneously to increase their public expenditure and fiscal deficits (these are the green circles, corresponding to Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). Key to this outcome was that these countries had saved part of their revenue gains during the 'bonanza'\u009d years of rising prices of their commodity exports. In our next note we will look at the differing impacts of commodity price developments on countries of the region. More details on these topics can be found in the October 2009 edition of Regional_ Economic Outlook: Latin America and the Caribbean_, available this Friday, October 23.

In fact, the performance of the region has been as good as, or better than, many other emerging market economies. This reflects, among other things, that the region avoided falling into an internal financial crisis of its own. The impact of the recession has been substantial, but following the contraction of output recorded in the first half of this year, the LAC region is recovering, and is expected to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. As Chart 1 shows, the region has had a better performance in this crisis than in the past. The chart compares the path of growth of the region's GDP with that of the world economy in several past episodes of world recession. In past crises, LAC growth fell much more than the world average (left panel). In the recent crisis, however, the region's growth has stayed in line with the world average (right panel). Chart 2 shows that the region's recent performance has been better than that of other emerging market economies. Since the beginning of the crisis, forecasts of 2009 growth have been marked down across the board, but for countries of the LAC region these markdowns in general have been much smaller than for other countries. A key difference was that in the LAC region, external shocks did not trigger internal financial crises, which in turn would have amplified the total impact of the external shocks on economic activity. It's important to analyze the reasons why the region had a better performance in this crisis-this will be the topic of the next blog.

Strategically located between East Asia and Europe, and South Asia and Russia, Central Asia is rich in resources and faces tremendous opportunities'yet to be made the most of. Since the outset of their transition to a market economy, the countries of the region have made visible progress toward decentralizing their economies, creating market institutions, expanding international links, and intensifying efforts to diversify and increase production and trade. As a result'and owing also to sound macroeconomic management, high commodity prices, and strong foreign inflows'this landlocked region, the size of the European Union and home to 60 million people, enjoyed near double-digit growth on average during 2001'07. Oil wells in Baku, Azerbaijan: With global energy demand increasing again, Central Asia's energy exporters should see growth rates increase in 2010 (photo: David Mdzinarishvili /Reuters) But, as elsewhere in the world, the global economic crisis has taken a toll on Central Asia, with average growth for the region as a whole sinking from 5.7 percent in 2008 to 1.2 percent in 2009. Nevertheless, this average masks important differences across countries. Two of the region's three energy exporters'Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan'have weathered the global downturn reasonably well, thanks to fairly limited linkages to international markets, long-term energy contracts, and supportive government policies. These countries are projected to register robust growth in 2009, supported mainly by public spending made possible by ample public savings accumulated during previous boom years. Kazakhstan, however, will be held back by the lingering effects of its banking crisis and is likely to see negative growth of around 2 percent in 2009. With global energy demand increasing again, the energy exporters should see growth rates increase in 2010. In contrast, for the two energy importers'the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan'facing deteriorating living standards largely as a result of a sharp drop in remittances from, and trade with, Russia; recovery in 2010 is projected to be slow and gradual. **Remarkable opportunities** The IMF's latest [outlook for Central Asia examines how, beyond short-term stabilization measures, the region has still to tap into remarkable opportunities. The area is richly endowed with natural resources (oil, gas, copper, gold, uranium, and hydropower) and a young and educated labor force. This economic potential can be developed more quickly with a strong and vibrant private sector operating in an effectively and transparently regulated business environment. To this end, governments in the region must continue to improve the business environment by reducing excessive bureaucracy, improving governance, developing infrastructure, and strengthening economic institutions. Moreover, to exploit this potential, Central Asian countries will need to cooperate regionally, as both markets and infrastructure projects often span frontiers. Addressing their political differences, particularly in the water and energy sectors, will be key to enhanced regional cooperation. Significant scope also remains for reaping the benefits of trade by liberalizing trade regimes.

Islamic banks were less affected during the initial phase of the crisis, reflecting a stronger first-round impact on conventional banks through mark- to-market valuations on securities in 2008. But, in 2009, data for the first half of the year indicate somewhat larger declines in profitability for Islamic banks, revealing the second-round effect of the crisis on the real economy, especially real estate. Going forward, Islamic banks overall are better poised to withstand additional stress, according to the [IMF analysis. ### Portfolio risk Islamic banks have grown substantially in recent years, with their assets currently estimated at close to $850 billion. Overall, the risk profile of Islamic banks is similar to conventional banks in that the risk profile of Shariah-compliant contracts is largely similar to that in conventional contracts, and credit risk is the main risk for both types of banks. Islamic banks are not permitted to have any direct exposure to financial derivatives or conventional financial institutions' securities'which were hit most during the global crisis (photo: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images) Unlike conventional banks, however, Islamic banks are not permitted to have any direct exposure to financial derivatives or conventional financial institutions' securities'which were hit most during the global crisis. An analysis of the top 50 banks in the GCC indicates that conventional banks also had this advantage going into the crisis'direct exposure to equity investments (and derivatives in the case of conventional banks) were very low in both types of banks (a mere 1 percent of total assets in conventional banks and 2 percent for Islamic banks in 2008). #### Risk concentration The main difference in risk exposures appears to be related to concentration risk of Islamic banks in certain countries. While Islamic banks' exposure to the risky real estate and construction sectors is lower in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain, it is significantly higher than the system's average in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Qatar. While Islamic banks were less affected by the initial impact of the global crisis, profitability fell substantially across both types of banks in 2008 and the first half of 2009, with declines somewhat larger for Islamic banks during the second phase. The weaker performance of Islamic banks in 2009 was largely driven by the U.A.E. and Qatar, where they had a considerably higher exposure to the real estate and construction sectors. A more complete view of the impact of the crisis on the two groups of banks will become available next year. ### Which group of banks is better positioned? With larger capital and liquidity buffers, Islamic banks are better positioned to withstand adverse market or credit shocks. On average, Islamic banks' capital adequacy ratio in the GCC is higher than that for conventional banks (except in the U.A.E.). The risk-sharing aspect of Shariah-compliant contracts adds to this buffer as banks are able to pass on losses to investors.

Despite the sharp drop in oil prices last year, the oil exporters rightly decided to maintain spending by drawing upon reserves amassed during the boom years. High public spending and exceptional anticrisis financial measures have not only cushioned oil exporters' own economies but are also contributing to sustaining global demand. They have also helped the interlinked economies of neighboring oil importers. **Facing this boom-bust cycle**** ** Between 2004 and 2008, Middle East oil-exporting countries grew by about 6 percent a year and accumulated $1.3 trillion in foreign assets. With the striking drop in oil prices'from a peak of $147 per barrel in mid-2008 to around $30 per barrel at the beginning of 2009'the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been hardest hit. Iraq and Saudi Arabia are expected to see the most pronounced drops in oil GDP growth'8 and 15 percentage points, respectively'this year. Despite sharp drop in oil prices last year, oil exporters rightly decided to maintain spending by drawing on reserves amassed during boom years (photo: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images) During the precrisis boom years, banks had lent substantial amounts for real estate and equity purchases and made large profits. With the onset of the crisis, asset values fell sharply and the global deleveraging led to a severe tightening of credit conditions, especially in the GCC. Banks' balance sheets have come under pressure credit growth has slowed sharply'up to 40 percentage points in Qatar. Now'that is, during this downturn'the foreign assets accumulated during the boom years are being used for countercyclical fiscal spending. Witness Saudi Arabia, which announced the largest fiscal stimulus package (as a share of GDP) among the G-20 for 2009'10, and a $400 billion investment plan over five years. Governments have also directly injected capital into stressed financial institutions and central banks have provided liquidity support to stabilize financial systems. These anticrisis measures have taken the sting out of the impact of the crisis. The non-oil sector is now projected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2009 (see the IMF's latest [outlook for the Middle East), with overall growth slowing only to 1.4 percent. Imports are being maintained at precrisis levels'at $700 billion in 2009'and helping the global economy weather the downturn. **Looking to the future** The flip side of continued public spending is that room for pursuing countercyclical policies falls if the crisis is prolonged. Some major oil exporters'like the GCC countries, Algeria, and Libya'have sufficient reserves to sustain spending over a longer period. Others'like Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Yemen'have less fiscal space and will need to prioritize or cut back government spending and subsidies. The banking systems have so far absorbed the stress and banks have remained solvent and profitable, although at a lower level. Deposit growth and capital inflows are beginning to regain strength, yet private sector credit has remained sluggish: instead, banks are opting to build up reserves in the central bank. Could the asset price bubble and excessive borrowing and lending by banks have been prevented? Given that the global outlook is improving and oil prices are rising again, what can be done to offset procyclical behavior on the part of banks? These questions are of particular importance for oil exporting countries since oil price swings are very large and, therefore, business cycles are particularly severe. Of course, not all oil exporting countries have had the same boom-bust experience, given that prudential measures and supervision were stronger in some countries than in others. One way to dampen the cyclicality of bank borrowing and lending would be to introduce dynamic loan loss provisioning'that is, to build up cushions during good times to be used during bad times. While this may cut into banks' profits, it could ensure continued lending during economic slumps and reduce the ultimate fiscal cost when tail risks materialize. Looking further ahead, there may be value in developing alternatives to bank financing, such as local private debt markets. This would allow banks to concentrate more on financing small and medium-size enterprises that create private sector jobs and help diversify economies.

But to many people, they were the main reason for making the trip to Istanbul. The program's October 4 offering included a first-hand perspective of how three emerging market countries'Turkey, Slovakia, and Ukraine'have weathered the crisis. We also got a glimpse of the methodology the IMF is using to become better at sounding the alarm if it sees new vulnerabilities building up in the world economy. ### More Europe, not less Ukraine was running a high fiscal deficit at the outset of the crisis, which made it vulnerable when the global economy came unstuck, Vice Prime Minister Hryhoriy Nemyria said. The lack of progress on structural reforms had reinforced the external shock, and had brought home just how dependent the country was on just one sector, steel, which accounts for 40 percent of all export earnings. Global economic crisis brought home how dependent Ukraine was on just one sector, steel, which accounts for 40 percent of all export earnings (photo: Viktor Korotayev/Reuters) Sounding hopeful that upcoming elections will bring more political stability to his country, Nemyria said he would hate to \"waste a good crisis,\" and that he was eager to press ahead with energy sector reform and a new free trade agreement with the European Union, to mention only two of many priorities. But, he said, Ukraine is having to carry out all these reforms without a European anchor, making an already difficult task that much harder. Chiming in on this, in characteristically trenchant terms, Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics said that \"the European Union has completely failed not only Ukraine but also Belarus, Moldova, and Georgia by not playing a more active role and holding up the prospect of EU membership.\" ### **Lessons learned the hard way** Turkey has had a good crisis, insofar as there is such a thing, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan told the packed auditorium. He said the crisis Turkey experienced in 2001 had prompted the country to clean up the country's banks, leaving them in good shape to weather the current crisis. But in general, he said, it is very difficult for governments to put the brakes on \"when everybody is happy,\" even though it is quite clear the banks are lending too generously. Turkey had also learned other lessons from its earlier crisis. After years of living above its means, it stabilized its fiscal deficit around 3 percent of GDP and brought public debt below 40 percent of GDP. \"So when the crisis hit, we had room to absorb some of the shock,\" Babacan said. Still, with unemployment now standing at close to 15 percent, Turkey has much to worry about. \"Governments should swallow the bitter pill of reforms today, before the feeling of urgency fades away,\" Babacan said, pointing to his government's new three-year plan. ### **So alike, and yet so different** For Slovakia, one of only two countries in central and eastern Europe to have adopted the euro, the eurozone had provided a safe haven during the crisis, said Ivan Miklo\u00c5\u00a1, a former deputy prime minister and minister of finance. Speaking more generally about emerging Europe, Miklo\u00c5\u00a1 said that a flexible exchange rate and less borrowing in foreign currency were two factors had helped Poland and the Czech Republic. The three Baltic republics had suffered more because of their fixed exchange rates and high fiscal and current account deficits. The latter was something they had in common with Hungary, one of the first countries to seek assistance from the IMF. ### **Help or hindrance** Much of the discussion centered on the IMF's engagement in the region. The moderator, Martin Wolf of the _Financial Times,_ wanted to know whether Turkey regarded its relationship with the IMF as having contributed to the country's successful transformation. After 17 uncompleted Stand-By Arrangements, the Turkish government had decided to take full ownership of the policies agreed with the IMF, Babacan said. \"We didn't agree to anything we did not want to do\". As a result, the last two Stand-By Arrangements had both been completed successfully, and the government is currently mulling whether to seek a new arrangement with the IMF. \"Views have been converging over the past 4'5 months,\" he said. \"The IMF had played a vital role in helping Ukraine survive the crisis,\" Nemyria said. He said the IMF had \"shown a more human face\" and a better appreciation of political realities, perhaps because the mission chief for Ukraine was from Turkey and understood what it was like for an emerging market country to be convulsed by crisis. For instance, the IMF had agreed to move from a balanced budget to a fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP in response to growing pressures on Ukraine's budget. ### **Preventing the next crisis** On everybody's mind here is whether it will one day become possible to prevent crises from happening. Ideally, an early warning system would flag growing vulnerabilities sufficiently in advance'and sufficiently convincingly'to allow policymakers to take corrective action. Pricking asset price bubbles, restricting unhedged foreign currency exposure of banks or borrowers, limiting leverage, and requiring higher capital ratios are all examples of ways to reduce the buildup of vulnerabilities. The IMF and the Financial Stability Board have been working on improving their early warning capacity and presented their new methodology at seminar here in Istanbul. There was much interest from policymakers. But as Minister Babacan had pointed out earlier in the day, measures to prick bubbles are hardly likely to be popular: home-owners would prefer to see a rapid increase in the value of their house, borrowers may be able to borrow more cheaply in foreign currency, and financial institutions do not like to have to hold more capital because it erodes their profitability. So even if crises could be predicted, it remains to be seen whether there will be sufficient political will to do what is necessary.

More than 15,000 people have come and gone. Now is the time to take stock and figure out how to move forward on the big decisions coming out of Istanbul. The IMF's Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, called them exactly that in his final speech at the plenary on October 6: \"The Istanbul Decisions.\" So what are they? The IMF's policy steering committee, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), asked the IMF to move forward in four areas: * Updating the IMF's mandate in light of the big changes in the global economy witnessed during the past decade * Reviewing the IMF's financing role, possibly beefing up its role as a lender of last resort * Rethinking multilateral surveillance, with the idea of introducing peer review of economic policies * Giving more voice and representation to dynamic emerging market and developing countries These Istanbul Decisions, Strauss-Kahn said, will be a focal point for the IMF's work in the coming year. For IMFC Chair Dr. Boutros-Ghali, \"the biggest accomplishment in the last twelve months has been to restore the IMF to its central role as a clearing house for policy, as a clearing house for financing, and as a clearing house for discussion and coordination among its members.\" On governance reform, Boutros-Ghali said he hoped the IMFC would take on a more hands-on role in setting out the direction for the IMF's work. \"The IMFC presently is an advisory body. The next step will be for the IMFC to be a decision-making body, to provide political cover to what the IMF is doing, to what its Executive Board is doing, and generally set the political direction for the institution.\" He acknowledged, however, that it would take some time to get there. But more than anything else, perhaps, these Meetings will be remembered as the time when the world allowed itself to draw a collective sigh of relief as the world economy edged away from the abyss. The IMF's First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky captured the mood well. \"Our members are hopeful that we have turned the corner on the recession. They hope our forecast is correct. There's certainly a sense of palpable risk but we're in much better shape than we were in the Spring,\" he said. Lipsky acknowledged that it's been a remarkable period for the IMF. \"We know that we are being looked to by our members, even at the highest level, to play a critical role in helping design and implement a series of important structural reforms both in the international system itself and in our members' economies that will hopefully make sure that the kind of crisis we're still going through won't reoccur any time soon,\" he said.

Now it is on the official agenda-and some of the civil society organizations (CSOs) who have been most interested and vocal on the subject have been participating in the debate with the IMF. Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn held a small meeting with civil society representatives from around the world-the final step of the so-called [Fourth Pillar process. The name, the Fourth Pillar, had a reason. Strauss-Kahn invited the CSOs to supplement the other three \"pillars\" who were submitting reports to the IMF on its governance-the IMF's [Independent Evaluation Office, the Executive Board [Working Group on IMF Corporate governance, and an [independent panel chaired by then South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel. The gathering on October 1 in Istanbul, ahead of the IMF's Annual Meetings, was the culmination of a five-month consultation with civil society organizations. The Fourth Pillar representatives, chaired by [Jo Marie Griesgraber of the Washington-based [New Rules for Global Finance coalition, presented their [final report to the Managing Director-which they had earlier discussed with the [IMF Executive Board. Jo Marie Griesgraber (l), Executive Director of New Rules for Global Finance Coalition, chairs meeting attended by IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss- Kahn (c), First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky in Istanbul (photo: Stephen Jaffe/IMF) The mood at this week's meeting was clearly helped by coming right after [the G-20 agreement in Pittsburghthat called for shifting IMF country weightings toward dynamic emerging market and developing countries (from over- to under-represented countries). And while CSOs made it clear at the meeting that they expect much more, they recognized that some progress is being made. **A historic step** Strauss-Kahn welcomed the report and told CSOs that the Fourth Pillar will have an impact: indeed CSO suggestions are already being considered. But he acknowledged that of course change may \"not be at a pace you want.\" CSO representatives emphasized three areas in their presentations: changing quotas and the distribution of seats on the IMF Executive Board; introducing a double majority in Board voting procedures; and strengthening Fund accountability for programs in borrowing countries and Executive board accountability. A more detailed account of the meetings will be posted later on the Fund's [website. **Responding to concerns** The Fourth Pillar was originally proposed by the IMF in response to requests from CSOs for a role in the Fund's governance reform process. Under this process, CSOs, academics, and analysts submitted recommendations and information three times, including the final report. Their deliberations were conducted through [a website and international videoconferences facilitated by Fund staff.

He spoke to a gathering of students about the role of the IMF in the current crisis, and took some of their questions. The Managing Director likened the IMF to an 'economic Red Cross'\u009d because its goal is to help solve a country's economic problems while avoiding social unrest and war. He noted that the relationship between peace and economic stability was well understood by the people who founded the IMF in 1944, in the aftermath of the Great Depression and the second world war. Continuing with the medical analogy, he pointed out that countries only need IMF resources when they are 'sick'\u009d'when they face serious balance of payments problems requiring policy adjustment. If you go to the doctor with a liver problem, he mused, the doctor will treat you, yes, but will also insist that you stop drinking. So policy conditions are necessary. Still, the Managing Director admitted, the medicine had sometimes been too bitter in the past. The IMF had developed a 'harsh image'\u009d'not paying enough attention to local circumstances, political realities, or social consequences. It was seen as more of a policeman than a doctor. Strauss-Kahn at Bilgi University: IMF is like an 'economic Red Cross'\u009d because its goal is to help solve a country's economic problems while avoiding social unrest and war (photo: Stephen Jaffe/IMF) But the IMF has learned lessons from the past, he noted. Today, our lending is more flexible, taking country circumstances into account, focusing only on core conditions. The Managing Director also emphasized the role of 'social conditionality,'\u009d where our lending programs have elements explicitly dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable. He also noted that the IMF is lending dramatically more to low-income countries, and is doing so at zero interest. The students asked some good questions about the Fund's role. Some wondered if IMF involvement was really good for a country at all. Perhaps the IMF was the problem rather than the solution. The Managing Director stressed that even though mistakes were made during the Asian crisis, the countries that took the IMF medicine are in pretty good shape right now. And today, he noted, our programs are better designed and hence more effective. In many countries today'including in Africa'the IMF is seen as more of a solution than a problem. Strauss-Kahn argued that the international cooperation on display during the crisis was one of the main reasons why the global economy averted disaster, and why a recovery is now on the horizon. A big worry, he noted, had been that this experiment would end when danger fades into the background. But the G-20 decided to go on working together after the crisis. This was a good sign, and he expressed the hope that we may be entering an era in which a global economy will be managed at the global level. On the whole, it was a good debate. Unfortunately, a small group was not interested in debate, and instead tried to disrupt the event as the Managing Director was on the verge of wrapping up. One threw a shoe and tried to rush the stage, while another tried to unfurl a banner. Nobody was hurt, and it was quickly over. After the event, the Managing Director stressed the importance of having an open debate. He was glad to meet students and hear their views. And with a touch of humor, he noted that Turkish students were polite'they waited until the end to complain!

And, equally importantly, the Meetings are a chance for Turkey to showcase its role as an important player in the global economy. At a packed press conference on September 30, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Ali Babacan said that Turkey's hosting of 'such strategically important meetings is a very important event'\u00a6It is a new occasion to enhance the visibility of not only Turkey but also Istanbul.'\u009d Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Ali Babacan: \"A new occasion to enhance the visibility of not only Turkey but also Istanbul'\u009d (photo: Stephen Jaffe/IMF) Turkey certainly has a lot to highlight. The Turkish economy is the world's 17th largest, with a per capita GDP in PPP terms of about $13,100 at end-2008. The IMF is also fortunate to have many talented Turkish economists on its staff, some of whom have been featured in recent Fund [videos. Before the global economic crisis hit, foreign direct investment in Turkey surged from an annual average of $1.1 billion during1993-2002 to $20 billion during 2006-08, suggesting investors are well aware of the country's potential. And let's not forget that Turkey is a member of the Group of Twenty (G-20) industrialized and emerging market economies, whose leaders have just wrapped up their [third summit in Pittsburgh. **Ship shape**** ** Turkey became a full member of the IMF in 1947, and in 1955, Istanbul hosted the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. This makes Turkey the only country, apart from the United States (where the IMF and the World Bank are headquartered), to have hosted the Meetings twice. Back in 1955, there wasn't a global economic crisis to deal with, only a local shortage of hotel rooms. The problem was solved by housing the secretariat of the Meetings on a ship called the S.S. Adana, which was moored in the harbor. The Governors were housed in two newly built hotels, and the Meetings were held at the University of Istanbul. Today, there are plenty of hotel rooms in Istanbul to accommodate the more than 13,000 delegates expected to attend the various events, most of which will take place in the new $215 million Istanbul Conference Center in the European section of the city. The people of Istanbul will have to be patient with the traffic snags and delays (something I apologized for in advance in my recent broadcast interview with [CNBC Europe!). **Dynamic shifts**** ** Turkey and the IMF have worked closely to make the upcoming Meetings, being attended by 1,300 journalists, a success. This cooperation has been particularly intense this year as we have jointly prepared for what is expected to be a crucial international gathering of policymakers, who will plan for the recovery phase of the crisis and how to avoid a repeat. 'The international community'more than ever'needs to get together more frequently because we are faced with massive global challenges. In particular, the current global financial crisis requires global policy coordination,'\u009d now Finance Minister Mehmet \u00c5?im\u00c5?ek told us back in April. He also hoped that the Istanbul Meetings would be an important part of the process of reforming the international financial institutions, as well as enhancing the current policy response to the global crisis. Indications are that he may see at least part of his wish come true. Important progress was made on both these fronts last week, when the G-20 leaders wrapped up the Pittsburgh Summit. There, the leaders [supported a shift in country representation at the IMF of at least 5 percent toward dynamic emerging market and developing countries. Emerging market countries, including Turkey, have been pushing in recent years for improved voice and representation at the IMF.

Although it is a bit early to be evaluating these programs, 'real-time'\u009d cross-country reviews are important. In today's blog, I want to pick up a few takeaways from our latest review. First, there is the sheer scale of the challenges the program countries, and the IMF, have faced. In Chart 1 below, each bubble is a Fund program'its size being the amount of lending and the vertical distance being the GDP loss associated with the crisis. You can see how, after a few quiet years while emerging markets boomed, the crisis hit hard: multiple simultaneous crises involving severe output crashes, and massive Fund financing. From our perspective at the IMF, it's been quite a challenge to manage all these [new programs, some of which were put in place within weeks of the crisis hitting. (click on each chart for a larger image) **Chart 1** [ Importantly compared to the past, the IMF financing has been more frontloaded, and more flexibly deployed, being used to meet funding needs in both the private and public sectors, rather than being retained in reserves (see Chart 2). **Chart 2** [ This proactive Fund financing role has succeeded in avoiding the worst of the problems seen during past crises. With only a few exceptions, we have not seen banking crises and deposit runs'hallmarks of past crises. This is quite remarkable, considering that this has been first and foremost a financial crisis in the advanced countries'the source of huge externally financed credit booms in many countries, especially in Eastern Europe. I think this success speaks to the importance countries have placed on quickly getting in place bank liquidity measures. But it also reflects another problem that these programs have avoided: excessive exchange rate and interest rate overshooting. **Chart 3** [ And there has been a significant shift in the approach to fiscal policy, with more accommodative stances than in the past. Chart 4 shows how 2009 fiscal deficits are being allowed to expand (a downward movement in the chart) in response to falling revenues. This expansion is affordable given the initial low public debt position in most program countries (shown on the horizontal axis)'although the programs are careful to include structural fiscal measures to ensure that fiscal balances and debt do not get out of control in the medium term, as you can see from the dotted blue line curling back up and to the left during the recovery phase. Both debt and deficits are in marked contrast to the advanced countries, whose debt levels started much higher and are projected to keep rising throughout the projection period. ** Chart 4** [ The accommodative stance of fiscal policy'measured by the increase in the overall fiscal deficit'across program countries tried to strike a balance between allowing deficits to widen in the face of falling revenues and ensuring that deficits did not go up so much that they damaged confidence or could not be financed. Thus, in the majority of cases, there was some form of real spending cuts, but considerably less than the 'automatic stabilizer effects'\u009d from falling revenues. **Chart 5** [ Finally, in recent years the IMF has paid a lot of attention to making the policy conditions applied to the programs it supports less burdensome. The review shows both a reduction in the total number of conditions (see Chart 6) and a greater focus on core areas essential to the success of the programs'notably the financial sector'than in the past. **Chart 6** [ Of course, there's a lot more in [the paper itself. I hope that you will read it and I would be very interested in your comments. I will do my best to respond to them.

It is the [most important reserve currency, accounting for at least two-thirds of reserve assets, according to the IMF's [Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves database. Among central banks that do not report this information to the IMF, it is estimated (e.g. by Brad Setser) that [70 percent is held in dollar assets. The [bulk of foreign exchange transactions involve dollars, and significantly [more trade gets settled in dollars than involves the United States. Goldberg and Tille examined 23 advanced and emerging economies in Asia and Europe and found that all settled a greater proportion of their trade in dollars than their trade with the United States. The divergence was particularly stark for emerging Asia, where trade with the United States only accounted for about 20 percent of total trade but the bulk of total trade was settled in dollars. ( ['Vehicle Currency Use in International Trade,'\u009d &_cdi=5812&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=21&_acct=C000055300&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2052542&md5=0282adfe28d2d01fd7b35d57e5bd8e0e)_ Journal of International Economics_, Issue 76, Vol. 2, pp. 177-192, December 2008). The recent crisis has prompted an abundance of commentary on the future of the international monetary system and potential alternative reserve currencies. Those calling for a re-examination of the dollar's role include [Italian economy minister Giulio Tremonti, [People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, [Ousm\u00c3\u00a8ne Jacques Mandeng of Ashmore Investment Management Limited, and Nobel Laureate [Joseph Stiglitz. What does all this mean for the future of the international monetary system and the role of the dollar? First, let's recall that while under the Bretton Woods system, the dollar's primacy was rooted in law, this has not been the case for the past 30 years: dollar usage has continued as a matter of choice. Its widespread acceptance is partly the consequence of the dominant position of the U.S. economy, but has also been sustained by the following factors: * The depth and liquidity of the United States' financial and forex markets, which remained resilient even during the financial crisis. * The U.S. economy's track record of macroeconomic stability, which bolsters confidence in the dollar's long term purchasing power. * The willingness of the U.S. fiscal and monetary authorities to allow the dollar to be used in international transactions, and to generate sufficient high quality liabilities to meet international demand for assets denominated in dollars. * Network effects'the more a currency is used and held, the more useful it becomes, which in turn increases demand for it even more. Is a natural alternative to the dollar waiting in the wings? Any contender will need to exhibit these characteristics to a similar or superior degree. This post considers three alternatives: (1) new or multiple core reserve currencies; (2) a system based on the SDR; and (3) a _sui generis_ global reserve currency that circulates along with other currencies. **Competitors to the dollar** Based on economic size, there are potential competitors to the dollar on the horizon, most notably the euro. The [share of the euro in total international reserves has grown in the last decade, from 18 percent when the single currency was created to more than 25 percent today. By [one estimate, it could overtake the dollar by 2022. Looking further ahead, China's dynamic growth may lead to the renminbi becoming more widely accepted internationally. However, both are some way from rivaling the dollar across the criteria outlined above. Of course, merely replacing one dominant currency with another would do little, if anything, to alleviate the concerns that have been expressed about the current system. Potentially better would be a system where multiple currencies operate on a par. It is unclear, however, whether such a system could emerge on its own'given network effects'and, how stable it would be. In fact, the increased scope for arbitrage among the major reserve currencies could potentially make such a system unstable, unless tight policy coordination among reserve issuers could be achieved. To combine the advantages of multiple and single currency systems, a basket- based reserve system, perhaps built on the [IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), could be envisaged. The SDR is not a currency; it takes its value from its constituent currencies (currently, the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, and yen, but the basket is periodically reviewed), and this makes it more stable: if one of its constituent currencies depreciates, the share of the others in the basket rises proportionately, dampening the volatility of the basket. However, for the SDR to take on such a significant role, its liquidity would need to increase massively. While an increase in demand (from BRIC central banks) and supply of SDR assets (from the Fund) have recently materialized, the scale remains limited'about 4 percent of global reserves. Generating a liquid SDR market of the size needed to create a new reserve currency would be a major undertaking. **Global currency** An even more ambitious solution would be to move to a truly global currency, along the lines of Keynes's 'bancor'\u009d, that would circulate alongside countries' own currencies and would offer a store of value truly disconnected from economic conditions and policies in any country. To achieve this, one would need to set up a global monetary institution that would issue the global currency depending on global economic conditions, and that could act as a global lender of last resort. It would need to have an impeccable ('AAAA'\u009d) balance sheet, and governance arrangements that engender widespread credibility and acceptability. Given the practical and political challenges it raises, this option is probably one for the very long time horizon. But perhaps the experience with another international monetary authority, the European Central Bank, suggests that it is not altogether impossible. While it is interesting to speculate about the future of the international monetary system, and the dollar's role in it, the reality is that the current system has proved its resilience while the alternatives have not; and though change is likely over time, it will not happen overnight, or by decree. The key challenge for policy makers is to continuously nudge the system toward stability along the way.

However, the relevance of such yardsticks evaporated as a number of countries accumulated reserves that far surpass such levels, partly in reaction to emerging market financial crises of the 1990s and early part of this decade. [Brazil's reserves now exceed $200 billion, while [Russia's are more than $400 billion'and even these numbers are dwarfed by [China's reserves, which top $2,000 billion. _**Reserves are rising, driven by emerging markets and, increasingly, low- income countries**_ While very high reserves may give comfort in times of crisis, they are not without costs'for the holder of the reserves, and also for the stability of the international monetary system: * Reserve accumulation, by resisting currency appreciation, stimulates export-oriented production at the expense of domestic-demand oriented growth. For the reserve accumulating country, this may lead to unbalanced economic growth. By investing in foreign reserves, countries invest abroad rather than in their own economies. Countries with large stockpiles of reserves may therefore miss out on high-return domestic investments, like education, health and infrastructure. * In the global context, massive accumulation by key emerging markets of reserves mostly held as dollar assets supported a relatively strong U.S. dollar in spite of a growing current account deficit in the US. By thwarting exchange rate adjustment, this contributed to prolonged global economic imbalances. * In the long run, it is difficult to both meet the liquidity needs of the global economy and maintain macroeconomic stability in the reserve issuing country, a problem known as the [Triffin dilemma. In effect, to meet the world's ever-increasing demand for international reserves, reserve issuing countries such as the United States need to run external deficits that eventually undermine confidence in their currencies. Self-insurance is not the only driver of reserve accumulation (an export- oriented growth strategy might be another factor), but it is an important one, and it is worth considering ways of reducing the need for it: * More predictable access to official financing when capital flows are disrupted would help. The IMF's new crisis prevention tool, the [Flexible Credit Line, aims to provide just that for countries with very strong policies. The early experience with this new tool is encouraging'countries that signed up for it saw a marked improvement in market perceptions. * Increasing the amount of available official financing would also help. The [G-20's April 2009 commitment to triple the IMF's resources is a necessary complement to the reforms to our lending practices. The decision to provide these additional funds, which will increase the IMF's lending resources from $250 billion to $750 billion, is a major step in the right direction. However, even with this increase, the IMF's balance sheet remains much smaller relative to the global economy and members' own reserves than it was at the time of the Fund's creation. * [Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a reserve currency issued by the IMF to its member countries, can provide countries with greater access to liquidity, making them a potentially powerful crisis response tool. Of the [$283 billion SDRs allocated in August and September, about $110 billion will go to emerging and developing countries, significantly improving their liquidity positions. While lowering reserve accumulation in some countries would provide benefits to them and to the global monetary system, to do so too quickly could be disruptive for a still-fragile global economy. For now, many countries will want to keep the security that their reserves provide. It is therefore also important to consider how the appeal of alternative reserve assets can be improved, to make the system less dependent on the stability of one currency'the U.S. dollar. To some extent, the increasing significance of the Euro, and possibly a number of other currencies, is a natural means of doing this. Other options theoretically available include creating an international currency'akin to Keynes's '_bancor_'\u009d'or expanding the role of SDRs. To what extent they may represent realistic alternatives, however, is another question.

It's easy to forget that only 10 years ago the Fund was a secretive institution. That's no longer the case. Communicating and engaging with the world at large is now a normal and essential part of the Fund's business. The IMF today is a very open institution. The vast majority of our reports are published. The public can search the IMF's archives. And we are making lots of effort to reach out to external stakeholders. The benefits of this increased transparency, both for the Fund's surveillance and lending activities, are indisputable. Transparency allows us to engage with the public and to build a broader understanding and support of what we do. It benefits the _quality_ of our advice by subjecting our analysis to outside scrutiny. And more generally, it makes us more _accountable_ for our advice and financial decisions. In all, it makes us a more _effective_ and _legitimate_ institution. Frankly, the Fund cannot be a genuine leader on economic policy issues unless it is seen as transparent. We certainly would not have been able to achieve the major reforms of our lending frameworks and the increase in our financial resources had we not been seen as an open and transparent institution. Rightly, the public expects to know what we are up to. At the same time, certain aspects of transparency remain controversial. Some believe that publication undermines candor in the reports, the frankness of discussions between staff and country authorities, and the Fund's role as trusted advisor. Communicating and engaging with the world at large is now a normal and essential part of the Fund's business (photo: IMF) We are gearing up to review the Fund's transparency policy shortly after our [Annual Meetings (which will be held in Istanbul in early October), as part of our efforts to increase our effectiveness. Here are some of the key facts that are informing this work: * All the reports for recent crisis programs cases'involving very large financing packages ('exceptional access'\u009d) from the Fund'have been published. This is the first financial crisis with this type of transparency from the Fund. * Close to 90 percent of country reports are published'and recall they can only be published with the explicit consent of the member country. * However, publication lags remain long. On average, it takes over 40 days for a country report to be published after the Executive Board meeting at which the report is discussed. There are many reasons for delays, but one seems to be the process of getting the member's consent for publication. * Moreover, the crisis environment, combined with a need for clear and candid assessments of exchange rates, risks, and spillovers, has put transparency policy to the test. Before consenting to publication, a member can request limited modifications to the report, though these have to meet strict [criteria. Since the start of the crisis, we have seen a sharp increase in countries' requests to delete information, mostly on grounds of market sensitivity. What are the main challenges now? The IMF has come a long way over the last 10 years, and publication rates of reports are high. Raising them further is not the main issue, nor one that can easily be resolved without changes much of our membership would consider revolutionary (such as making publication mandatory). Rather, further efforts should focus on making progress on a broad front, on issues that may catch fewer headlines, but are nevertheless crucial: * _**Reducing long publication lags.**_ How can we simplify the cumbersome procedure for obtaining consent? * **_Maintaining the integrity of reports._** The IMF's analysis and advice must be, and be seen to be, convincing, candid, and independent.** **To this end, there is a long-standing and fundamental principle that Fund reports are not 'negotiated'\u009d documents. **** * **_Making the Fund's archives more accessible._** The current setup for searching the archives'in particular the need to travel to Washington to gain full access to them'is outdated. We should also consider whether we can make some archived material available more quickly to the public. As part of the background work for the review of the transparency policy, we have been seeking views from the public, including in a meeting with [civil society organizations in April and via web surveys. You can find a summary of them [here.

This worry was neither new nor surprising. For decades, private international capital flows had grown at a much faster rate than those of the IMF, rendering our institution too small to be able to deal with systemic crises. As one country after another approached the Fund for financial assistance, it become clear that the international community needed to act decisively. Thus in April, the leaders of the G-20 industrial and emerging market countries, supported by the entire IMF membership, called for a tripling of the IMF's lending resources from $250 billion to $750 billion. By early September, individual country pledges, including from many non-G20 countries, had reached the promised $500 billion in contingent resources that could be called by the Fund if needed. In parallel, the Fund has been modernizing its lending and conditionality framework to deploy its resources more effectively. A key feature of the reform was to provide precautionary or contingent lending on an unprecedented scale and on unprecedented terms. The most important innovation for the emerging markets was the introduction in March of a new instrument: the Flexible Credit Line. This provides exceptionally high financial support with no policy conditions for members with a track record of very strong policies. This was a major breakthrough: strong performers were able to take out insurance with the Fund, and those taking up the offer'far from being 'stigmatized'were rewarded by a positive market reaction (see charts). Increasing our lending resources and reforming our lending facilities has undoubtedly helped immensely in stabilizing the financial markets. The significant boost in Fund resources, and our ability to deploy them in a contingent manner ahead of an actual payments crisis, convinced the markets that a safety net was in place to protect the global economy against even extreme outcomes. Since the crisis began, the IMF has committed $165 billion of its enlarged resources, i.e., about a quarter of its new lending capacity. Will we still need the rest of the pledged resources even as the impact of the crisis wanes? The answer is an emphatic yes. It is too early to declare victory over the crisis. Many emerging market and developing countries are likely to remain vulnerable to unanticipated shocks and rollover risks for the foreseeable future. Some members with Fund programs also have deep intra- and inter-regional systemic links, such that the risk of spillovers remains high. **Need for warchest** More generally, the recent experience has demonstrated just how important it is to have large resources available at short notice to forestall major financial stress. The core argument is that crises can become globally synchronous and even lead to countries that normally have easy market access to borrow from the Fund. Some academics have called for the Fund's resources to be expanded even more, arguing that the availability of large resources would forestall the actual need for the IMF to intervene, and also prevent sudden stops in capital flows. For example, Simon Johnson [has suggested that at least $1 trillion is needed, while Guillermo Calvo [has underscored the important lender- of-last-resort role played by the IMF. With a stronger resource base, the Fund would also avoid the need to mobilize resources during a crisis, which may be more challenging in future crises. Reliable access to large-scale liquidity support could also reduce countries' desire to self-insure by stockpiling reserves'which itself has been an important contributor to the build-up of global imbalances. Is there a downside? Well, some have argued that too large a Fund could increase moral hazard and global risk, whether explicitly via a growing member of precautionary programs or implicitly by the mere existence of financing. But we have heard these arguments before, and the crisis has only rendered them more unconvincing'after all, fire departments don't cause fires. Finally, let's not forget that the resources available to the Fund are contingent and the Fund is increasingly providing contingent credit. Unless the funds are actually needed and disbursed, the resources will not be called. That is the elegance of contingent financing.

With similar intentions, leading policymakers and stakeholders in Africa gathered in Tanzania last March to discuss how to work with the IMF on this. Under the leadership of President Kikwete and IMF Managing Director Strauss-Kahn, the participants agreed to build [a new, stronger partnership. More than just rhetoric, these common goals included the IMF seeking more resources for Africa and reacting more rapidly, responsively, and flexibly. While much remains to be done, I think it is a fair to say that we have achieved a remarkable amount on both fronts'more in fact than I could have imagined when I started in my job just a little over a year ago. My colleague, [Hugh Bredenkamp has done a fine job detailing the [IMF's response to the needs of [low-income countries. In this post, I would like to talk a little about what it all means for Africa. Sorting cashew nuts in Tanzania As a reminder, the IMF agreed to mobilize $17 billion through 2014 for lending to low income countries, mostly in Africa'[trebling our lending capacity to these countries. This goes far beyond the promise given by our Managing Director in Tanzania to seek a doubling of concessional resources. The financial terms of IMF support have also become more concessional, with zero interest until the end of 2011, and will remain more concessional thereafter. And the IMF has moved quickly to deploy these resources in Africa. Among international institutions, it has an extraordinary capacity to react early to a country's needs, as I know from my own experience as a policymaker in my home country of [Liberia. Indeed, in the first eight months of 2009, we committed over $3 billion in new resources to countries in sub-Saharan Africa,** **trebling the total stock of outstanding commitments this year alone. **Addressing different needs** Plus, as Hugh explained, the Fund is also working to [better tailor this financing to the needs of the countries. Different countries have different needs. Even before the recent overhaul, we had committed this year to quick, upfront, and concessional lending of about $1.5 billion to 8 countries with immediate, shorter-term needs. These countries are generally stable, but have been hurt by falling exports, tourism and capital inflows. Examples include Cameroon ($150 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($200 million), Ethiopia ($240 million), Kenya ($175 million), Mozambique ($175 million), and Tanzania ($340 million). We are also lending a further $1.5 billion to 8 countries with longer term financing needs'these countries include Cote d'Ivoire ($560 million), Ghana ($600 million), and Zambia ($265 million). The reforms call for the Fund to respond flexibly as well as rapidly. In four cases, countries qualified for rapid access based on current policy measures. For others, structural conditions have been re-focused on core objectives and will be evaluated on a holistic basis rather than strict compliance with specific conditions. An ongoing review of the debt sustainability framework should take account of the diversity of debt profiles in African countries. Another critical area lies in helping Africa build more capacity to weather the storm. Strengthening capacity for macroeconomic management in Africa remains critical. Given the effects of the crisis, we have seen a marked increase in requests for assistance related to domestic revenue mobilization, including from the exploitation of natural resources. We hope to meet these increased demands while continuing to focus on improving countries' budget processes. **Regional technical assistance centers** An increasing share of our capacity building is being delivered through our three African Regional Technical Assistance Centers (AFRITACs). Countries say they like the centers' proximity, and the fact that all stakeholders play a role. To build on this successful model, we are aiming to raise more funds to scale up the existing centers and establish two new ones, which will enable us to extend coverage to all of the countries in the region. We are also continuing to support capacity rebuilding efforts of post-conflict and fragile states'something important to me given my own experience. This year, the countries receiving intensive and wide-ranging technical assistance include Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Zimbabwe. Overall, I feel the current crisis is showing the Fund at its best'as a dedicated, highly professional institution that is able to respond quickly to the needs of its members. And I am pleased that, under the leadership of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF is keeping attention focused on Africa's needs, even as larger, higher-profile economies dominate the global headlines. Now, we must continue to live up to the high expectations that we have raised for our partnership with Africa.

Debt levels were also much lower than in the early 1990s, supported of course by recent debt relief initiatives. Inflation had been brought under control across most of the region. And, reflecting sounder and more open policies, countries had accumulated much larger buffers of foreign reserves'the median ratio of reserves to GDP was 14 percent last year, compared to about 5 percent in the early 1970s.

They were able to respond to the crisis by allowing fiscal deficits to rise and interest rates to fall, reaping the rewards of previous good policies. Countries with flexible exchange rates also let them adjust to the changing external environment. Such policy responses helped economies absorb some of the impact of the external shocks. Not all countries were able to take this route, however. Faced with large macroeconomic imbalances that pre-dated the global slowdown, a few countries had to tighten their fiscal or monetary policy stance. **Spending levels maintained** Let me expand a bit on fiscal policy. Ideally, fiscal policy should counteract the crisis, not make it worse. And indeed, as government revenues have fallen in the face of slowing growth, fiscal deficits have risen in most countries, providing some support to economic activity. True, such 'automatic stabilizers'\u009d are less powerful than in higher income countries because taxes in Africa are less closely tied to employment income and there are fewer safety nets. But still, the fact that countries have been able to maintain spending levels in the face of adverse revenue effects has been very important in containing the impact of the global recession'this was not the case in the past. Even oil exporters, which have seen large declines in revenue, have managed to avoid the blunt spending cuts that characterized past downturns and have accommodated much of the fall in revenues. Some countries in Africa'such as Botswana, Mauritius, and Tanzania'have actually increased discretionary spending, producing more aggressive countercyclical action. Looking ahead, I see room to continue these supportive policies in many countries and even to strengthen them until we can be sure that the recovery has taken hold. The supportive stance of monetary policy has also helped to sustain domestic activity in many countries'and it has more to offer. Inflation in most countries has fallen to single digits, the amount of monetary policy easing to date has been modest, and the likelihood of a significant liquidity overhang seems minimal. Exchange rates have also been strengthening of late in many countries. So, except where countries are still grappling to control inflation, the time is ripe for further interest rate cuts. **Formidable challenges** Necessary though it is, I don't want to give the impression that any of this will be easy. Nor that all countries will be in a position to benefit immediately. In fact, the challenges and risks ahead are formidable. Let me mention just five concerns. * Where countries were already addressing macroeconomic imbalances prior to the slowdown, the options for softening its impact are very limited. Only by reprioritizing expenditure or attracting higher concessional finance could additional spending measures be contemplated. * Implementation capacity constraints may limit how effectively demand can be sustained from fiscal policy. We need continued efforts to improve public financial management. * Debt sustainability indicators have worsened. Not yet a cause for strong concern, but needing a watchful eye. At the least, any fiscal stimulus measures may need to go into reverse as the recovery takes hold. * Increased openness to trade and foreign capital is all well and good, but infrastructure gaps and other impediments to private sector-led growth are still very much an issue in the region. * Sharp increases in bank lending in many countries during the boom years inevitably pared credit quality. This is causing strain in some banking sectors and left others more vulnerable. It needs a watchful eye. Let's not forget the stakes either. Even if economies do improve, many in the region will remain vulnerable and in need of continued support. Urban unemployment and rural poverty have already risen, with very limited social safety nets in place. The improvements in public services that will be essential if countries are to move toward the [Millennium Development Goals may fall further behind as national and local budgets continue to be stretched. Many low-income countries, lacking the buffers provided by the strong external reserves of many oil producers, will remain heavily dependent on uncertain external assistance and private inflows, including remittances. And it is possible that aid pledges may not be fully realized. In these circumstances, support from the international financial institutions will remain crucial. Last week, my colleague Hugh Bredenkamp discussed how the IMF is responding to the needs of the [low-income countries. We have already committed almost $3 billion to sub-Saharan Africa this year'nearly three times as much as in the whole of 2008. In my next post, I will discuss in more detail how this money has been allocated and what else the IMF is doing to trying to help.

But how will it affect sub-Saharan Africa? A key lesson from the past is that global cycles matter for Africa. For sure, there have been definite idiosyncrasies in sub-Saharan African cycles'as will be discussed more fully in the forthcoming October issue of our _Regional Economic Outlook_'but the global dimension remains paramount. Previous global cycles'and I'm talking here about the regular fluctuations in global economic growth that bottomed out in 1975, 1982, and 1991'followed some clear patterns. Typically, the end of an unsustainably high period of global growth coincided with the emergence of production bottlenecks and a burst of inflation triggered by accelerating commodity prices (particularly oil), prompting a tightening of monetary policy. The subsequent downturns were relatively short and growth rates typically bounced back fairly quickly to previous levels. By and large, Africa followed this pattern too. But the timing and the strength of the recovery were a bit different. Growth rates stayed high during the first year of the global slowdown, and they tended to bottom out later. The rebound was slower, lagging global growth by a year or two. Critically, when growth did recover, it was generally hesitant and low. What can the past tell us about the present? It is clear that the initial shock to sub-Saharan Africa has been greater than in the past. This reflects both the magnitude of the global crisis and the deeper integration between the region and the world, both in trade and in financial markets. Look at the numbers'growth in sub-Saharan Africa will likely decline this year by over 5 percentage points relative to the three years preceding this slowdown, compared to a drop of 2\u00c2? percentage points in past cycles. Given this background, can activity in the region rebound more quickly this time, or will it follow historical patterns? That is the million dollar question. Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty, but I believe that there are some good reasons to expect a more positive outcome this time around. **Better policy environment** My main ground for optimism is that the policy environment is better than in the past. Countries have learned the hard way how to avoid the missteps that dragged down growth in the past. In previous downturns, countries had very limited room for maneuver on the fiscal and monetary fronts. Excessive spending and poor policy frameworks before the crisis gave rise to unsustainably wide fiscal and external balances. So, as the global recession hit, policymakers often resorted to restrictive polices, such as expenditure rationing, import constraints, foreign exchange controls, and intervention in their domestic economies. This time was different. Most economies were not saddled by macroeconomic imbalances at the start of the downturn, and policy levers were used more judiciously. Indeed, one of the striking features behind the upswing that preceded the current downturn, was that its underlying foundation was solid. Better macroeconomic policies, lower public debt levels, a more business- friendly climate, greater political freedom, less conflict, and increased openness to trade all contributed to the improved environment for growth. These factors both enabled advantage to be taken of the strength of world demand and ensured that domestic economies themselves provided sustainable drivers of growth. This improved environment means that there is a much better prospect that the recovery phase will be more firmly based this time. Provided of course that the improved policy stances of recent years are maintained. External and structural policies must remain open and supportive. The favorable starting point provides room for macroeconomic policies to support growth in the short term, but only attention to medium-term fiscal sustainability will ensure that these gains are maintained in the future. In my next post, I'll turn to what the current situation means specifically for fiscal and monetary policy, and other factors within Sub-Saharan Africa's control.

This week, I want to follow this theme, but hone in more on sub-Saharan Africa. I know this region reasonably well, both from current and past vantage points. In my present role, I am the director of the IMF's African department. Previously, I was minister of finance in [Liberia and, before that, I spent a significant part of my long World Bank career working on African countries. Grappling with the kinds of economic challenges that affect the lives of millions of Africans is a passion for me. In this first post, I want to talk about growth prospects for Africa. Let's take a step backwards. Before the global recession, [sub-Saharan Africa was generally booming. Output grew by about 6\u00c2? percent a year between 2002 and 2007'the highest rate in more than 30 years. This acceleration was broader than ever before, going beyond the typical short-lived commodity driven booms and touching many more countries. Hopes were high that the region was slowly but surely turning the corner. Workers making footwear in Nigeria at a factory funded by Hong Kong investment. (photo: Qiu Jun/Xinhua) Then, in a great reversal of fortune, the global economy went into a tail- spin. Initially, we hoped that the fallout in Africa would be limited. And, indeed, when the global financial tsunami made landfall, it first hit the relatively small number of countries with well-developed financial linkages to international capital markets. South Africa in particular faced difficult challenges as portfolio outflows spiked. Together with Ghana, Uganda and several other frontier markets, its currency plunged, confidence dipped, and foreign direct investment slowed. But the impact didn't stop there. Falling export demand and commodity prices battered economic activity in many more countries, including oil exporters in western and central Africa, causing fiscal and external balances to deteriorate significantly. Remittances from the diaspora shrank and credit dried up. The result, in many countries, was stalled growth. **Different this time round** In previous global downturns, such shocks would have had chipped away at economic stability in African countries. Without the ability to finance rising deficits, they would have put up the shutters'applying administrative constraints on imports, slashing government spending, or simply failing to pay bills. This time around, thanks to a step improvement in macroeconomic policies over the past decade, and helped by debt relief, things are different. Healthy foreign exchange reserves provide cushions to pay for imports, with flexible exchange rates also playing their part. Falling government revenues are accommodated by higher borrowing in a number of countries. So some of the shocks coming from the world economy have been absorbed, allowing much of domestic activity to be sustained. Still, nobody is escaping. Oil exporters have inevitably seen the greatest reversal in performance, mirroring the sharp swing in oil prices. The more developed countries in the region have also been pummeled. South Africa, the continent's largest economy and a driving force for growth in the region, has been badly bruised by its close integration with global financial markets and strong trade links with the rest of the world. It is suffering its first recession in over two decades, and negative spillovers from this powerhouse are spreading across the continent. The dubious honor of the steepest declines in output goes to Botswana and the Seychelles, which rely heavily on diamonds and tourism respectively. In both cases, GDP has fallen at double digit rates. **Some good news** There is some good news however in all of this. It comes from among the region's low-income countries, which have been least affected by global developments. Of course, countries that went into the crisis with significant economic imbalances'such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and [Ghana'are still faring poorly. And vulnerabilities and poverty remain high in all low- income countries. But some countries seem poised to escape relatively lightly, with modest slowdowns. In part this is simply because they are less integrated into the global economy. Many are also being helped by the fall in food and fuel prices from the spike last year that caused much disruption and hardship before the global recession hit. Some commodity exporters with a broad mix of commodities have seen their overall terms of trade improve. Reconstruction is also driving economic activity in a number of post-conflict countries, including C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Burundi, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. But, given the vulnerability of Africa's population, the stakes are higher than in other regions of the world.. The slowdown will dent the otherwise downwards trend in income poverty in the region. All sectors are feeling the impact, from cotton farmers receiving lower prices, to unemployed mineworkers, to informal workers in urban centers facing stiffer competition. And governments are having greater difficulty in maintaining services. The effects of these also threaten to linger long after the global recession has ended, through increased malnutrition and diminished levels of education and health. So where do we go from here? What does the more positive news on the world economy of the last few weeks mean for Africa? It is too early to say whether the worst is behind us. Evidence is patchy at best. Production in South Africa continued to fall through the second quarter. In most other countries, we do not have good high- frequency indicators that might pinpoint the bottom of the cycle. But the indirect evidence, such as monthly data on imports, exports, and tax revenues, is consistent with many having hit their nadir in the first half of this year. The question now is whether the region will be able to recover relatively quickly and preserve the hard-won gains of the last decade. Or if, instead, growth in the region will be anemic, as has typically been the case during past, when the pick-up in Africa has lagged well behind the rest of the world. This will be the subject of my next two blog posts.

One of the biggest impediments to rapid growth is a massive 'infrastructure deficit.'\u009d In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, indicators of road and rail infrastructure are only about half those in developing countries as a whole'comparisons with advanced economies, of course, would look even bleaker. Insufficient power generation capacity and telecommunications networks are also a big constraint. It is clear that large-scale investment programs, sustained over many years, will be needed to close these gaps. Both private and public sectors will have a role to play. The snag, of course, is that investment spending typically has to be financed by borrowing, and until quite recently, the ability of low-income country governments to take on more debt has been severely hampered by legacies from the past. Many had built up unsustainable debt as a result of bad borrowing and spending decisions, poor project implementation, weak revenue systems (governments could not collect the taxes needed to service the debts), and often bad luck (as their economies were hit by global shocks). In effect, these countries were caught in a debt trap. Infrastructure remains a big problem in many low-income countries (photo: Reuters) But the world is changing. Large-scale debt relief, as well as big improvements in policies and public institutions, means that an increasing number of countries can now ramp up investment spending more efficiently than in the past, and borrow more aggressively for that purpose. They are starting with a clean slate. But not all countries are at this point. In fact, the majority still have more to do to on the policy and institution building front, and will need to borrow cautiously in the interim. Nevertheless, the greater diversity we see now among low-income countries needs to be reflected in how IMF-supported programs are designed (alert readers will notice that this has been a theme in my blogs this week). What does this mean in practice? Well, for a start, we need a more flexible policy for setting limits on government debt in programs. For the past 30 years, the traditional low-income country program has permitted only highly concessional borrowing (that is, on subsidized terms), which generally rules out financing from the private sector, or from lenders who are not willing or able to provide sufficiently generous terms. There were case-by-case exceptions, but this was bascially the way it worked. We are now moving (effective in December) to a new framework with built-in flexibility, linked directly to the circumstances of individual countries. Those with the lowest debt vulnerabilities and strongest capacity to manage public resources (assessed on the basis of widely-used indicators) will have much greater leeway than in the past to pursue borrowing strategies that mix concessional and nonconcessional sources of finance. Given more financing options, they should be able to expand their investment programs, and move safely onto a higher growth path. Programs will continue to limit nonconcessional borrowing in countries with the highest vulnerabilities and lowest capacity. But these countries can gain more room for maneuver in the future, as they build capacity and improve their debt indicators'tasks that the IMF and others will help them achieve with advice and technical support. Together with our colleagues at the World Bank, we are also looking at ways to help countries develop borrowing plans that are somewhat more expansive, but without taking undue risks with debt sustainability. Finding better ways to quantify the growth impact of public investment programs, for example, could lead to more favorable debt sustainability assessments. That, in turn, could imply more room to borrow under the new debt limits policy that I have just described. A similar result could be obtained by taking remittances from migrant workers into account, since these boost a country's foreign exchange earnings, and have become very large indeed in some cases. We will continue to work on these issues in the months ahead. All in all, in the debt policy area as in other aspects of our work with low- income countries, our goal is to find new ways to help them meet _their_ goals'faster growth, reduced poverty, and graduation to middle-income country status in the not-too-distant future. We are the facilitators. Anyway, it's now time for me to sign off. The conversation on low-income countries continues next week, when you will hear from the director of the African department, Antoinette Sayeh.

Without this support, and that of other agencies and rich-country donors, governments would have to slash spending as their tax revenues slumped. This, of course, is the exact opposite of what any government should be doing in a recession'it would add fuel to the fire. But preserving or even increasing spending when revenues are declining means larger budget deficits, and more borrowing. Doesn't the IMF always preach tight budgets? The answer is 'not always.'\u009d Fiscal discipline and carefully- managed borrowing policies are essential for long-term economic health. But when economies are hit by temporary shocks'and the current recession, though severe, will surely be temporary'it makes sense for governments to use policy to limit the short-term damage. Indeed, the IMF's Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was among the first (as early as January 2008) to advocate a global fiscal stimulus as recession loomed. Some commentators suggested that this advice was really meant only for rich countries. Not so. What matters is whether the country could afford the stimulus, and those that can't include some advanced countries as well as some low-income countries. But every country that can afford it should do it. Farmers inspecting drought-affected corn in Kenya (photo: AFP) Fine, you might say, but has the IMF put its money where its mouth is? In low- income countries that have programs supported by the IMF (let's call them 'program countries'\u009d for short), have we actually adjusted the targets to allow more spending and higher deficits? The experience to date suggests that we have (we plan to publish a paper on this later in September). Budget deficits in program countries should get bigger this year, on average 2 percent of GDP higher than before the crisis. Some countries are preserving spending, and borrowing more to cover the recession-driven drop in tax revenues. Others have been able to take more active fiscal stimulus measures'about two-thirds of program countries have been able to _increase_ government spending despite declines in revenues. Inevitably, countries with more vulnerable debt positions had less room for maneuver, but this is consistent with our advice. And even for these countries, programs provide for some expansion in budget deficits in 2009. When the recovery arrives, countries will need to reverse temporary stimulus measures, and bring budget deficits down to sustainable levels. But they should not be forced into doing this prematurely, before it is clear that the recovery is underway, simply because they can't get affordable financing. This is a serious constraint. Low-income countries often have fewer borrowing options and their borrowing costs tend to be higher than in advanced and emerging economies. This is why scaled-up financial support from the IMF and donors is so important, especially this year and next, when the needs will be greatest. In all of this, the welfare of the poor must top our agenda. Countercyclical fiscal policy can certainly help protect jobs. But for many of the most vulnerable, when food prices triple, or remittance lifelines are cut dramatically, public social benefits are the only answer. We have therefore encouraged governments to safeguard social protection and other core social spending, and in most instances programs were able to increase this spending, targeted toward the most vulnerable. This being said, both the food and fuel price shocks and the global recession have exposed weaknesses in the fabric of social protection systems in most low-income countries. They need better mechanisms to channel support to the most needy, quickly and efficiently. This is an area where more work is needed before the next crisis hits. **Conditions cut by one third** We have also been trying to streamline the policy conditions attached to programs, to make them more effective. Drawing on lessons from the Asian crisis, the IMF made a strategic decision that programs should focus only on structural reforms that are essential to support sustainable, growth-oriented macroeconomic policies. Recent experience suggests we have made some progress in this direction. The number of conditions we use to monitor structural reforms in low-income country programs has fallen by a third compared with the early 2000s. Around 40 percent of these conditions are focused on measures to improve public resource management'better expenditure control systems, auditing and publication of government accounts, more efficient tax administration, and so on'that almost everyone agrees are critical to policy effectiveness. And it should be no surprise that, as we have streamlined, more reforms are being implemented now than in the past'ownership in action. There's one more step. Earlier this year, we redesigned the way that conditionality is applied to structural reforms in all IMF-supported programs. From now on, loans will no longer include conditions on specific, timebound measures. Instead, progress will be assessed as part of the regular program reviews'this will encourage more focus on the _objectives_ of the envisaged reforms, and give governments more flexibility in attaining their goals. In my final posting tomorrow, I will talk about another aspect of the IMF's more flexible approach in low-income countries, which has to do with how IMF- backed programs monitor and control countries' debt burdens. ", "index": 783}, {"pub": "9/2/2009", "title": "Low-income Countries: Different Strokes for Different Folks", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=388", "content": " By [Hugh Bredenkamp In my last post, I explained how the IMF has dramatically scaled up its concessional financial assistance to its low-income country members to help them cope with the [current global financial crisis. Today, I want to get beyond _how much_ is being lent, and turn to the _how_. It's not enough simply to push out money'vital though that is. We also need to meet the particular needs of the country in question, and these are quite varied. Precisely with this in mind, the IMF has been changing the way it lends to low-income countries. In the jargon, we call this 'facilities reform.'\u009d We want to make lending more flexible, and better tailored to the different needs of an increasingly diverse group of low-income countries. It's a question of horses for courses, as the expression goes. What was the case beforehand? Well, the centerpiece of the IMF's concessional financial support for low-income countries for the last decade has been the [Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Established in 1999, the PRGF addressed deep-seated balance of payments constraints'the very constraints that prevented low-income countries, year after year, from importing necessary goods and services, including the investment goods they needed to grow and develop. With these kinds of problems, there was no quick fix. So country programs under the PRGF emphasized deep structural reform, implemented over several years and supported by concessional loans from the Fund'backed by debt relief in certain cases'to create the conditions for strong, sustainable growth. It's no secret that IMF lending to low-income countries attracted some criticism over the years. Some people thought the adjustment policies were too harsh, or even misguided. It is true that, for a while, the results were not encouraging. But all the pieces began to fall into place early in this decade. Governments took heart as outcomes improved, and this created a virtuous circle, with better policies leading to still better results. A strong global economy for much of this time helped too. If we look back now at [the overall record, the countries' efforts paid off'PRGF programs have helped them achieve higher growth and lower inflation, supported by higher levels of foreign aid. Those countries with sustained program engagement'covering at least ten of the past twenty years under the PRGF and its predecessor'saw their economic growth rates roughly double, from an average of 2.7 percent in the 1980s to 5.3 percent over 2000-2007. In contrast, countries with more limited engagement with the IMF recorded more modest gains in growth, from 3.4 percent to 4.4 percent on average. Other economic variables, such as levels of foreign aid, show similar differences. If the PRGF is working then, why do we need to change it? In short, because the circumstances are changing, and changing rapidly. Not all countries need the kind of extended engagement the PRGF implies. What this means, of course, is that the IMF needs a wider array of facilities. The greater diversity among the low-income countries should be paralleled by a greater diversity in the structure of facilities. The best way to illustrate this'and to summarize the new options we are offering countries'is to consider some hypothetical examples. Put yourself, first, in the shoes of a finance minister from a low-income country that still faces entrenched structural problems that will take time to fix. For this minister, having the Fund commit financing for a multi-year program is still likely to be the best option'it will buy time to make the necessary reforms and help mobilize additional donor support. In this case, the finance minister can borrow under the **[Extended Credit Facility**, the successor to the PRGF, which can support country programs of three years or more in duration. But let's say the low-income country in question does not need this kind of engagement. Let's say it has achieved a broadly stable economic environment, and is able to finance itself from other sources (private or official) in normal times. In this case, our finance minister will want to come to the IMF only for short-term assistance when her country hits a bump in the road, such as a fall in the price of a key export, or even a boom-bust cycle caused by policy mistakes. She faces a temporary financing gap that can be eliminated, with corrective policies as needed, within a year or two. This is not unlike the predicament often faced by emerging markets. Not surprisingly, then, the new lending window we are offering to low-income countries in this situation, the **[Stand-By Credit Facility**, mirrors in many respects the most common emerging market window (the Stand-By Facility), except that it is available on concessional terms. And as with its emerging market counterpart, this facility can be used on a precautionary basis for countries with strong policies. These countries might not need the money today, but they have the security blanket of rapid IMF support if needed. This option was not available under the previous structure of concessional facilities'a gap that became glaringly obvious as the global financial crisis began to unfold last fall. There are other possibilities. What if our finance minister found herself confronted by an urgent financing need and yet did not want a full-scale policy program, or was not in a position to seek it? The country might be coping with a natural disaster, or a temporary external shock. Or it might face political or administrative constraints that would make these kinds of policy adjustments difficult. To help countries in these situations, the new **[Rapid Credit Facility** can deliver financing quickly, in more limited amounts than are available under the two other windows, but with correspondingly lighter conditionality. **Emphasis on poverty reduction** Three [new facilities for three different situations. What they have in common is that they all put a heavy emphasis on poverty reduction. Countries need to document how IMF support will help spur growth and reduce poverty. There are also quantitative safeguards to protect social spending. In addition to providing more financing options, we are also making all our concessional loans cheaper. Given the exceptional circumstances brought about by the global financial crisis, no interest at all will be charged on concessional credit through the end of 2011. And after that, interest rates will be set low enough that concessionality will remain higher than in the past. With these changes to the range of its facilities, I think the IMF is now better equipped to meet the particular needs of its low-income country membership. In my next posting, I will discuss how the Fund is helping countries adapt the design of their programs, providing 'policy space'\u009d to address the fallout from the crisis and streamlining the conditions it applies to borrowing.

These countries were finally reaping the rewards of difficult reforms that go back to the 1980s and 1990s, helped by debt relief and other support. The results were plain to see. During 2000-07, low-income country growth was twice as high as in the previous decade, and inflation fell to single digits. As a result, these countries were finally starting to make inroads in raising living standards and reducing endemic poverty. There was great cause for optimism. And then came the crisis. Or crises, I should say. For in fact, the low-income countries were besieged by two crises in rapid succession, as the global financial tsunami came hard on the heels of the [food and fuel price shock of 2007-08. All of the hard-won gains were suddenly in jeopardy. And the stakes in this part of the world are particularly high, given the potential for human suffering on a wide scale. The effects of lower export volumes, remittances, investment flows, and prices for key export commodities could push hundreds of millions of desperately poor people back (or further) into poverty. **Victims of the crisis** We should remember also that the low-income countries were innocent victims of the crisis. They didn't make the mistakes of some of the advanced countries, the mistakes that triggered this crisis. Instead, they did many of the right things on the policy front'fiscal positions were strengthened, debt burdens reduced, and comfortable reserve cushions built up in many countries. This makes it all the more important now for the world community to do whatever it can to help. Of course, the top priority is to get the developed economies moving again, since these provide export markets, and are a vital source of investment capital. There are glimmers of hope on this score. But low-income countries also need extraordinary levels of financial support to cushion the downturn and give them some breathing space to take their own countercyclical policy measures. We need to ensure that they are in a position to share in the global recovery as it takes hold. This is where the Fund comes in. 'The IMF is back'\u009d has been a fairly common refrain over the past year or so. And it has some truth. But this mantra doesn't really apply to the low-income countries, because we never really left. Over the past two decades, four-fifths of the countries eligible for concessional (highly subsidized) assistance have received financing from the IMF. We have always taken our mandate to help low-income countries seriously. **Changing nuts and bolts of lending** Of course, this does not mean we were doing everything right, or that there was no room for improvement. It is a bit of a clich\u00c3\u00a9 to say that every crisis presents an opportunity, but there is a grain of truth to it in this context. For this crisis has prompted us to change the way we respond to the needs of low-income countries. We are changing not only how _much_ we lend, but also _how_ we lend'and by that I mean both the windows through which we provide assistance and the nuts and bolts of program design. Our immediate goal is to help countries adopt policies that will limit the damage to their economies from the crisis, to support those policies with expanded financial assistance, and to make that assistance quicker and easier to access than in the past. But we also believe that the 'new Fund'\u009d will be better able to meet the diverse needs of these countries long after this crisis subsides. There is a lot of ground to cover here. So, in this first post, I will focus on [the scaling-up of concessional lending, and leave the other issues to later posts. When the crisis hit, it was clear that our first and most urgent priority would be to provide [the financing low-income countries need, on the scale they need. And so we are ramping up our concessional lending to low- income countries by up to $17 billion between now and 2014, and are front- loading this support so that almost half ($8 billion) will be available for 2009-10, when the needs will be greatest. To allow individual countries to benefit from this, the annual limit on borrowing amounts for each country has also been roughly doubled. Putting this in perspective: these figures imply a doubling of our medium-term lending capacity, with support in 2009-10 at more than triple the pre-crisis levels. This is an unprecedented scaling up of assistance'and goes beyond what the G-20 leaders called on us to do last April. The circumstances demanded nothing less. **SDR allocation** On a parallel front, the Fund's membership backed a $250 billion allocation of [Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), to be given to all members in proportion to their IMF quotas. SDRs are reserve assets issued by the IMF, which can be tapped on demand, with no strings attached'although interest charges apply if the SDRs are drawn down. The [new SDRs were 'delivered'\u009d to members last Friday, with low-income countries receiving about $18 billion in funds that can help bolster or rebuild reserves in the wake of the crisis. Taken together, these steps will help relieve the financial constraints facing many low-income countries. But keep in mind that IMF financing serves a very specific purpose. Our lending provides low-income countries with shorter-term financing at affordable interest rates, so that they can preserve priority spending, like health and education, in the face of temporary shortfalls in tax revenues that are a symptom of the global recession. Crucial as such support is, these countries have much broader and longer-term needs for development financing, going well beyond what the IMF has the mandate or capacity to provide. Other institutions'multilateral development banks and bilateral donors'are best suited to these purposes. They too have a role to play, including during the crisis, which is why the IMF has called on the rich-country governments to meet their commitments to scale up aid to the poorest, without delay. In my next post, I will discuss the recent changes to the array of facilities or 'lending windows'\u009d through which countries can access IMF resources, and what these mean in concrete terms for the low-income countries these reforms are intended to help.

Yet whatever shape the recovery takes once the Great Recession ends, several significant long-term problems will have to be faced if a solid expansion is to be sustained. In particular, the principal sources of growth in many economies will shift, structural hurdles to growth will have to be overcome, the legacy of anti- crisis fiscal policies will have to be dealt with, and the governance of global economic policy will have to adjust to new realities. In other words, the agenda will be packed for many Jackson Hole Symposiums well into the future. At present, growth in the principal economies is being restarted with the help of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. As has been noted widely, a sustained expansion will require a shift back to private demand. Yet the U.S. recession has been marked by a significant increase in U.S. household saving out of current income that has been associated with the substantial losses in household net worth suffered during the past two years. The stimulus has provided a fillip to markets. An immediate result has been weak consumption spending, and a significant decline in the U.S. current account surplus. Not only did these shifts appear to be inevitable even before the current crisis, but they almost certainly are going to be long-lasting. In other words, it was the case prior to the crisis that sustaining a global expansion will require strengthened demand growth outside the United States, an aspect that the current crisis has served to make clear to all. This premise already underpinned the IMF-sponsored [Multilateral Consultations on Global Imbalances that took place in 2006/07. The aim of that exercise was to develop mutually consistent policies that would support sustained growth while reducing global imbalances by facilitating an appropriate shift internationally in the sources of growth, especially in economies that have relied on export-led growth. Whether the current crisis might have been moderated if the agreed policy programs had been fully implemented is moot, but the Consultation's broad policy goals will remain relevant in the post-crisis period. Moreover, IMF research indicating that the current crisis likely will leave a legacy of reduced potential growth was echoed by other Jackson Hole presentations. One implication of this analysis is that prospects for productivity-boosting restructuring and other reforms will assume heightened importance in coming years, as they will be crucial in helping to compensate for the expected dampening impact of the crisis on growth potential. This consideration applies to advanced economies like Japan and those in core Europe, as well to emerging market economies. While the formal program at Jackson Hole this year addressed the impact of fiscal stimulus on economic performance, the participants were well aware of the longer-term fiscal policy challenges that will have to be faced in the coming years, especially in economies with aging populations. Moreover, the large anti-crisis increases in fiscal deficits will leave a leagcy of substantially increased public debt outstanding. As [IMF research has underscored, reversing the crisis-related increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the G-20 countries will require a substantial and sustained strengthening in budget performance. For example, for advanced economies with debt above 60 percent of GDP, an improvement in the primary balance by a projected 5\u00c2? percentage points from 2014 would be needed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio back to that benchmark over 15 years. When the anticipated spending increases associated with population aging are taken into account, it is clear that the coming decade will be accompanied by acute budget challenges. The breadth and scope of the evident post-crisis challenges'and the shifting relative roles of advanced and emerging economies'has created an obvious need to reassess the institutions of global governance. The creation of the G-20 Leaders Summit as a new and effective venue for addressing economic and financial issues has been an important crisis-inspired innovation. The upcoming [Pittsburgh Leaders Summit no doubt will mandate new efforts to adjust existing institutions, in anticipation of the need to deal decisively with the set of post-crisis challeneges that loomed over the horizon at this year's Jackson Hole Symposium. Next week, this Blog will explore how the crisis is affecting low-income countries and the IMF's response. ", "index": 786}, {"pub": "8/25/2009", "title": "Fixing the Financial System", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=350", "content": " By [John Lipsky in Jackson Hole Despite tentative signs that the global recession is ending, it's clear that a full recovery will remain inhibited until financial markets are restored to health. While financial market conditions have improved'reflecting among other things massive public sector support'key credit channels remain strained, creating a drag on growth. One of the keys to strengthening financial markets will be to put securitization markets on a sounder footing, an issue I discuss below. Rebuilding active and innovative financial systems will be critical for sustaining a new global expansion. After being propped up by government intervention, a recovering economy increasingly will need to rely on private capital. As confidence and trust are restored, government guarantees will be rolled back gradually, and the crisis-driven expansion in central bank balance sheets will be unwound. The latest financial market developments have provided positive signals. Most markets have strengthened in recent months, and some asset prices are higher today than prior to last September's severe turmoil. Equity prices have risen notably, while investment grade corporate and sovereign emerging market debt spreads have narrowed, mainly in response to reduced risk perceptions, but in the case of corporate debt also reflecting better-than-expected economic data. However, banks' willingness and ability to lend remain weak in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Credit standards are still being tightened'albeit at a slowing pace'and bank credit growth is meager. At the same time, the increased issuance of corporate bonds largely has been motivated by refinancing and debt restructuring. Thus, the overall deleveraging process does not appear to have reached an end. Regarding banks, the healing process inevitably will involve raising additional capital and writing down impaired assets. This process appears to be further along in the United States than in Europe. However, the stress- testing process under way in the euro area should help to move the healing process forward. Nonetheless, no important acceleration in overall bank credit is expected anytime soon. **Reviving securitization markets** Securitization markets are still impaired, as issuance remains anemic despite narrower spreads. Gross issuance of securitized instruments by private-sector companies soared from almost nothing in the early 1990s to peak at almost $5 trillion in 2006, before dropping off sharply as the crisis escalated. Issuance is picking up in some specific market segments, but mostly those supported by public intervention. Structured credit markets remain essentially shut. Operations by key central banks'the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England'have helped to support and calm these markets, but the prospects for a rapid return to adequate functionality remains cloudy. Mobilizing otherwise illiquid assets and transferring credit risk away from the banking system to a more diversified set of holders is the underlying justification for securitization. Of course, this market has acquired something of a bad name following the subprime debacle. One of the key problems of the current financial crisis was that several major financial institutions didn't follow basic tenets of the 'originate-to-distribute'\u009d model. Not only did underwriting standards deteriorate severely in many key market segments, but many originators **didn't** distribute and retained far more risk than was prudent, often in opaque off-balance sheet entities whose relationship to the sponsoring institution was frequently misunderstood. The result was disastrous. In this sense, the market discipline that implicitly should underpin the securitization model simply failed. In restarting these markets, therefore, it will be important that the right balance is struck between allowing financial intermediaries adequate flexibility to create the intended benefits from securitization, while protecting the financial system from the instability that may arise from inadequate risk monitoring and control. There is little doubt that key market participants will have learned brutal lessons about risk management from the events of the past two years, and they are unlikely to simply repeat recent missteps. At the same time, financial regulators and supervisors are working together in various national and international fora on measures that can be taken to make securitized markets more reliable. Regardless of remaining problems, a key point shouldn't be missed: Securitization markets have become such an important component of the credit creation process, especially in the United States, that restarting them would represent a major contribution to restoring the credit channel. **Overhauling regulation** Part of the discussion at [Jackson Hole this year focused on the extent to which central banks should be involved in financial market regulation. While views differ on this aspect, it is agreed almost universally that the regulation of financial markets and institutions needs to be overhauled. The [principal goals are to broaden the regulatory perimeter in order to bring all systemically important institutions under regulatory oversight, to establish more effective tracking of systemic risks, and to promote more robust risk management. In other words, traditional regulation'that focuses almost exclusively on individual institutions and specific financial instruments'should be supplemented by a macroprudential approach that would take account of systemic and cyclical factors. This would create awareness of overall systemic leverage and interconnections and mitigate potential pro-cyclical effects of regulation. Market discipline will need to be strengthened through improved transparency, better governance structures, and more incentive-compatible compensation structures. To maintain a level playing field and alleviate risks of regulatory arbitrage, strengthened international cooperation and coordination will be essential. Some steps are being taken already: * Recent proposals by the United States to bring under stronger supervision large, systemically important firms, such as insurance companies and other financial institutions that are not banks, break new ground. The IMF has also strongly endorsed the ambitious reform of the European Union's financial stability architecture that was agreed in June. * Institutional arrangements for dealing with impaired assets are being put in place (notably in the United States and the United Kingdom), but difficult operational issues relating to the valuation and disposal of these assets still need to be addressed. * Following rigorous stress tests of balance sheets, viable banks should be quickly recapitalized, if necessary. Insolvent institutions should be promptly intervened, and either closed or merged. The creation of the [Financial Stability Board'of which the IMF is a key member'has energized international cooperation regarding regulatory reform. The FSB, working together with member country authorities, standard-setting bodies, and other international institutions 'including the IMF'aim to produce concrete proposals in the coming months that would improve systemic stability and market efficiency. This process will not be simple, but there was complete agreement at Jackson Hole that it is critically important. In my next post, I'll explore the need for rebalancing in the global economy as we emerge from this crisis. ", "index": 787}, {"pub": "8/24/2009", "title": "Jackson Hole conference:   A Grand Teton Perspective. . .", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=330", "content": " By [John Lipsky Every year at this time, senior Federal Reserve officials and central bank heads from around the world gather in [Jackson Hole, Wyoming'together with leading economists from universities and the private sector'to hear presentations on key policy topics and to discuss the challenges facing the global economy. The spectacularly beautiful setting at the foot of the Grand Teton mountains provides calm and perspective. Last year's gathering took place on the eve of historic financial turmoil and subsequent economic downturn. One year later, it is clear that progress is being made to overcome the crisis, but also that many fundamental changes will flow from the past year's challenges, even though the exact nature and course of these changes remain far from certain. The mountains' grandeur remains unaltered, of course, providing inspiration while insinuating an appropriate sense of humility. The story of the past year is well known: Faced with the very real possibility of a global financial meltdown, and the reality of the sharpest global economic downturn of the post-World War II period, policymakers around the world responded with a series of unprecedented actions'including massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, plus new governance initiatives. One year later, the signs are clear'if still tentative'of renewed growth, although opinions are divided regarding how effective specific policy actions have been, or about how soon the global economy will regain the pre-crisis level of output, or reestablish pre-crisis trend growth rates. This year's gathering naturally provided a welcome opportunity to review what has been done, to take stock of where things stand and to assess upcoming challenges. The timing is especially fortuitous, coming just weeks ahead of the Pittsburgh Leaders Summit, and of the [IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Istanbul. In my blogs this week, drawing among other things on my discussions with colleagues during the Jackson Hole Symposium, I'll be covering three main topics: * **_The near term challenges:_** While the worst has been avoided, the healing process is far from complete. Positive growth prospects for the coming year rest on the assumed implementation of a set of substantial policy actions and on private sector follow-through. Are those assumptions realistic? * **_Restoring the financial sector: _**The recovery will remain inhibited until financial markets return to more normal functionality. While there are positive signs'such as the rapid improvement in some emerging market debt and equity markets'many key securitization markets are still impaired. Moreover, public sector aid to financial markets and institutions remains very large, but it is intended that this support will be temporary. What needs to be done to restore markets, and how soon can that occur? * **_Addressing structural issues: _**Most important, structural changes in public policies and private markets will be needed in order to resume the unprecedented global growth of the past two decades'the so-called Great Moderation'and to protect against future turmoil. Among other things, this will require an assessment of the anti-crisis actions undertaken during the past year or so. At the same time, the fiscal policy challenges that will face all the advanced economies in the coming years will have to be dealt with, one way or another. What needs to be done in order to address these structural issues? The past year has been notable for both the scale and breadth of the challenges, but also for the speed and scope of the response. As Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed out in his [Jackson Hole address, 'the world has been through the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression'\u00a6. Unlike the 1930s'\u00a6during the past year monetary, fiscal, and financial policies around the world have been aggressive and complementary.'\u009d This aspect has been powerfully reflected in the G-20 Leaders process: Financial turmoil became acute in mid-September, and only two months later, the unprecedented Washington Leaders Summit laid out a detailed action plan. The London Leaders Summit in April underscored the G-20 authorities' determination to act decisively and cooperatively to reverse the global downturn. **More upbeat** Without any doubt, the mood in Jackson Hole was more upbeat than it would have been even a few months ago. Policymakers and central bankers can see that global growth prospects are reviving, and they sense that their actions are bearing fruit. Second quarter data for the largest advanced and emerging economies show either positive GDP growth or moderating rates of decline. Financial markets reflect a sharply improved assessment of overall risks. At this point, the global economy appears to be on a track consistent with the Fund's [World Economic Outlook (WEO). The WEO forecast anticipates a return to moderate global growth of around 2.5% in 2010, following a contraction of about 1.5% this year. Considering the risks faced a year ago, this is not a small achievement. However, even this moderate outcome can't be taken for granted. As the IMF's recent Fiscal Monitor, '[The State of Public Finances: A Cross-Country Fiscal Monitor,'\u009d points out, a substantial proportion of the discretionary spending measures pledged as part of the G20 support efforts'and assumed in the WEO forecast'are still to come. At the same time, a revival of private sector spending'including both consumption and business investment'will be essential for the recovery to take hold. That will require the normal cyclical incentives of profitable prospects and attractive financing. With inflation threats distant, there is little doubt that central bankers intend to keep policy interest rates very low for some time to come: one takeaway from Jackson Hole this year was policymakers' consensus to sustaining the current monetary stimulus, and to stand ready to act further, if needed. This is true regardless of the uncertainty about the potency of accommodative monetary policy under current circumstances. Moreover, opinions diverge about the efficacy of so-called unconventional measures. **Forging consensus ** Over the past thirty years, the Jackson Hole Symposium played a notable role in forging a consensus among monetary authorities on the conduct of monetary policy, as the [Taylor Rule and inflation targeting approaches supplanted an earlier focus on monetary aggregates. The current crisis has raised questions about whether a classic Taylor Rule or inflation targeting regimes are sufficient (if augmented by reformed financial regulation) to avoid future financial instability. For sure, there is virtually unanimous support for an overhaul of financial regulation. As always in these matters, however, the devil is in the details, and much work remains to be done. In my next post, I'll discuss the efforts under way to restore the banking sector and financial markets, particularly securitization markets, without which any rebuilding effort will be incomplete. Looking ahead, additional hurdles will have to be faced. As the Fund's Economic Counselor Oliver Blanchard has discussed recently in the IMF's [Finance &amp; Development magazine, the crisis may leave a painful legacy of reduced potential growth. At the same time, the inevitable renormalization of the U.S. household saving rate implies that domestic demand gains elsewhere'particularly in emerging Asia'likely will be required in order to reestablish and sustain a strong global expansion. Moreover, the past year's events has brought into higher relief the fiscal policy challenges facing the advanced economies in the coming years as a result of the prospective buildup of public indebtedness. I'll address these issues in a subsequent post.

Would emerging Europe face the same chaotic currency depreciations, mass defaults of banks and companies, double-digit output losses and social unrest that beset several Asian countries back then? Nine months into the crisis, it is clear that emerging Europe as a whole is not following Asia's script. But it is also clear that the crisis is evolving differently across countries. The Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) are suffering output declines that already exceed those of the Asian crisis (see chart below). By contrast, a milder version of the crisis is unfolding in central Europe (by which I mean the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, commonly referred to as the CE3) despite a much deeper global downturn than what we saw during the Asian crisis. Why have the CE3 and the Baltic countries experienced such different fates? An important part of the explanation might be the interplay between balance sheet vulnerabilities from borrowing in foreign currencies and the evolution of exchange rates during the crisis. Before laying out this argument in more detail, however, I want to stress that the CE3 and the three Baltic economies'all of which joined the European Union in May 2004 and have yet to adopt the euro'are far from homogeneous groups. For example, within the CE3, macro-financial vulnerabilities before the crisis were most pronounced in Hungary with its high level of public and external debt. In contrast, the Czech Republic and Poland were less exposed to swings in investor sentiment because of sounder fundamentals. Similarly, important differences exist within the Baltics. For example, Estonia's pre-crisis fiscal position was stronger than that of its two neighbors. Lithuania had a lower level of external debt, while Latvia's position was weaker on both counts. These are just some examples of the differences between these six countries. There are many more, but it would be impossible to do justice to all of them in a short blog post (which is already longer than my other posts). Therefore, readers interested in macro-financial vulnerabilities and economic policies of individual countries should consult the latest IMF country reports, press releases, and articles on the [Czech Republic, [Estonia, [Hungary, [Latvia, [Lithuania, and [Poland,_ _The focus in this blog will be on broadly common _regional_ characteristics and stylized facts that seem relevant for how the crisis is playing out. With this said, let's consider the CE3 and the Baltics in turn. Prior to the crisis, the CE3 resembled Asia in many ways. Current account deficits ranged from 3 percent to 8 percent of GDP (see chart below). Moreover, households and companies in Hungary (and to a lesser extent in Poland) had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies and were therefore vulnerable to a sharp depreciation in the exchange rate. Yet unlike the experience in Asia, exchange rate depreciations at the start of the crisis in the CE3 countries soon slowed. Since March 2009, the forint, zloty, and koruna have actually been regaining value, with central banks even leaning against the wind to rein in appreciation and rebuild reserves (see chart below). The modest depreciations have meant that serious distress for foreign-currency indebted corporations and households has been avoided, thus mitigating the adverse impact on jobs and growth that was seen in Asia because of balance sheet adjustments. But why were the depreciations modest? A part may just have been luck, but there are well-identified factors at play as well. * First, in contrast to the soft pegs in Asia, the CE3 currencies were floating, and were arguably only moderately overvalued. The initial depreciations by some 10-20 percent may have been just enough to restore a sense of competitive valuation. * Second, the CE3 economies never suffered a full 'sudden stop'\u009d of capital inflows as in Asia. Wholesale funding markets dried up, but western European parent banks maintained credit lines to their central European subsidiaries. (See also [my previous blog post on bank coordination in Europe_)_. In addition, bank supervision and capital levels in emerging Europe have been better than in Asia in the 1990s, helping limit financial sector strains. * Third, the task for external financial assistance was therefore mostly limited to replacing temporarily impaired wholesale funding markets. [Hungary'the economy most dependent on wholesale and securities funding, given the large amount of government bonds held by non-residents'received a $25 billion emergency financing package from the IMF and other institutions. [Poland also secured a $21 billion precautionary arrangement under the IMF's [flexible credit line to support market confidence. But in contrast to Hungary, the Polish authorities have not tapped IMF funds to replace market funding. * And fourth, EU membership may have instilled confidence in the region's long-term stability and catch-up potential due to an accelerated convergence process. This begs the question of why the Baltics have not been similarly 'lucky.'\u009d Perhaps the key reason is that they entered the crisis saddled with much larger imbalances. Current account deficits not only dwarfed those in central Europe, but also those in Asia in the late 1990s (see chart below). Hard currency pegs and expectations of early euro entry had helped attract large capital inflows, but these often fed real estate bubbles, caused heavy exchange rate overvaluations, and fostered a substantially larger accumulation of foreign-currency denominated private debt than in any other region (for an analysis of sectoral balance sheets see, for example, Chapter III of the 'Selected Issues'\u009d papers prepared for the 2009 Article IV consultation with [Estonia). Faced with such imbalances, governments in the Baltic countries understandably feared the disruptions that a nominal devaluation could cause. Instead, they decided to embark on a course of 'internal devaluation'\u009d'restoring competitiveness through wage and price declines rather than through a currency devaluation. Indeed, wages in the private sector are falling fast, thanks to the flexibility of these economies. In addition, it has been necessary to bring government spending in line with the countries' reduced means. In [Lithuania, for example, measures to reduce the fiscal deficit have exceeded 7 percent of GDP in 2009 alone. Latvia is faced with an even greater challenge and as my colleague Anne-Marie Gulde said in a recent [interview, 'In deciding to maintain the peg, the authorities have chosen a path that puts a heavy burden on fiscal policy in the short term. But even without the end goal of euro adoption to drive policy decisions, Latvia would have faced a very difficult policy environment and would over time have needed to bring expenditures in line with revenues.'\u009d Inevitably, though, the collapse in output in Baltic countries and the need for strong fiscal measures to address underlying budget weaknesses have fed on each other, complicating the task of policymakers. Sustained effort will be required for the strategy of internal devaluation to succeed, and it will need to be accomplished in a way that minimizes further pressure on economic activity and protects the most vulnerable groups in society at a time already marked by painful adjustment. But because of the prior overheating and major imbalances in the Baltics, balance sheet strains and output losses are unavoidable, with or without a currency devaluation. This blog post has put forward some preliminary views on the interplay between balance sheet vulnerabilities and the evolution of exchange rates to explain the different trajectory of the current crisis across countries in emerging Europe, compared with the unfolding of the Asian crisis in the late 1990s. It is by no means the last word on the subject'researchers will undoubtedly examine these issues in detail in the coming years. But perhaps this contribution can spark a first round of debate and your views are welcome Next week, John Lipsky, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, will be blogging from Jackson Hole. He'll give us his views about what's next for the global economy. If policies have accomplished their main goal'overcoming the recession'what should policymakers do next? As I mentioned in my blog, one key factor in deciding post-crisis policies is [potential output, something John also plans to discuss. So do check back with us on Monday.

As the global economic crisis has shown, the flipside of Europe's successful integration has been a synchronized economic downturn and complex financial spillovers between countries. For those of us involved in providing financing and policy advice to emerging Europe, it quickly became apparent that the official sector would be more effective if it managed to secure the cooperation of private western banks operating in emerging market countries in central, eastern, and southern Europe (CESE). During the past decade, western banks played an important role in developing the financial sector in emerging Europe, through ownership of banks and through direct cross-border lending to financial institutions and firms. But over time, CESE countries accumulated high levels of debt to western banks. Although these banks have a declared long-term interest in the region, they came under intense pressure to deleverage when the global financial crisis struck because of the weak financial conditions in both home and host countries and the diminishing appetite for risk at the global level. Uncertainty about other banks' strategies further exacerbated the pressure on individual banks to scale back lending to the region. Europe's economic and financial integration has been a tremendous success, but the region is now under great stress (photo: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images) These conditions could have given rise to a classic collective action problem where uncertainty about other players' actions trigger responses at the individual level that lead to inferior outcomes and higher collective costs. Had a sudden retrenchment occurred, the capital outflows from emerging Europe would have undermined financial institutions and the already fragile balance of payments position in many of these countries. The continued support from private banks to the region was therefore critical. That's why the IMF and other multilateral and regional organizations took the initiative to facilitate the collective action that was needed to foster financial sector stability in CESE countries and reduce the likelihood of a 'sudden stop'\u009d in capital flows. So how has it worked in practice? Typically, there has been a forum for direct engagement with international banks operating in a specific country. The aim is to secure parent banks' continued support, including through commitments regarding their future rollover and recapitalization efforts. The forum also provides an opportunity to inform participants of regulatory and supervisory actions by home and host supervisors. Meetings on specific countries bring together representatives from banks operating in the region, home and host officials (supervisors, central banks, and treasury officials), multilateral institutions'either a subgroup or all of the following depending on circumstances: the IMF, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the European Investment Bank, and the Committee of European Bank Supervisors'and other stakeholders as deemed necessary. Meetings on EU countries have been jointly chaired by the European Commission and the IMF; for countries outside the EU, the meetings have been chaired by the IMF. In the context of IMF-supported loan programs, country meetings have been held for [Bosnia, [Hungary, [Romania, and [Serbia. These meetings have aimed to secure commitments from banks to maintain exposure to these countries and provide capital support to their subsidiaries as needed. As such, they have provided an avenue for voluntary involvement of the private sector in IMF-supported programs. (A recent paper on the analytic basis for Fund lending has an interesting discussion on [private sector involvement in Box 3.) Apart from country-specific meetings, discussions among relevant stakeholders have led to deeper understanding of the problems, the policy actions taken, and the international dimensions of individual strategies. But we are not yet out of the woods. Although the country-specific meetings have helped keep the private sector engaged, there is a risk that containing deleveraging in some countries will come at the expense of other countries. Parent banks have said they worry that overly rigid country-level commitments could complicate their regional and global strategies. For example, consistent with their long-term commitment to the region, parent banks have noted that the viability of their investments would benefit if capital could shift between CESE countries. These concerns are valid and underscore that any bank coordination process needs to be dynamic so that it can adapt to underlying economic conditions. That's why it will be important for all stakeholders to take stock and discuss ways to bring a stronger regional perspective to bank coordination efforts and deal innovatively with new challenges as they arise. The global economic crisis has demonstrated just how interconnected the world has become. Regionally coordinated policy solutions have become essential to help strengthen confidence and secure better outcomes, raising the bar for all actors involved. iMFdirect ", "index": 790}, {"pub": "8/13/2009", "title": "Potential Output: Worrying About What Cannot Be Observed", "link": "http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/?p=278", "content": " By [Ajai Chopra Potential output seems to be on everybody's mind these days, at least if you talk to economists. What would be merely a curiosity during better times'after all, potential output is a largely abstract concept measuring the level of output an economy can produce without undue strain on resources'has become a particular worry in the context of the global economic crisis. So what is all the fuss about? In a nutshell, policymakers across Europe are concerned that the deep and long recession will affect supply capacity and weigh down the prospects for recovery. But even if the danger seems clear and present'people are still losing their jobs and businesses are still closing down with alarming speed'there is little clarity about just how big the drop in potential output is likely to be. For instance, [Davide Furceri and Annabelle Mourougane at the OECD estimate that potential output in a typical financial crisis will drop between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent for most countries. And [Gert Jan Koopman and Istv\u00c3 n Sz\u00c3\u00a9kely at the European Commission reckon that the level of losses for the European Union as a whole during the current crisis could be between 0.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Policymakers dislike this kind of uncertainty because it muddies the waters and makes it harder for them to make the right decisions. Right now, budget planners across Europe are scrambling to estimate the strength of the blow the crisis has dealt to public finances, and not knowing the growth potential of their economies greatly complicates their task. If they overestimate potential growth, they would underestimate the need for fiscal adjustment once the crisis has dissipated, raising thorny issues of fiscal sustainability in the longer run. Central bankers, too, are looking for guidance on the path of potential output. Their decision on when to start winding down current crisis policies depends on the difference between potential and actual output, the so-called output gap. If the output gap is closing faster because of a drop in potential, policymakers might decide to increase interest rates a little earlier and a little higher to prevent inflation from rising. Although this might sound farfetched at a time of falling headline inflation in Germany, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, those who are charged with safeguarding price stability have to look ahead to when the recovery will finally happen. Central banks' decision on when to start winding down current crisis policies depends in part on the difference between potential and actual output. Photo shows Bank of England (photo: Shaun Curry/AFP) So what are policymakers to do? The first step is to ask economists to do their best to correctly estimate potential output in the aftermath of the crisis. The more that is known about what is happening to potential output, the less reason there is to worry about getting it wrong. The IMF is one such source of independent advice on potential output. Recent country reports produced by IMF staff have used a variety of methodologies to produce such estimates.

Resolving the ongoing international crisis'with many institutions, countries, and regulators involved'is unusually challenging, both intellectually and in terms of practical policymaking. Progress has been made thanks to the slew of measures adopted by global policymakers. But a stabilized patient is not a cured patient, particularly when stabilization largely reflects significant shifts of risk from the private financial sector to the public sector. And the early reappearance of practices thought to have played a part in fueling the crisis'sizeable bonuses, for example'is troubling. Lessons on where to go from here can be drawn from past crises. [Sweden's approach to its banking crisis of the early 1990s is typically held up as a 'model'\u009d'quick, transparent, nationalization-cum-bad bank, low cost'and is contrasted with Japan's actions during the same decade. But a closer look tells us it may not have been that simple after all. IMF staff work for the [2009 Sweden Article IV consultation suggests that the lessons are richer and more subtle than often thought (see Attachment II of the report, prepared by Kotaro Ishi). For a start, Sweden did not act as promptly as some have suggested'comprehensive banking intervention occurred only two years after the crisis broke, a lag that closely mirrors the time that has elapsed since the current crisis began. Only one bank was nationalized and bad banks were more often than not simply bookkeeping and bad debt collection exercises within private banks. Sweden applied an explicit public guarantee on all bank deposits as part of its bank resolution (photo: Francis Dean/Dean Pictures) Nor is it clear that the measures taken to stabilize the banks were responsible for the relatively speedy recovery of Sweden's financial sector and economy'a complete revamp of macroeconomic policies, including a switch from a fix to a float and buoyant external market growth, may have played the critical role. Although the usual 'headline'\u009d lessons may be questioned, other richer lessons emerge. * Speedy action is not everything'a balance has to be struck between time for diagnosis and development of necessary political backing on the one hand, and not allowing the problems to fester on the other. The fact that Sweden avoided 'multiple bites at the cherry'\u009d suggests it might have got this tricky balance about right. * Sweden applied an explicit public guarantee on all bank deposits at the outset'to calm matters while diagnosis and policy preparations proceeded. Among the benefits was a clear exit strategy, because the crisis could be formally declared over once the guarantee was withdrawn. In contrast, the use of implicit guarantees in the current crisis raises complex issues, as the clearest exit from implicit guarantees is to allow institutions to fail. Since Lehman, the dangers of going down that particular route are acutely apparent. * Subsequent to the crisis, Sweden thoroughly reviewed its pre-crisis bank regulatory practices and found them wanting. But little action was taken as political opportunity evaporated along with easing of the crisis. Less than two decades later, another crisis struck. So even though global efforts to identify regulatory corrections are taking place right now, Sweden's experience warns of the danger of delay. Timeliness is a central component of the right reforms. So let's learn from Sweden's experience, but let's also make sure we learn the right lesssons.

Recent months have seen quite the opposite. Battling a sharp fall in inflation, central banks around the globe have slashed interest rates, often to close to zero. Several have also made headlines by adopting unconventional policies, including '[quantitative easing'\u009d at the Bank of England (BoE) and '[enhanced credit support'\u009d at the European Central Bank (ECB). Are these unconventional strategies working? And what are the associated risks? Two new IMF studies address these questions. **ECB's non-standard approach: uncharted waters** The ECB presents an unusual case. Its approach, unlike that of some other major central banks, has not involved outright purchases of sovereign debt. Instead, the ECB has used its standard framework, based on repurchase facilities. But within this framework it has employed nonstandard measures, including lengthening the maturity of these facilities and providing massive funds at fixed rates. In the [first study, Martin \u00c4?ih\u00c3\u00a1k, Thomas Harjes, and Emil Stavrev analyze the ECB's response to the financial crisis, using a combination of econometric approaches. They find that the ECB's measures have been useful in reducing money market term spreads, facilitating the pass-through from policy to market rates. Moreover, the measures may have had favorable effects on government bond term spreads. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet: ECB's measures have been useful in reducing money market term spreads (photo: Newscom) An important feature of the ECB's interventions is that the repurchase facilities will unwind naturally as they mature. This offers a relatively straightforward [exit path from the nonstandard measures. **Bank of England's quantitative easing: no panacea, no curse** In the United Kingdom, the use of quantitative easing has triggered a controversial public debate. Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Meier's [study analyzes the policy from a theoretical and empirical perspective. He finds that quantitative easing has had some positive effects, by raising asset prices and near-term inflation expectations. However, the policy provides only limited direct support to private credit markets, and its overall impact is too early to judge. Quantitative easing is not a panacea. But it is an important addition to the Bank's policy arsenal, and its expansion and change in emphasis on August 6 was appropriate. Meanwhile, the policy has prompted fears that the BoE might lose its operational independence and that inflation might return with a vengeance. Reassuringly, the quantitative easing framework is designed to contain such risks through a robust set of safeguards: * Full indemnity from the fiscal authority for possible capital losses (unique among major central banks) * Continued control over policy rates through reserve remuneration * Discretion to re-sell assets or issue central bank debt. These safeguards should help the BoE exit from quantitative easing when appropriate. To be sure, timing the exit will be a difficult judgment call, and fiscal policy must do its part to maintain investor confidence. But quantitative easing clearly need not be a curse either. Most likely, the policy will prove a useful extension of the BoE's standard toolkit in today's extraordinary circumstances'not all-powerful or entirely risk-free, but an important element in a set of policies to stabilize inflation and economic activity. Longer term, the objective should be to restore boredom. Today's unconventional measures will only be successful if they enable a return to the conventional.

In fits and starts, recovery is likely to get under way in coming months in most major economies. That is good news'especially compared to the gloom and fear earlier this year. But the bad news is that the social cost of the crisis is set to keep rising for some time. Unemployment'the symbol of the Great Depression'will get nowhere near the levels of the 1930s. But in advanced economies, jobless rates are already much higher than they have been for a long time. The [U.S. jobless numbers announced today give some encouragement, with a sharp decline in the number of jobs lost last month and an unexpected easing in the jobless rate. But, as a lagging indicator, unemployment worldwide is still expected to go on increasing well into 2010. The International Labor Organization thinks that as many as 50 million people could lose their jobs before this is all over. Of course, in emerging and low-income countries, where social safety nets are weak or non-existent, the human cost from unemployment is even higher. As a lagging indicator, unemployment worldwide is still expected to go on increasing well into 2010 (photo: Sergio Perez/Reuters) This puts the pressure'quite rightly'on policymakers to continue corrective policies, to fix the financial system and boost aggregate demand. It also has led the IMF to pay attention in our lending to what Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has called social conditionality. The IMF has been criticized in the past for paying too little attention to the social costs that come when countries are hit by economic crisis. Recent programs in countries from Belarus to C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire and Pakistan have carved out some room to protect the [most vulnerable. That will help. But the most important boost to living standards will come when the recovery has taken firm hold around the world. Next week, I will hand over the blog to [Ajai Chopra. He will lay out some interesting new research on Europe. Others will pick up after him, commenting on our work in the runup to the [IMF-World Bank the Annual Meetings in October in Istanbul. What do we hope to accomplish there? Of course, it will give an opportunity to take stock of the global financial crisis and the policy measures so far. But looking forward, participants will also debate the shape of the global economy to come. They will want to set policy for the way ahead. How can we resolve the crisis, without burdening future generations with too much debt, and build a lasting recovery? These are complex issues, and we'll be looking into some of them over coming weeks on this Blog.

Central bank governors are notorious for removing the punch bowl at the party. Ministers of finance are traditionally the ones who say no to their colleagues' pet spending projects. In the upside-down world of recent months, finance ministers and central bank governors around the world seemed to have switched sides. They became cheerleaders for expansionary policies. The IMF has argued strongly for this, as long as countries had room to take on more debt. Despite some hiccups, it seems clearer with every economic release that the extraordinary actions governments have taken have paid off, at least in halting the slide. Economic prospects may not be quite as bright as recent market moves would suggest. But the risk of spreading financial collapse [has lessened markedly. Cooperation among the world's leading economies has been crucial to this success. [IMF estimates showed that up to one-third of the boost to global growth expected from fiscal stimulus will reflect positive spillover effects. This reflects a kind of virtuous circle'with policy stimulus in one country helping growth in another, and so on'that is the opposite of the dire policies that spread misery during the Depression era. Policymakers showed they had learned the lessons of the 1930s. Up to one-third of the boost to global growth expected from fiscal stimulus will reflect positive spillover effects (photo: Norbert Millauer/AFP/Getty Images) Fiscal stimulus, cuts in interest rates, and steps to repair financial systems are working. So far so good. Economists widely called for these extraordinary measures, helping the profession to redeem its poor record in the runup to the crisis. But the question now is how to generate'and then foster'a strong and sustainable recovery. And the answers there are less clear'or at least there is less consensus. When and how should monetary stimulus be unwound? How should governments and central banks adapt their unprecedented support to the financial system, as fears of collapse ebb, but uncertainties about future loan losses remain? How should short-term needs for fiscal support to demand be balanced against looming deficits in the medium term in some countries? What does seem clear is that as countries grapple with these choices, cooperation among them will remain crucial. Restoring sustainable growth will require a [rebalancing act as well that complementary policies in different countries need to support. As far as financial reforms go, cooperation is also critical. As the [GFSR update last month noted, 'maintaining consistency of policies across countries [is needed] to minimize the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and adverse financial flows.'\u009d Within countries there is already a challenge, given the range of authorities and varying mandates involved. Across countries, the challenge of coherence and consistency is greater, but the stakes even higher. Work at the IMF on these issues is under way. We will be sharing our analysis in coming weeks.

The global economy has pulled back from the brink. Financial systems are beginning to function more normally. The panic that threatened to spread among depositors and savers earlier this year has receded. But enormous economic challenges remain, challenges that are often global in scope and may require a global response. It is against that background that economists and policymakers at the International Monetary Fund are now preparing for the [IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in early October. And as we do that, we wanted to open up our work to a broader audience. In coming weeks, senior staff and IMF management would like to discuss with you, through this blog, some of the key issues. The [2009 Annual Meetings will be in Istanbul, Turkey. They will bring together Ministers of Finance and Central bank governors from all 186 member countries, as well as academics, market participants, civil society, and journalists from around the world. And this year, the meetings will follow just after world leaders come together in Pittsburgh for the [G-20 summit. When G-20 leaders gathered in London in April, they did not yet have the bleak official numbers for GDP in the first quarter of 2009. But they knew that things were bad. Their agreement contained many important pledges for action, notably the commitment to the necessary economic steps'on fiscal, monetary, and financial policy'to stabilize their own economies. They also supported an unprecedented increase in IMF resources as part of a package 'to restore credit, growth and jobs in world economy.'\u009d Low-income countries were not forgotten. IMF Managing Director Strauss-Kahn called for a doubling of the Fund's concessional lending. G-20 leaders agreed.

New IMF facilities have been agreed for both our [ general and [concessional lending. Just last week, we announced a [big package to support the world's poorest during the crisis, including additional resources for lending to low-income countries of up to $17 billion over the next five years. Earlier, the new [flexible credit line was introduced, with three countries now using it. Reforms to [conditionality have also been implemented. Much has been done'by governments and by international institutions'to address the immediate crisis. But with unemployment still set to rise around the world, and only a sluggish recovery on the cards, much remains to be done. And as the crisis eases, policymakers may face a more difficult environment. We at the IMF have argued that macroeconomic policies need to continue to support demand to ensure the [recovery is sustained. The momentum for reforms to restore [financial sector health must also be maintained. The time to implement exit strategies will only come when deflationary risks dissipate and sustainable growth is clearly underway. But it is not too soon to design them, so as to be ready when the time comes. A sound financial system, fiscal sustainability and price stability should be the foundation of these strategies. We look forward to hearing your views and insights on [the road to Istanbul. A key issue I see is how to foster in the next phase the global cooperation that helped stem the crisis. I will be sharing some thoughts on that in the days ahead. ", "index": 796}]
