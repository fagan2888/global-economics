 By [Shekhar Aiyar, [Bergljot Barkbu, and [Andreas (Andy) Jobst Jobst" ) If financing is the lifeblood of European small businesses, then the effect of the financial crisis was similar to a cardiac arrest. The flow of affordable credit from banks was choked off and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were hit hardest. Today, with bank lending still recovering from that shock, smart policy actions could open up securitization as a source of financing to help small businesses start up, flourish and grow.

This dependence makes them vulnerable to banking sector difficulties. When the crisis hit, banks raised interest rates and rationed credit to SMEs more tightly than for larger firms.
