 [By [Olivier Blanchard The global financial crisis gave economists pause for thought about what should be the [future of macroeconomic policy. We have devoted much of our thinking to this issue these past three years, including how the many policy instruments work together. **[The interactions between [monetary and macroprudential policies, in particular, remain hotly debated. And this year's [IMF Annual Re[sea[rch Conference is an important opportunity to take that debate another step forward. ** Looking back, it is striking how many papers from [last year's conference'on [post- crisis macroeconomic and financial policies'have been so immediately relevant to events on the ground. Just to give you an example: the paper on [fiscal space is obviously front and center in the policy debate on the European sovereign crisis, the United States' budget, and challenges faced by advanced country governments more generally. This year's topic'monetary and macroprudential policies'is equally relevant. It goes to the core of central banks' mandates, and their role in achieving macroeconomic and financial stability. The financial crisis triggered a fundamental rethinking of these issues, but much research, both conceptual and empirical, remains to be done. The conference provides an excellent opportunity to engage with prominent academics, policymakers and private sector practitioners. I hope the conference will contribute to expanding the frontier of knowledge on this topic. The conference [program lays the ground for an exciting debate. **Professor Hyun Song Shin of Princeton University will give the keynote _[Mundell-Fleming address_. He will talk about the role of international factors in determining domestic financial conditions.** We saw a good illustration of this in the run-up to the recent financial crisis, when European global banks intermediating U.S. dollar funds eased credit conditions in the United States. Clearly, such international linkages need to be taken into account when choosing an appropriate mix of monetary and macroprudential policies. Eleven other papers we have on the program each touch on a critical aspect of the intersection between monetary and macroprudential policies. Just to give you a flavor of what to expect, here are some of the questions we will be discussing: * Should monetary policy lean against credit and asset price bubbles, or should this task be delegated squarely to macroprudential policy? * What if macroprudential policy is only partially effective because it encourages regulatory arbitrage and other 'leakages'¬ù? Does this imply that monetary policy should weigh in, too? * What if the government does not have full information on the riskiness of new financial instruments? Will it be able to set macroprudential policies at the levels that will ensure lasting financial stability? * How can policymakers guard against the possibility that monetary tightening may encourage excessive risk-taking by financial institutions that find themselves in distress at higher interest rates? * How should macroprudential policies be coordinated internationally if they have cross-border repercussions? In addition to the Mundell-Fleming Lecture, the conference will feature three other policy-oriented events. [David Lipton, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, will open the conference.
