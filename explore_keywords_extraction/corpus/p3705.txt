 As **iMFdirect** looks back at two years since our blog on global economics was launched in August 2009, we've compiled a list of the posts that have drawn the most attention. Collectively,** the posts give a snapshot of some of the biggest challenges in the world economy**'which because of this summer's developments remain, in some ways, much the same today as two years ago. It's worth noting that [John Lipsky's outlook for 2011 listed as the No. 1 downside risk to the global economy: 'Renewed turbulence in sovereign debt markets could spill over to the real economy and across regions.'¬ù From the start our aim has been to stimulate debate about global economic issues and to open up discussion, through the blog, to a broader audience. During the past two years we've had more than 200 posts from leading economists, including several Nobel Prize winners. Many have been reproduced by other blogs around the world and hundreds of people have provided comment and feedback, and participated in constructive debate. Here are the** iMFdirect** posts that have drawn the highest number of views: 1\. [Ten Commandments for Fiscal Adjustment in Advanced Economies 2\.
