As Frank Sinatra crooned about love and marriage, so it seems about jobs and growth: _'This I tell ya, brother, you can't have one without the other.'_ The IMF's latest [_World Economic Outlook_ projects global growth of 3 Â? percent this year. To the person on the street, what matters is how this growth translates into jobs and wages. The news on the jobs front, unfortunately, remains grim.

The bulk of this increase in unemployed people has been in the so-called advanced economies (the IMF's term for countries with high per capita incomes), as shown in the chart below. [ Why isn't the jobs picture better? Quite simply, it's because the growth picture isn't very good. Consider Chart 2, which shows how for advanced economies the change in unemployment rates expected between 2011 and 2012 correlates with the IMF's forecasts for growth this year.

The average unemployment rate in these economies is expected to 7 Â¾ percent,
