 By [Era Dabla-Norris, [Vikram Haksar, and [Kalpana Kochhar Global growth remains anemic more than five years after the global financial crisis. If nothing is done, the prospect of settling into a 'new mediocre'¬ù will become reality, especially in advanced economies. In many advanced economies, accommodative monetary policies, growth-friendly fiscal frameworks, and efforts to tackle private debt overhang and improve tax revenues and compliance are essential to lift economic growth in the short term. To jumpstart and sustain growth over the longer-term, reforms to strengthen labor force participation, raise productivity by removing impediments to efficient allocation of resources, encourage competition, and encourage innovation and technology-uptake are crucial. The key question is how to identify, prioritize, and calibrate the reforms that best suit each country's situation. We look closely at what can be done to boost potential growth in a [new study that examines trends in productivity and labor and capital inputs in different sectors and across countries. **Problem started before the crisis** Continued sluggish growth in advanced economies partly reflects the scale of the public and private balance sheet damage that occurred during the crisis and the slow process of shedding debt since then. But the underlying output and productivity growth in most advanced economies had, in fact, already been slowing well before the global financial crisis (Figure 1). This trend may have been masked by the ups and downs of the financial cycle, along with some productivity bursts driven by technology and reforms before the crisis. [ To boost jobs and growth, we at the IMF have advocated measures to increase labor force participation, especially by increasing economic opportunities for women (see [here). More broadly, the slowdown in productivity even prior to the crisis puts a high premium on reforms in labor and product markets, increasing infrastructure investment, and incentivizing innovation and skills development.
