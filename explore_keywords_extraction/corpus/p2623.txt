 [By [Masood Ahmed Recent popular protests in the Middle East and North Africa region, although likely to have a negative economic impact in the short run, might actually help to unleash the countries' long-term growth potential. **By providing the impetus for reforms, these events may encourage better governance, greater transparency, and more competition**'in other words, tackling many of the constraints that have held back progress in these societies. The economic and social costs of [chronically high unemployment in the region have been on our radar for some time. And [late last year, I emphasized that 'the region can no longer afford the status quo.' **Creating opportunities for the private sector to provide more jobs is the major policy priority. **As the [Managing Director stressed, this is particularly important in those countries 'where unemployment has been a problem for many years'. **We also need to accept that measures will be needed to ease the human costs of today's social pressures.** But, to ensure that these social protections can continue to be provided over time, the priority should be designing a well-targeted social safety net. In contrast to generalized subsidies that benefit everyone, well-targeted schemes provide assistance only to those most needy. This means assistance that targets people, not products. In a recent interview (video below), I talk more about events in the region, the policy challenges, and what actions might help these countries recognize their full potential.
