 [ By [Carlo Cottarelli ( We've just updated our [latest assessment of the state of government finances, debts, and deficits in advanced and emerging economies. Fiscal adjustment is continuing in the advanced economies at a speed that is broadly appropriate, and roughly what we projected three months ago. **In emerging economies there's a pause in fiscal adjustment this year and next**, but this too is generally appropriate, given that many of these countries have low debt and deficits. **The improvement in fiscal conditions in many advanced economies is welcome**, but it's going to take more than lower deficits to get countries under market pressure out of the crosshairs. **Signs of Progress** There are clear signs of fiscal progress in advanced economies. The deficit will decline in about three quarters of advanced economies this year, and in almost 90 percent of them next year. Debt ratios are also starting to come down: we project one-third of advanced economies to have a declining debt ratio this year and half of them to do so next year. The progress in deficit-cutting in **Europe** means less fiscal tightening will be needed in the future, reducing the fiscal drag on growth: in 2011'12 the fiscal tightening in the euro area will amount to a cumulative 2Â? percentage points of GDP, while in 2013'14 it is projected to be one third of this, which is good news for growth. On the other hand, in the **United States** there is a risk that fiscal consolidation will increase dramatically next year, with the economy going over the 'fiscal cliff' of expiring tax cuts and of automatic spending cuts. A much more contained deficit decline would be preferable, and should be introduced in the context of a medium-term fiscal adjustment plan. There has been some weakening in the projected fiscal accounts in **emerging economies**. Many countries are now expected to show higher than anticipated deficits this year and next. This weakening in fiscal deficits reflects the deceleration in economic activity in the context of relatively stronger fiscal positions. There are a few countries where a more ambitious fiscal adjustment strategy is called for, but in most cases emerging economies have more fiscal space and some of them are using it wisely to cushion their economies against the impact of developments elsewhere. **Spreads not fully aligned with fundamentals** In spite of the progress in adjusting their fiscal accounts, **bond spreads remain very high for some euro area countries**'higher than what could be explained by fundamentals like debt and deficits, growth, and inflation. Italy and Spain pay spreads that are some 200'250 basis points above their fundamental level.
