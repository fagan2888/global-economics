 [ By [Olivier Blanchard ( The [global recovery continues, but the recovery is weak; indeed a bit weaker than we [forecast in April. In the **Euro zone**, growth is close to zero, reflecting positive but low growth in the core countries, and negative growth in most periphery countries. In the **United States**, growth is positive, but too low to make a serious dent to unemployment. Growth has also slowed in major emerging economies, from **China** to **India** and **Brazil**. Downside risks, coming primarily from Europe, have increased. Let me develop these themes in turn. **Our baseline forecasts** In Europe, we are observing an increasing divergence between core and periphery countries. Periphery Euro countries, including **Italy and Spain**, face a difficult adjustment. Fiscal consolidation is necessary, but weighs heavily on growth. Structural reforms will bear fruit, but only in the future. Banks have to deal not only with bad legacy loans, but also with increasing non-performing loans, which reflect depressed economic activity. High debt burdens are making borrowing expensive for governments. The result is negative growth this year and next for both Italy and Spain.
