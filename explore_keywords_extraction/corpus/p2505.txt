 [By [Benedict Clements ( **Health care reform is tricky. On the one hand, providing access to affordable health care is of paramount importance. But spending on health care is putting enormous pressure on public purses all over the world, and it's only getting worse. **How can we fix this? How can governments keep their health care promises to citizens without busting the budget? A [recent paper by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department tries to help with these choices, presenting public health spending projections for fifty advanced and emerging countries, and posing reform options. ## **_Advanced economies_** Let's start with the basics. **In advanced economies, health care spending alone accounted for about half of the rise in government budgets in the past 40 years. If we do nothing, these costs will continue to soar. **Public health spending is projected to climb by 3 percentage points of GDP over the next 20 years in the advanced economies. The increases in health spending are driven by population aging but more importantly by technical progress and the availability of better and more expensive technologies. This is simply not affordable. **Reforms are needed to control spending, but these reforms must also be equitable, protecting access to basic health care for all who need it, especially the poor.** The situation appears dire, but there are options. Past experience suggests that reforms can help slow the growth of spending in an efficient and equitable manner. We find that the most promising reform strategies combine top-down budget control and bottom-up reforms to improve efficiency. **Budget systems that cap total health expenditures and impose a high degree of central oversight can provide powerful incentives for expenditure restraint.** Among the countries with a history of the lowest increases public spending, Italy, Japan, and Sweden have a greater reliance on budget caps. **Bottom-up reforms help control costs by enhancing efficiency. This allows more and better service delivery to patients for a given amount of resources. **Some examples include: * _Strengthening market mechanisms_: increasing patient choice of insurers, allowing greater competition between insurers and providers, and relying on a greater degree of private sector provision (e.g. Germany and Japan). * _Changing the way doctors and hospitals are paid_: moving away from reimbursement to providers after services are rendered (fee for service) towards more sophisticated management and contracting systems. These systems include built-in incentives for providers to minimize waste and improve services (e.g. Germany and Italy). * _Greater reliance on private insurance_ can also help slow down the growth of public health spending (e.g.
