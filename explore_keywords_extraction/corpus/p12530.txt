 by [iMFdirect Raghuram Rajan is charged with monetary stability in one of the world's leading emerging economies as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Listen to this [podcast interview with the policymaker as he discusses why countries need a global financial safety net in an era of potential dramatic overnight changes in a country's economic and financial fortunes, whether triggered from without or within. To prepare for sudden stops or withdrawals of money out of a country, Rajan says you can build reserves, so if money flows out you have enough to protect the value of your currency, or protect you from a bank run.
