 By [iMFdirect **_'If we're fighting each other because we can't design a system that actually works for everybody, then working people will again continue to mistrust our institutions, and the threat to democracy is very real; you see it.' ' _**Sharan Burrow Burrow is General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, and in this [podcast she says collective action is needed to help better distribute the benefits of growth. As head of the world's largest trade union federation, Burrow lays out'in no uncertain terms, what today's 'stagnating' economy means for the 3 billion people in the global workforce. 'It's certainly not delivering jobs'even where there is growth, particularly for women and young people who are extraordinarily vulnerable.' While Burrow supports trade and globalization, she says it's been built on a low wage, labor arbitrage system that has left too many people in insecure and unsafe work. Burrow also talks about how women's workforce participation'after having grown significantly in recent years'has come to a near halt, and points out how this is counter-productive. 'The two most significant areas of growth for jobs is investment in infrastructure, and for immediate productivity gains'it's women's participation in work,' she added. Listen to the podcast here:
