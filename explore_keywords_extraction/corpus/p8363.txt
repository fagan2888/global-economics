 By iMFdirect editors What a week it's been. Practical and existential questions on how to do good and _be_ good for the sake of the global economy and finance dominated the seminars at the IMF's Annual Meetings in Washington. Our editors fanned out to cover what the panelists, moderators, and audiences said in a variety of seminars, and two big themes caught our eye. **Jobs &amp; growth** With the [global economy stuck in a low growth, [high unemployment rut, how to reverse these trends is a hot topic. The average unemployment rate in developed economies stands at 8.5 percent, and among young people it's 13 percent, Christine Lagarde said in a [day-long seminar on jobs and growth. Inequality has reached critical levels. 'The world's richest 85 individuals control as much wealth as the world's poorest 3.5 billion people,' she said, citing research from Oxfam. Even economists know money can't buy happiness, but it can buy a country bridges and roads. While spending on infrastructure is a good for growth, who pays and what it means for the public purse is another matter. And more important, can it over come the world economy's lethargy, [particularly in Europe? 'Yes, yes, yes', affirmed Larry Summers of the University of Harvard. Others were a bit wary. 'Will it come at the expense of something else that is valuable for growth, such as education, or research and development?' said Christina Romer of the University of California at Berkeley.

Drawing on the first three sessions, this concluding session brings together policy makers to discuss the important dilemmas and tradeoffs that countries grapple with as they seek to implement reforms to deliver job-rich and inclusive growth.

Paul Krugman, columnist for the New York Times and professor at Princeton University said the phrase 'fiscal space' disturbs him a little. 'The idea that we can adequately say how much a country can really take on is not necessarily right,' [said Krugman. 'The notion that there are hard limits is simply not borne out by events. Fiscal space should not be a reason to not spend at a time when you should be spending.' Still, [Stanley Fisher, vice chair of the U.S. Fed, said in terms of what can be done 'much depends on the politics of each country.' [ Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President, Eurogroup participates in a CNN Debate at the 2014 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings at George Washington University, Lisner Auditorium October 9, 2014 in Washington.
