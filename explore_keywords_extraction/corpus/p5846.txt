 [ by [Olivier Blanchard Version in [EspaÃ?ol and [Ø¹Ø?Ø¨Ù? Optimism is in the air, particularly in financial markets. And some cautious optimism may indeed be justified. Compared to where we were at the same time last year, acute risks have decreased. The United States has avoided the fiscal cliff, and the euro explosion in Europe did not occur. And uncertainty is lower. But we should be under no illusion. There remain considerable challenges ahead. And the recovery continues to be slow, indeed much too slow. Put poetically: We may have avoided the cliffs. But we still face high mountains. **A year ago, we were worried about two short term risks:** We were worried that gridlock might lead to excess fiscal consolidation in the **United States**. And that firewalls in **Europe** may not be strong enough to prevent a crisis in **Spain** or **Italy**. The agreement reached at the end of 2012 in the United States does not solve the fiscal problems, but the extent of fiscal consolidation in 2013 should be roughly appropriate. In **Europe**, progress on a number of fronts, from the Outright Monetary Transaction program put in place by the **European Central Bank** to buy government bonds on a conditional basis, to the start of a **banking union**, has convinced financial markets that the firewall was indeed there, and that Europe was committed to the euro. Still, **we have not yet turned the page**. The world recovery continues to be hampered by the need for fiscal consolidation'the reduction of government debt and deficits' and by a still weak financial system. **A brief world tour** The challenges clearly remain highest in the countries of the euro area periphery. We forecast that some countries will have another year of recession, with -1.0 percent growth in Italy, and -1.5 percent for Spain. The adjustment process is at work. Competitiveness is starting to improve, and export market shares are increasing. Sovereign spreads have decreased. Cross border imbalances have stabilized, and in some cases started to reverse. Yet, **interest rates are still too high, the required fiscal adjustment still large, and uncertainty still very much present, all leading to low demand and low output**. Core euro area countries are doing only a bit better. They are forecast to have positive but anemic growth: 0.6 percent for **Germany**, and 0.3 percent
