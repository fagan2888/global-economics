 [By [Olivier Blanchard Today we released our update of the [World Economic Outlook. **_The world economy remains in 3-speed mode. Emerging markets are still growing rapidly. The US recovery is steady. And much of Europe continues to struggle. _** There is however a twist to the story. Growth almost everywhere is a bit weaker than we forecast in April, and the downward revision is particularly noticeable in emerging markets. After years of strong growth, the BRICS in particular are beginning to run into speed bumps. This means that the focus of policies will increasingly need to turn to boosting potential output growth or, in the case of China, to achieving more sustainable and balanced growth. **What the Numbers Show** Growth in **emerging market and developing economies** is forecast to be 5.0% in 2013. This is 0.3% less than in our April forecast. It is forecast to increase to 5.4% in 2014, but this is also a 0.3% downward revision relative to what we said in April. Looking specifically at the major emerging market economies: Growth in China is forecast to be 7.8% in 2013, a downward revision of 0.3%; growth in India is forecast to be 5.6%, down 0.2%; growth in Brazil is forecast to be 2.5%, down 0.5%; growth in Russia is forecast to be 2.5%, down 0.9%. In all four cases, we have also revised down our earlier forecasts for 2014, by similar or even larger amounts. **Turning to advanced countries, **growth in the United States is forecast to be 1.7% in 2013, a downward revision of 0.2%. But growth is expected to increase back to 2.7% in 2014. And we continue to predict negative growth in the **Euro** in 2013, at -0.6%, again a downward revision of 0.2%. This reflects not only large negative growth in Spain and Italy, but also low growth in the core countries. Growth in the Euro should turn positive in 2014, but will remain very low. The odd country out continues to be **Japan**. We forecast 2.0% growth for 2013, an upward revision of 0.5%, but only 1.2% for 2014, a downward revision of 0.3%. **The Story Behind these Numbers ** The slowdown in the **major emerging market economies** appears to have both cyclical and, more importantly, structural components: On the demand side, the slowdown in exports coming from low growth in advanced countries is playing a role, but in each case, domestic demand, be it consumption or investment, is also contributing to the slowdown. On the supply side, the slowdown hasn't been accompanied by much of a decrease in inflation. This, and other evidence, suggests that potential output has moved more or less in line with actual output. This has an important implication: Growth in emerging market economies will remain high, but may be substantially lower than it was before the crisis. The slowdown in the **United States** is not particularly worrisome, and hides a robust recovery in private demand. Stronger than expected'as well as stronger than desirable--fiscal consolidation has been only partly offset by a stronger housing market, and this explains our downward revision. If fiscal consolidation had been weaker, growth in the US would be substantially stronger. **Europe, and in particular the Euro zone, is still struggling**. In the southern Euro periphery, improvements in relative costs are leading to increases in export shares, but this is not enough to offset a very weak internal demand. High interest rates and fiscal consolidation are clearly playing a role. And unemployment levels remain unacceptably high. Even in the core countries, forecasts have been revised down. Lower exports, and induced low investment, are playing a major role in Germany. A large
