 By [iMFdirect World trade essentially collapsed following the global financial crisis as consumers and businesses cut back spending on both domestic and foreign products. While a decline in demand helped drive down the value of global imports and exports, consumer choice played an interesting part. In our December issue of _[Finance &amp; Development magazine_ we zoom in on one aspect of the story. Using [Argentine wine exports as an example, [Natalie Chen and Luciana Juvenal show that the nominal (before inflation) value of global trade fell also because consumers bought cheaper, lower-quality goods rather than more expensive, higher-quality products. **The pinch of recession** Chen and Juvenal show that because consumption of higher-quality goods is generally more sensitive to changes in income than that of lower-quality items, a sudden reduction in income may lead to a 'flight from quality.'¬ù This means households in crisis-hit countries reduce not only the quantity but also the quality of the goods they consume. This, in turn, should lead to a bigger contraction in higher- than in lower-quality imports. The authors investigate whether the global financial crisis induced such a flight from quality; in the case of wine made in Argentina, that turned out to be the case. For more news and analysis about Argentina, you can read our recent [blog about the IMF's annual check-up of the country's economy.
