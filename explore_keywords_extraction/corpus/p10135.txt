 By iMFdirect For a man who declared on his arrival at the IMF 'I do not blog,' Olivier Blanchard, our soon-to-be former Chief Economist, is one hell of a blogger. Prolific and popular. A demi-god: half economist, half artist. Blanchard writes the way he thinks: sharp, frank, and intellectual, while pushing against the edges of his _mÃ©tier_ with the creativity and honesty of a singular economist. To mark his departure, we've pulled together some of the most read and talked about of his blogs for iMFdirect over the years.
