 By[ Jeff Hayden Strong performance by many African economies over the past two decades led some commentators to coin the term 'Africa Rising' to describe the region's surging economic power. The term graced the cover of _TIME_ magazine in December 2012, in an issue that chronicled the region's decades-long journey from economic anemia to impressive vigor. Beginning in the mid-1990s, many'but certainly not all'countries in sub-Saharan Africa energized their economies, achieving in recent years some of the world's highest growth. Living standards improved as a result, as did health care and other key services, inspiring hope for a bright future. The past year has been harsh, however, as the region suffered a sharp slowdown, owing to slumping commodity prices and softer global economic conditions. Drought has struck in some countries. And China'now a major trade and business partner in a number of African countries'is slowing as it retools its economy, sparking fears of further weakening. A wave of pessimism is taking hold, prompting some to wonder if the Africa Rising story has come to an end. This issue of _F&amp;D_ looks at this critical moment for Africa and brings together articles suggesting that many countries are well positioned to ride out this storm despite the toughest conditions in a decade. Our writers express hope that strong growth will resume, albeit with a pause or two along the way In his overview, Georgetown University's Steven Radelet documents [changes that leave Africa better positioned to handle this downturn. Marked improvements in governance, the emergence of more adroit leaders and economic managers, and better economic and social policies are a solid foundation for future growth. Although likely to slow in the next few years, he says, the long-term outlook for growth is solid for countries that diversify their economies, increase competitiveness, and further strengthen their institutions of governance. Antoinette Sayeh, head of the IMF's African Department, sounds a similar note in her [Straight Talk column, arguing that the underlying drivers of growth over the past decade still persist and that a reset of monetary and fiscal policies can help reignite sustainable growth in the region. Other articles in our Africa feature look at sources of future growth: [digital technologies that increase access to financing, [regional economic agreements that foster closer business ties, [increased women's participation in the workforce, and a [focus on improving infrastructure and [health care. We also take a look at a sector that exemplifies Africa's growing influence and economic energy: [Nigeria's film industry, or 'Nollywood,' one of the world's largest film industries in terms of number of films produced. Elsewhere in this issue, we are pleased to offer an article on [U.S. growth by Robert J. Gordon, whose recent book, _The Rise and Fall of American Growth_, has stirred much thought about the prospects for a long period of muted growth in the United States. Finally, Prakash Loungani profiles iconoclastic economist [Dani Rodrik.
