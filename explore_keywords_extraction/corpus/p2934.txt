 By [iMFdirect **Open, wide-ranging, and balanced discussion.** For Olivier Blanchard'and co-hosts David Romer, Michael Spence &amp; Joseph Stiglitz'that was the goal of [last month's conference at the IMF on the [future of macroeconomic policies after the global financial crisis. And it is exactly what they got. The crisis was a wakeup call for theorists and policymakers'¦ **Economic models, policy tools, and how they are applied need to catch up with changes in the global economic _and_ financial system.** You've heard here about views from the conference, but there's plenty of discussion going on outside the IMF. Here's a snapshot'¦. * The openness to rethinking the 'prevailing macroeconomic policy paradigm', led Paul Krugman to speculate that [IMF might stand for 'Impressive Macroeconomic Flexibility'. He later talked about what would [change his mind about how the economy works. * While the conference was 'interesting and stimulating', Anders Aslund has concerns that it revealed a division ['between the Anglo-American macroeconomic mainstream and the rest of the world.' * Mark Thoma stirred a [meaty discussion in response to [questions posed for the conference. * By [addressing the big questions, the IMF conference was 'trying to stir a reexamination of mainstream macroeconomists' framework ' which largely ignored finance'. * But how to address financial sector risk is tricky issue. Paul Romer's [presentation resonated with Matthew Yglesias'a rules-based system of financial regulation could simply be a ['fixed target for canny bankers to exploit and undermine.' * Another question posed at the conference'["Does the financial system have social value?"'was one that Floyd Norris thought would not have been asked at the IMF a few years ago. * And, [Should High-Frequency Trading Be Banned? One Nobel Winner Thinks So. * Still high unemployment did not go overlooked, but Krugman feels that anyone focusing on it ['instead of slashing spending now now now can expect to face harsh attacks, which leads all too many to shy away from the current policy debate'. * The conference would be ['a turning point in mainstream economic debate' according to Perry Mehrling, and the videos would be a ["brilliant" ongoing resource for students and academics. ****************** **Other conference-related posts:** * Video interview with Robert Solow on [New Policy Ideas for a New World * [Observations on the Evolution of Economic Policies, by Michael Spence * [A Balanced Debate About Reforming Macroeconomics, by Joseph E.
