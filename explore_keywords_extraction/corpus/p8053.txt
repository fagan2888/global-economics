Which brings us to what will or won't happen with [global interest rates, and their impact on well, pretty much everyone. We've analyzed the tea leaves so you don't have to. New rumblings in emerging market economies mean it's probably a good idea for you to have another look at [who owns emerging market debt. Just in case.

And speaking of other countries, [growth in low-income countries is on the move in ways you might not have expected.
