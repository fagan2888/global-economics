 By [iMFdirect In the past two decades, low-income economies have seen a rise in growth, with fewer living in poverty. Yet inequality in many countries has remained virtually unchanged. A recent IMF paper explains how the design of policies can matter to spread the economic benefits of growth more broadly. Over the long haul, reforms can indeed yield bridges, banks, firms and fields of grain. But these take time, and the poorest cannot always wait for the transformation without additional help.
