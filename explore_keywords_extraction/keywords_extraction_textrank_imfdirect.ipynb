    "Methodology of automatic keyphrase extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify: a set of words and phrases that could convey the topical content of a document are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract: candidates are scored/ranked and the “best” are selected as a document’s keyphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Candidate Identification__\n",
    "\n",
    "* remove stop words and punctuation; \n",
    "* filter for words with certain parts of speech;\n",
    "* (or) filter for multi-word phrases, certain POS patterns;\n",
    "* use external knowledge bases like WordNet or Wikipedia as a reference source of good/bad keyphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Options__\n",
    "\n",
    "* take all of the n-grams (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5)\n",
    "* limit candidates to only \"noun phrases\" matching the POS pattern '{(<JJ>* <NN.*>+ <IN>)? <JJ>* <NN.*>+}' (a regular expression written in a simplified format used by NLTK’s RegexpParser()). This matches any number of adjectives followed by at least one noun that may be joined by a preposition to one other adjective(s)+noun(s) sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Keyphrases extraction__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unsupervised Algorithms\n",
    "    * no \"training data\" needed\n",
    "    * graph-based ranking method: document = network with nodes as candidate keyphrases and whose edges (optionally weighted by the degree of relatedness) connect related candidates. Implementation: Graph-based ranking algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Supervised Algorithms\n",
    "    * need text with already-labeled examples (“training data”)\n",
    "    * Two primary developments deal with __task reformulation__ and __feature design__\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task Refolmulation\n",
    "\n",
    "__Binary classification problem__: some fraction of candidates are classified as keyphrases and the rest as non-keyphrases. Methods: Naive Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines. Problems: this reformulation of the task is conceptually problematic; humans judge keyphrases in relative sense (not independent from one another).<br>\n",
    "Implementation - KEA (as published in Practical Automatic Keyphrase Extraction), used TF*IDF and position of first occurrence (while filtering on phrase length) to identify keyphrases\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ranking problem__: a function is trained to rank candidates pairwise according to degree of “keyness”. The best candidates rise to the top, and the top N are taken to be the document’s keyphrases.<br> Implementation - Linear Ranking SVM to rank candidate keyphrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Feature design\n",
    "\n",
    "* __frequency statistics + other statistical features__: phrase length (number of constituent words), phrase position (normalized position within a document of first and/or last occurrence therein), and “supervised keyphraseness” (number of times a keyphrase appears as such in the training data). \n",
    "* __structural features__: titles, abstracts, intros and conclusions, metadata etc.\n",
    "* __external resource-based features__: “Wikipedia-based keyphraseness” assumes that keyphrases are more likely to appear as Wiki article links and/or titles.\n",
    "* __phrase commonness__: compare a candidate’s frequency in a document with respect to its frequency in an external corpus."

    "__score_keyphrases_by_textrank__ function is one of the two implementations of the TextRank algorithm. Only unigram candidates (not chunks or n-grams) are added to the network as nodes, the co-occurrence window size is fixed at 2 (so only adjacent words are said to “co-occur”), and the edges between nodes are unweighted (rather than weighted by the number of co-occurrences). The N top-scoring candidates are taken to be its keywords; sequences of adjacent keywords are merged to form key phrases and their individual PageRank scores are averaged, so as not to bias for longer keyphrases."
