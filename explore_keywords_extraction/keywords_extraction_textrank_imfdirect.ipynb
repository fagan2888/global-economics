    "### Score keyphrases by textrank\n",
    "__score_keyphrases_by_textrank__ function is one of the two implementations of the TextRank algorithm. Only unigram candidates (not chunks or n-grams) are added to the network as nodes, the co-occurrence window size is fixed at 2 (so only adjacent words are said to “co-occur”), and the edges between nodes are unweighted (rather than weighted by the number of co-occurrences). The N top-scoring candidates are taken to be its keywords; sequences of adjacent keywords are merged to form key phrases and their individual PageRank scores are averaged, so as not to bias for longer keyphrases."
